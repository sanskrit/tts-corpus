12.15 That person who is engaged in Karma Yoga does not become the cause
of 'fear to the world'; he does nothing to cause fear to the world. He
has no cause to 'fear the world,' i.e., no action on the part of others
can cause him fear because of the certainty that he is not inimical to
the world. Therefore he is not in the habit of showing favour towards
someone and intolerance towards others; he has no fear of some or
repulsion for others. Such a person is dear to Me.
