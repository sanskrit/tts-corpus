12.17 He who does not 'rejoice', i.e., that Karma Yogin, who, on
obtaining things which cause joy to man, does not rejoice; who does not
'hate', does not hate on obtaining anything undesriable; who is not
'grieved' by common sorrows which cause grief among men, as the loss of
wife, son, fortune etc.; who 'does not desire' anything like wife, son,
fortune etc.; not already acired by him; who 'renounces good and evil,'
i.e., who renounces both merit and demerit because, like demert, merit
also causes bondage, there being no difference between them in this
respect - he who is like this and devoted to Me is dear to Me.
