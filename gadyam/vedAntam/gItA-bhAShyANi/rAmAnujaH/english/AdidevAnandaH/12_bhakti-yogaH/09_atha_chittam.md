12.9 Now, if you are unable to focus your mind immediately on Me in deep
meditation, then seek to reach Me by the 'practice of repetition
(Abhyasa Yoga)'. By the repeated practice of remembrance full of immense
love, concentrate your mind on Me the ocean of manifold attributes
innate to Me like, beauty, affability, friendliness, affection,
compassion, sweetness, majesty, magnanimity, heroism, valour, might,
omniscience, freedom from wants, unfailing resolves, sovereignty over
all, being the cause of all etc., and being antagonistic to all that is
evil. All these attributes are of unlimited excellence in the Supreme
Person.
