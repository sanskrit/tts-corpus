12.1 Arjuna said These are two types of spiritual aspirants who are
contrasted thus: (1) On the one hand there are those devotees who adore
You 'thus'; namely, in the way taught in such text as 'Whosoever works
for Me' (11.55), and who are desirous of being ever 'integrated' with
You, namely, considering You as the supreme end. They adore You in utter
devotion - You, the ocean of boundless attributes of limitless
excellence like grace, affability, omniscience, true resolve etc., and
endowed with all glory. (2) On the other hand there are those who
meditate on the 'Imperishable', (Aksara) namely, the individual self in
Its true nature, which is the same as the 'Unmanifest' (Avyakta), namely
that whose nature cannot be grasped by organs such as the eye etc. The
estion posed is: Which of these two classes of devotees have greater
knowledge of Yoga; Who would reach their respective goals sooner; Such
is the meaning of the estion. Sri Krsna clearly states later on, 'O
Arjuna, I become before long their redeemer from the fatal sea of
recurring births and deaths' (12.7), with reference to the speed with
which the latter kind of devotees reach Him.
