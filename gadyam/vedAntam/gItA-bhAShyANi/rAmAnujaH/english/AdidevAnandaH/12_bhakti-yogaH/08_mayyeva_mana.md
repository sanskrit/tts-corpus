12.8 'Focus your mind on Me alone,' on account of My being the
unsurpassed end of human endeavour and on My being easily attainable
without delay. Focus your mind in meditation on Me alone. Let your
Buddhi 'enter into Me,' strengthened by the conviction that I alone am
the supreme object to be attained. Then you will 'live in Me alone,'
i.e., You will live in Me alone immediately after focusing your mind on
Me by forming the conviction that I alone am the supreme object to be
attained.
