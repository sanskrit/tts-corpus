12.6 - 12.7 But those who, with a mind 'focused on Me,' the Supreme
Self, and 'intent upon Me,' namely, holding Me as their sole object,
dedicating to Me all their actions - i.e., including all worldly actions
like eating which are meant for supporting the body, as also Vedic rites
like sacrifices, gifts, fire-offerings, austerities etc., generally done
by worldly-minded people for other purposes - worship Me and meditate on
Me with exclusive devotion, namely, with devotion without any other
purpose, adoring Me by all such acts as meditation, worship,
prostration, praises and hymns which are by themselves exceedingly dear
to them and are eal to the end itself - to these I become soon their
saviour from the sea of Samsara which, on account of its being
antagonistic to the attainment of Myself, is deadly.
