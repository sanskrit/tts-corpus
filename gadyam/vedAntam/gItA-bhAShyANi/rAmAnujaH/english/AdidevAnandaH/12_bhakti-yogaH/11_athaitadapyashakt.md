12.11 If you are unable to do even this 'taking refuge in My Yoga,'  
i.e., if you are unable even to do actions for My sake, which forms the sprout of Bhakti Yoga,  
wherein through meditation I am made the exclusive and sole object of love -  
then you should resort to Aksara Yoga described in the first six chapters. 

It consists in contemplation on the nature of the individual self.  
This engenders devotion to the Lord.  
As a means for practice of this (Aksara Yoga), renounce the fruit of every action.  

The state of mind that holds Me as the only worthy object of attainment and love arises only when all the sins of an aspirant are destroyed without exception.  

'One with a controlled mind' means one with the mind subdued. 

When the individual self is visualised to be of the nature of a Sesa (subsidiary) to the Lord,  
and when the veil of nescience consisting in identifying the self with the body is removed by contemplation on the self  
generated through the performance of works without attachment to the fruits  
and with My propitiation as the sole objective -  
then supreme Bhakti to Me will originate by itself.

\[The point driven home is this:  
It is nescience that stands between the Jiva and the Lord.  
This nescience consists in identification of the self with the body.  
It is through works done without an eye on their fruits but exclusively as an offering to the Lord, that this nescience is removed.  
Thus Karma Yoga is the sprout of self-realisation, and of Bhakti.  
On the nescience being removed, the knowledge that one (i.e., the Jiva) is a Sesa (an absolutely dependent liege) of the Lord, dawns on the Jiva.  
Such knowledge generates exclusive devotion or Bhakti accompanied by Prapatti.  
Or if the Jiva gets immersed in Its own bliss, It will attain Kaivalya.\] 

In the same manner, Sri Krsna will further show in the text beginning with 'By worshipping Him with his work will a man reach perfection' (18.46)  
and ending with 

> 'Forsaking the feeling of "I" and with no feeling of "mine" and tranquil, one becomes worthy of the state of Brahman.  
> Having realised the state of Brahman, tranquil, he neither grieves nor craves.  
> Regarding all beings alike, he attains supreme devotion to Me' (18.53-54).
