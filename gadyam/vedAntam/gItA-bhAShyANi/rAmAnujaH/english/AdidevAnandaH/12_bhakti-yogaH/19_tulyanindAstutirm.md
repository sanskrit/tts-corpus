12.18 - 12.19 The absence of hate etc., towards foes, friends etc., has
already been taught in the stanza beginning with, 'He who never hates
any being' (11.13). What is now taught is that eanimity to be practised
even when such persons mentioned above are present before one who is
superior to those having a general eanimous temperament referred to
earlier. Who has no 'home', namely, who is not attached to home, etc.,
as he possesses firmness of mind with regard to the self. Because of
this, he is 'same even in honour and dishonour.' He who is devoted to Me
and who is like this - he is dear to Me. Showing the superiority of
Bhakti-Nistha over Atma-nistha, Sri Krsna now concludes in accordance
with what is stated at the beginning of this chapter in Verse 2.
