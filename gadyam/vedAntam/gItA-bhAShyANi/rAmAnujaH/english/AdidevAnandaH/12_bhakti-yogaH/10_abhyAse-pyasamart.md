12.10 If you are incapable of practising remembrance in the above
manner, then devote yourself to 'My deeds.' Such devotional acts consist
in the construction of temples, laying out temple gardens, lighting up
lamps therein, sweeping, sprinkling water and plastering the floor of
holy shrines, gathering flowers, engaging in My worship, chanting My
names, circumambulating My temples, praising Me, prostrating before Me
etc. Do these with great affection. Even performing such works which are
exceedingly dear to Me, you will, before long, get your mind steadily
focused on Me as through the practice of repetitions, and will gain
perfection through attaining Me.
