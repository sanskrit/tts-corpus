12.2 The Lord said I consider them to be the highest among the Yogins
(i.e., among those striving for realisation) - them who worship Me
focusing their minds upon Me as one exceedingly dear to them, who are
endowed with supreme faith, and who are ever 'integrated' with Me,
namely ever desirous of constant union with Me. Those who thus worship
Me, focusing their minds on Me as their supreme goal, attain Me soon and
easily. Such is the meaning.
