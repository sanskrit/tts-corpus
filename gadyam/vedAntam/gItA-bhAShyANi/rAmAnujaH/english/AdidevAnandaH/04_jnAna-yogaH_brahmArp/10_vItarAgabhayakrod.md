4.10 Purified by the austerity called knowledge of the truth of My life
and deeds, many have become transformed in this manner. The Sruti says
to the same effect: 'The wise know well the manner in which He is born'
(Tai. A., 3.13.1). 'Dhiras' means the foremost among the wise. The
meaning is the wise know the manner of His birth thus. It is not that I
protect only those who resort to Me in incarnations in the shapes of
gods, men etc.
