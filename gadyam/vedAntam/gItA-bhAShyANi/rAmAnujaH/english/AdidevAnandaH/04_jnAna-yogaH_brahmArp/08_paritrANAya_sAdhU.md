4.8 The good are those who follow the Dharma, as defined above. They are
the foremost among the Vaisnavas, who have taken refuge in Me. While My
name, acts and form are inaccessible to speech and thought, these
devotees cannot get support, sustenance etc., for themselves without
perceiving Me. They regard even a moment's time without Me as a thousand
Kalpas. They become broken in every limb because of the separation from
Me. So I am born from age to age in the forms of gods, men etc., for
protecting them by affording them the opportunity to behold My form and
acts and to converse with Me. I am born also for the destruction of
those who are opposed to such devotees and for the restoration of
declining Vedic Dharma, which consists of My worship. The main purpose
of incarnation is the revealing of His adorable form, so that all may
worship Him. The destruction of the wicked is secondary only. There is
no specific restrictions of the Yugas like Krta, Treta etc., for the
appearance of Divine Incarnations.
