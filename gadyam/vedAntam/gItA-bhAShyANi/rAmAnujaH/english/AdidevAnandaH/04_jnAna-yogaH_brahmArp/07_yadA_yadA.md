4.7 There is no restriction as to the time of My birth; whenever the
Dharma taught by the Vedas that must be observed according to the
arrangements of the four stations and the four stages of life declines,
and Adharma, its opposite, increases, then I Myself, by My own will and
in the manner stated, incarnate Myself. Sri Krsna gives the purpose of
His birth.
