4.1 - 4.2 The Lord said This Karma Yoga declared to you should not be
considered as having been taught now merely, for creating encouragement
in you for war. I Myself had taught this Yoga to Vivasvan at the
commencement of Manu's age as a means for all beings to attain release,
which is man's supreme end. Vivasvan taught it to Manu, and Manu to
Iksvaku. The royal sages of old knew this Yoga transmitted by tradition.
Because of long lapse of time and because of the dullness of the
intellect of those who heard it, it has been almost lost.
