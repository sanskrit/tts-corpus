4.13 The whole universe beginning with Brahma and ending with a cluster
of grass, with the system of four stations divided according to Sattva
and other Gunas and by actions like self-control corresponding to the
Gunas, was created by Me. The mention of 'creation' is for illustration.
The universe is protected by Me alone and is withdrawn by Me alone. Know
Me to be the creator of his manifold actions of creation etc., but at
the same time to be non-agent. Sri Krsna explains here how this is
possible.
