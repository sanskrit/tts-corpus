4.31 He 'who offers no sacrifices,' i.e., he who does not devote himself
to obligatory and occasional actions, preceded by the performance of the
'great sacrifices' etc., will not be able to achieve human ends which
are associated with the material world and are called by the names of
virtue, wealth and worldly satisfactions. How then can the man's supreme
end called release (Moksa), which is other than these, be attained; As
Moksa, man's supreme end, has been mentioned, other objectives different
from it, are named 'this world.' That is, indeed, the material world.
\[Perhaps the idea is that all types of sacrificers should perform the
Panca-Maha-Yajnas, and take the remnants of it as their daily food. Only
in this way can we give some meaning to 'ambrosial food' connected with
the performance of all the various kinds of sacrifice mentioned in the
above verses.\]
