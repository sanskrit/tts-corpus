4.29 - 4.30 Other Karma Yogins are devoted to the practice of breath
control. They are of three types because of the differences in
inhalation, exhalation and stoppage of breath. Puraka (inhalation) is
that in which the inward breath is sacrificed in the outward breath.
Recaka (exhalation) is that when the outward breath is sacrificed in the
inward breath. Kumbhaka (stoppage of breath) is that when the flow of
both inward and outward breaths is stopped. The clause, restricting of
diet, applies to all the three types of persons devoted to the control
of breath. All these, according to their liking and capacity are engaged
in performing the various kinds of Karma Yoga beginning from the
sacrifice of material objects to the control of breath. They know and
are devoted to sacrifices comprising obligatory and occasional rituals
preceded by the performance of 'the great sacrifices'
(Panca-Maha-Yajna), as alluded to in 'Creating men along with the
sacrifices' (3.10). Because of this only, their sins are done away with.
Those who are engaged in Karma Yoga by sustaining their bodies only by
the ambrosia of sacrificial remains will go to the eternal Brahman. 'Go
to Brahman' here means realise the self which has Brahman for Its soul.
