4.21 'Free from desire' means having no attachment to the fruits of
actions. 'His intellect and mind controlled' means one whose intellect
and mind are under control. 'Giving up all possessions' means one who,
on account of his having the self as his primary objective, is devoid of
the sense of ownership in relation to Prakrti and its derivatives. One
who is thus engaged in bodily work alone as long as he lives, does not
incur any sin, i.e., does not get engrossed in Samsara. He gets the
vision of the self by Karma Yoga of this kind itself, and need not
resort to any exlusive practice of Jnana Yoga in between liberation and
the practice of Karma Yoga of the alone description.
