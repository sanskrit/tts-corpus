4.11 Whoever desirous of resorting to Me, in whatever manner they think
of Me according to their inclinations and take refuge in Me, i.e.,
resort to Me - I favour them in the same manner as desired by them; I
reveal Myself to them. Why say much here! All men who are intent on
following Me do experience, with their own eyes and other organs of
sense in all ways, i.e., in every way wished by them, My form (including
images), however inaccessible it might be to speech and thought of the
Yogins. Now, after completing the incidental topic (with regard to
divine incarnations), in order to teach the mode in which Karma Yoga
itself acires the form of Jnana, He begins to speak of the difficulty in
finding persons who are alified for Karma Yoga of this kind.
