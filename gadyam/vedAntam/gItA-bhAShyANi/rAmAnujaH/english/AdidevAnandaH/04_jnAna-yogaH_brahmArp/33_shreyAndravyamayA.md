4.33 Karma Yoga has two aspects - knowledge and material ingredients. Of
these two, the component of knowledge is superior to the component of
material ingredients. Knowledge is the culmination of all actions and of
everything else, accessories and other things helpful. This knowledge
alone, which is to be obtained by all means, is practised as
comprehended in Karma Yoga. And this knowledge being regularly
practised, reaches gradually what is ultimately attainable i.e., the
vision of the self.
