4.17 There is something which ought to be known in regard to action
(Karma) which forms the means of attaining release. So also is the case
in regard to 'multi-form or varied forms of action' (Vikarma). These are
what have acired variegation as obligatory, occasional and
desire-prompted works reiring numerous reisites. There is also something
to be known about non-action, i.e., knowledge of the self. Therefore,
deep, i.e., difficult to understand, is the way of action to be pursued
by the seeker after release. What should be known as regards multi-form
or variegated forms of Karma is that the attribution of differences
leading to differences of fruits in obligatory, occasional and
desire-prompted rites and acisition of things reired for their
performace, etc., must be renounced, realising that the Sastras aim at
only one result, i.e., release (and not several results said to accrue
from these works). This has been declared in connection with the
teaching, 'The resolute mind is one-pointed' (2.41) and is not
elaborated here. Sri Krsna explains what must be known in regard to
action and non-action.
