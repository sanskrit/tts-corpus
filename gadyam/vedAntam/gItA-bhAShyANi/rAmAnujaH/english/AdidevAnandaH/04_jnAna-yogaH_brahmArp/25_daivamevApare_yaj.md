4.25 Some Karma Yogins resort to the sacrifice relating to gods, i.e.,
the sacrifice which takes the form of worshipping gods. The meaning is
that they have steadfast devotion only in this. 'Others offer sacrifice
into the fire of Brahman solely by means of sacrifice.' Here the term,
'sacrifice' is used in the sense of the oblation, the ladle etc., reired
for performing a sacrifice and therefore they are said to constitute
'sacrificing.' These are of the nature of Brahman. 'Offer by means of
sacrifice' indicates the ladle and other implements for the
accomplishment of sacrifice.
