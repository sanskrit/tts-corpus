4.39 After attaining knowledge through instruction in the manner
described, he must have firm faith in it and the possibility of its
development into ripe knowledge. He must be intent on it, i.e., his mind
must be focussed thereupon. He must control his senses and keep them
away from all their objects. Soon will he then reach the aforesaid state
of maturity and obtain knowledge. Soon after attaining such kind of
knowledge, he will reach supreme peace, i.e., he attains the supreme
Nirvana (realisation of the self).
