4.32 Thus there are many kinds of Kamra Yoga, which are spread out for
the attainment of the Brahman. That means, they lead to the realisaion
of the true nature of the individual self. Know that all these are forms
of Karma Yoga, which have been previoulsy defined and diversified, as
born of actions. That means, know them as resulting from occasional and

the manner prescribed, you will be released. It has been stated that
actions have the form of knowledge because of the inclusion of knowledge
in them. Now Sri Krsna explains the predominance of the component of
knowledge in such actions which include knowledge within themselves.
