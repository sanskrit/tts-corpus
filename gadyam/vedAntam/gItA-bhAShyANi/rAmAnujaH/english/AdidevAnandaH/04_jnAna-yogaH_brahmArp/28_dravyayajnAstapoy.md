4.28 Some Karma Yogins perform the sacrifice of material objects. Some
worship the gods with materials honestly acired. Some practise charity,
some engage themselves in sacrifices and in making oblations into the
sacred fire. All these perform sacrifice with material objects. Some do
the sacrifice of austerity by devoting themselves to Krcchra,
Candrayana, fast, etc. Others perform the sacrifice of Yoga. Some devote
themselves to making pilgrimages to sacred sanctuaries and holy places.
Here the term Yoga means pilgrimages to sacred sancturaries and holy
places as the context relates to aspects of Karma Yoga. Some are devoted
to recitation of Vedic texts and some to learning their meaning. They
are all devoted to the practice of self-control and of strict vows,
i.e., they are men to steady resolution.
