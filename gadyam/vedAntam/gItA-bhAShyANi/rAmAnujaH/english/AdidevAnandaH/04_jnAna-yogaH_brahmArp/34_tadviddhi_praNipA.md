4.34 This is the knowledge concerning the self that has been taught by
Me in the verses beginning with 'Know that to be indestructibe' (2.17)
and ending with 'this has been given to you' (2.39). So engaged in
appropriate actions, you can learn, according to the maturity of your
competence, this wisdom from the wise, who will explain it to you, if
you attend on them through prostrating and estioning and by serving
them. The wise are those who have immediate apprehension (or vision) of
the true nature of the self. Having been honoured by you through
prostration etc., and observing your mental disposition characterised by
desire for knowledge which you have evinced by your estions, they will
teach you this knowledge. Sri Krsna now speaks of the characterisitcs of
knowledge concerning the nature of the self, in the form of direct
perception.
