4.12 All men, desirous of the fruits of their actions, 'sacrifice',
i.e., worship or propitiate Indra and other divinities only. But nobody
worships Me abandoning attachment to fruits - Me, who am the Self of
Indra and other divinities and the real enjoyer of all sacrifices. Why
is this so; Because in this world of men, fruits in the form of sons,
cattle, food etc., follow soon from their performance of such
sacrificial rites. The phrase, 'the world of men' implies heaven etc.,
also. Because the unending accumulation of evil heaped up from
beginningless time has not been exhausted, all those worldly people lack
discernment. Therefore they want rapid results and perform those rituals
which consist of the worship of Indra and other divinities for the sake
of sons, cattle, food etc., and for the sake of heaven etc. But none
with his mind anguished by Samsara and aspiring for final release,
practises Karma Yoga of the kind described above. Real Karma Yoga is My
worship. Sri Krsna now speaks of the cause which annuls the evil
obstructing the starting of Karma Yoga.
