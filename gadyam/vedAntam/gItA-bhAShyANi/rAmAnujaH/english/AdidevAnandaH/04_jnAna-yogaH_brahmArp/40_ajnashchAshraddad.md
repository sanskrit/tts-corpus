4.40 'The ignorant,' i.e., one devoid of knowledge received through
instruction, 'the faithless' or one who has no faith in developing this
knowledge taught to him, i.e., who does not strive to progress ickly,
and 'the doubting one,' i.e., one who is full of doubts in regard to the
knowledge taught - such persons perish, are lost. When this knowledge
taught to him about the real nature of the self is doubted, then he
loses this material world as also the next world. The meaning is that
the ends of man, such as Dharma, Artha and Karma which constitute the
material ends or fulfilments, are not achieved by such a doubting one.
How then can man's supreme end, release be achieved by such a doubting
one; For all the ends of human life can be achieved through the actions
which are prescribed by the Sastras, but their performance reires the
firm conviction that the self is different from the body. Therefore,
even a little happiness does not come to the person who has a doubting
mind concerning the self.
