4.22 Content with whatever chance may bring for the maintenance of the
body; 'rising above the pairs of opposites' means enduring cold, heat
and such other experiences until one has completed the practice of Karma
Yoga; 'free from ill-will;' i.e., free from ill-will towards others,
seeing his own Karma as the cause of his adversity; 'even-minded in
success and failure,' i.e., even-minded at success like victory in war,
etc., and failure therein - such a person 'is not bound,' i.e., he does
not fall into Samsara, though devoted to action without any exclusive
practice of Jnana Yoga.
