4.23 Of a person whose attachment to all objects is gone because of his
mind being established in the knowledge of the self, who is therefore
liberated from accepting all worldly possessions and who is engaged in
the performance of sacrifices etc., as described above - in the case of
such a person his beginningless load of Karma, which is the cause of his
bondgae, is completely dissolved, i.e., destroyed without leaving any
residue. So far the nature of Karma as having the form of knowledge has
been described as emerging from constant contemplation on the nature of
the self as different from Prakrti. And now Sri Krsna says that all
actions together with their ancillaries, have the form of knowledge
because of constant contemplation by the aspirant on the Supreme Person
who is the Supreme Brahman, as being his soul.
