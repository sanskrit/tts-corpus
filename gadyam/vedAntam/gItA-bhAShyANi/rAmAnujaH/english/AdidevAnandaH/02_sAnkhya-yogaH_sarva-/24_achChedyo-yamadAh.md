2.23 - 2.24 Weapons, fire, water and air are incapable of cleaving,
burning, wetting and drying the self; for, the nature of the self is to
pervade all elements; It is present everywhere; for, It is subtler than
all the elements; It is not capable of being pervaded by them; and
cleaving, burning, wetting and drying are actions which can take place
only by pervading a substance. Therefore the self is eternal. It is
stable, immovable and primeval. The meaning is that It is unchanging,
unshakable and ancient.
