2.64 Having focussed, in the way already described, the mind on Me - the
Lord of all and the auspicious object of meditation, he who goes
through, i.e., considers with contempt the sense-objects, with senses
under control and free from hate and attraction by reason of all
impurities of mind being burnt out - such a person has a disciplined
self, i.e., disciplined mind. He attains serenity. The meaning is that
his mind will be free of impurities.
