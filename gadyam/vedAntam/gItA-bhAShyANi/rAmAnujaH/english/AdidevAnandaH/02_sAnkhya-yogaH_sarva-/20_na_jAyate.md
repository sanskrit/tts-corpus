2.20 As the self is eternal for the reasons mentioned (above), and hence
free from modifications, it is said that all the attributes of the
insentient (body) like birth, death etc., never touch the self. In this
connection, as the statement, 'It is never born, It never dies' is in
the present tense, it should be understood that the birth and death
which are experienced by all in all bodies, do not touch the self. The
statement 'Having come into being once, It never ceases to be' means
that this self, having emerged at the beginning of a Kalpa (one aeon of
manifestation) will not cease to be at the end of the Kalpa (i.e., will
emerge again at the beginning of the next Kalpa unless It is liberated).
This is the meaning - that birth at the beginning of a Kalpa in bodies
such as those of Brahman and others, and death at the end of a Kalpa as
stated in the scriptures, do not touch the self. Hence, the selves in
all bodies, are unborn, and therefore eternal. It is abiding, not
connected, like matter, with invisible modifications taking place. It is
primeval; the meaning is that It existed from time immemorial; It is
even new i.e., It is capable of being experienced always as fresh.
Therefore, when the body is slain the self is not slain.
