2.30 The self within the body of everyone such as gods etc., must be
considered to be eternally imperishable, though the body can be killed.
Therefore, all beings from gods to immovable beings, even though they
possess different forms, are all uniform and eternal in their nature as
described above. The ineality and the perishableness pertain only to the
bodies. Therefore, it is not fit for you to feel grief for any of the
beings beginning from gods etc., and not merely for Bhisma and such
others.
