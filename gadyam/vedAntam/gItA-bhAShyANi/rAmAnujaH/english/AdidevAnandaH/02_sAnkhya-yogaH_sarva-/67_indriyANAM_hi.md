2.67 That mind, which is allowed by a person to be submissive to, i.e.,
allowed to go after the senses which go on operating, i.e., experiencing
sense-objects, such a mind loses its inclination towards the pure self.
The meaning is that it gets inclined towards sense-objects. Just as a
contrary wind forcibly carries away a ship moving on the waters, in the
name manner wisdon also is carried away from such a mind. \[The idea is
that the pursuit of sense pleasures dulls one's spiritual inclination,
and the mind ultimately succumbs to them unresisting.\]
