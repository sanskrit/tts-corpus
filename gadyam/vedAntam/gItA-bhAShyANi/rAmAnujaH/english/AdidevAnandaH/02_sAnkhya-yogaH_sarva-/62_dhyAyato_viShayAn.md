2.62 Indeed, in respect of a person, whose attachment to sense-objects
is expelled but whose mind is not focussed on Me, even though he
controls the senses, contemplation on sense-objects is unavoidable on
account of the impressions of sins from time immemorial. Again
attachment increases fully in 'a man who thinks about sense-objects'.
From attachment arises desire.' What is called 'desire' is the further
stage of attachment. After reaching that stage, it is not possible for a
man to stay without experiencing the sense-objects. 'From such desire
arises anger.' When a desire exists without its object being nearby,
anger arises against persons nearby under the following. 'Our desire is
thwarted by these persons.' 'From anger there comes delusion'. Delusion
is want of discrimination between what ought to be done and what ought
not to be done. Not possessing that discrimination one does anything and
everything. Then there follows the failure of memory, i.e., of the
impressions of the earlier efforts of sense control, when one strives
again to control the senses.
