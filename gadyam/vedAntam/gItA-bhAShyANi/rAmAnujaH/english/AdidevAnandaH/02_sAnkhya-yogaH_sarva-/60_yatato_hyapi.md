2.60 Except by the experience of the self, the hankering for objects
will not go away. When the hankering for the sense-objects does not go
away, the senses of even a wise man, though he is ever striving to
subdue them, become refractory, i.e., become violent and carry away
perforce the mind. Thus, the subduing of the senses depends on the
vision of the self, and the vision of the self depends on the subduing
of the senses. Conseently, i.e., because of this mutual dependence, firm
devotion to knowledge is difficult to achieve.
