2.52 If you act in this manner and get freed from impurities, your
intellect will pass beyond the tangle of delusion. The dense impurity of
sin is the nature of that delusion which generates attachment to
infinitesimal results, of which you have already heard much from us and
will hear more later on. You will then immediately feel, of your own
accord, renunciation or feeling of disgust for them all. Sri Krsna now
teaches the goal called self-realisation (Yoga) which results from the
performance of duty as taught in the passage beginning with 'Now, listen
to this with regard to Karma Yoga' (2.39) which is based on the
knowledge of the real nature of the self gained through the refinement
of the mind.
