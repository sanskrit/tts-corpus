2.59 The sense objects are the food of the senses. From the abstinent
embodied being, i.e., from one who has withdrawn his senses from
objects, these sense-objects, being rejected by him, turn away, but not
the relish for them. Relish means hankering. The meaning is that the
hankering for the sense-objects does not go away by abstinence alone.
But even this hankering will go away, when one sees that the essential
nature of the self is superior to the sense-objects and that the
realisation of this self gives greater happiness than the enjoyment of
sense-objects.
