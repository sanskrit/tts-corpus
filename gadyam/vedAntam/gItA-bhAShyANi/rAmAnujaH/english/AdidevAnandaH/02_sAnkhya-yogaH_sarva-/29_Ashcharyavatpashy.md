2.29 Among innumerable beings, someone, who by great austerity has got
rid of sins and has increased his merits, realises this self possessing
the above mentioned nature, which is wonderful and distinct in kind from
all things other than Itself. Such a one speaks of It to another. Thus,
someone hears of It. And even after hearing of It, no one knows It
exactly that It really exists. The term 'ca' (and) implies that even
amongst the seers, the speakers and hearers, one with authentic
percepetion, authentic speech and authentic hearing, is a rarity.
