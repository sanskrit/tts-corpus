2.36 Moreover, your enemies, the sons of Dhrtarastra, will make many
remarks unutterably slanderous and disparaging to heroes, saying, 'How
can this Partha stand in the presence of us, who are heroes, even for a
moment; His prowess is elsewhere than in our presence.' Can there be
anything more painful to you than this; You yourself will understand
that death is preferable to subjection to disparagement of this kind.
Sri Krsna now says that for a hero, enemies being slain by oneself and
oneself being slain by enemies are both conducive to supreme bliss.
