2.70 The river waters enter into the sea which is full by itself and is
thus the same, i.e., unchanging in shape. The sea exhibits no special
increase or decrease, whether the waters or rivers enter it or not. Even
so do all objects of desire, i.e., objects of sense perception like
sound etc., enter into a self-controlled one, i.e., they produce only
sensorial impressions but no reaction from him. Such a person will
attain peace. The meaning is that he alone attains to peace, who by
reason of the contentment coming from the vision of the self, feels no
disturbance when objects of sense like sound, etc., come within the ken
of the senses or when they do not come. This is not the case with one
who runs after desires. Whoever is agitated by sound and other objects,
never attains to peace.
