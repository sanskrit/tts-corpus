2.6 - 2.8 If you say, 'After beginning the war, if we withdraw from the
battle, the sons of Dhrtarastra will slay us all forcibly', be it so. I
think that even to be killed by them, who do not know the difference
between righteousness and unrighteousness, is better for us than gaining
unrighteous victory by killing them. After saying so, Arjuna surrendered
himself at the feet of the Lord, overcome with dejection, saying. 'Teach
me, your disciple, who has taken refuge in you, what is good for me.'
