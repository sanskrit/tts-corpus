2.61 With a desire to overcome this mutual dependence between the
subduing of the senses and vision of the self, one has to coner the
senses which are difficult to subdue on account of their attachment to
sense-objects. So, focussing the mind on Me who am the only auspicious
object for meditation, let him remain steadfast. When the mind is
focussed on Me as its object, then such a mind, purified by the burning
away of all impurities and devoid of attachment to the senses, is able
to control the senses. Then the mind with the senses under control will
be able to experience the self. As said in Visnu Purana, 'As the leaping
fire fanned by the wind burns away a forest of dry trees, so Visnu, who
is in the hearts of all the Yogins, destroys all the sins.' Sri Krsna
teaches the same here: 'He whose senses are under control, his knowledge
is firmly set.' Sri Krsna says: 'One who endeavours to subdue the
senses, depending on one's own exertions, and does not focus the mind on
Me in this way, becomes lost.'
