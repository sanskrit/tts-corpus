2.47 As for obligatory, occasional and desiderative acts taught in the
Vedas and associated with some result or other, you, an aspirant
established in Sattva, have the right only to perform them: You have no
right to the fruits known to be derived from such acts. Acts done with a
desire for fruit bring about bondage. But acts done without an eye on
fruits form My worship and become a means for release. Do not become an
agent of acts with the idea of being the reaper of their fruits. Even
when you, who are established in pure Sattva and are desrious of
release, perform acts, you should not look upon yourself as the agent.
Likewise, it is necessary to contemplate yourself as not being the cause
of even appeasing hunger and such other bodily necessities. Later on it
will be said that both of these, agency of action and desire for fruits,
should be considered as belonging to Gunas, or in the alternative to Me
who am the Lord of all. Thinking thus, do work. With regard to inaction,
i.e., abstaining from performance of duties, as when you said, 'I will
not fight,' let there be no attachment to such inaction in you. The
