2.49 All other kinds of action are far inferior to those done with
evenness of mind, which consists in the renunciation of the main result
and with eanimity towards success or failure in respect of the secondary
results. Between the two kinds of actions, the one with eanimity and the
other with attachment, the former associated with eanimity removes all
the sufferings of Samsara and leads to release which is the highest
object of human existence. The latter type of actions, which is pursued
with an eye on results, leads one to Samsara whose character is endless
suffering. Thus when an act is being done, take refuge in Buddhi
(evenness of mind). Refuge means abode. Live in that Buddhi, is the
meaning. 'Miserable are they who act with a motive for results': it
means, 'Those who act with attachment to the results, etc., are
miserable, as they will continue in Samsara.'
