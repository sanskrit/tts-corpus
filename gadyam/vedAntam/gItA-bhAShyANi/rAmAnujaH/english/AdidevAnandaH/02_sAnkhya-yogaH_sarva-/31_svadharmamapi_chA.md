2.31 Further, even though there is killing of life in this war which has
begun, it is not fit for you to waver, considering your own duty, as in
the Agnisomiya and other sacrifices involving slaughter. To a Ksatriya,
there is no greater good than a righteous war, begun for a just cause.
It will be declared in the Gita: 'Valour, non-defeat (by the enemies),
fortitude, adroitness and also not fleeing from battle, generosity,
lordliness - these are the duties of the Ksatriya born of his very
nature.' (18.43). In Agnisomiya etc., no injury is caused to the animal
to be immolated; for, according to the Vedic Text, the victim, a
he-goat, after abandoning an inferior body, will attain heaven etc.,
with a beautiful body. The Text pertaining to immolation declares: 'O
animal, by this (immolation) you will never die, you are not destroyed.
You will pass through happy paths to the realm of the gods, where the
virtuous only reach and not the sinful. May the god Savitr give you a
proper place.' (Yaj. 4.6.9.46). Likewise the attainment of more
beautiful bodies by those who die here in this war has been declared in
the Gita, 'As a man casts off worn-out garments and takes others that
are new ৷৷.' (2.22). Hence, just as lancing and such other operations of
a surgeon are for curing a patient, the immolation of the sacrificial
animal in the Agnisomiya etc., is only for its good.
