2.38 Thus, knowing the self to be eternal, different from the body and
untouched by all corporeal alities, remaining unaffected by pleasure and
pain resulting from the weapon-strokes etc., inevitable in a war, as
also by gain and loss of wealth, victory and defeat, and keeping
yourself free from attachment to heaven and such other frutis, begin the
battle considering it merely as your own duty. Thus, you will incur no
sin. Here sin means transmigratory existence which is misery. The
purport is that you will be liberarted from the bondage of
transmigratory existence. Thus, after teaching the knowledge of the real
nature of the self, Sri Krsna begins to expound the Yoga of work, which,
when preceded by it (i.e., knowledge of the self), constitutes the means
for liberation.
