2.53 Here 'Sruti' means hearing (and not the Veda). When your intellect,
which, by hearing from us, has become specially enlightened, having for
its object the eternal, unsurpassed and subtle self - which belongs to a
class different from all other entities -, then the intellect is firmly
fixed, i.e., in a single psychosis and stands unshaken. In such a
concentrated mind, purified by the performance of duties without
attachment, will be generated true Yoga, which consists in the vision of
the self. What is said is this: Karma Yoga, which presupposes the
knowledge of the real nature of the self obtained from the scriptures,
leads to a firm devotion to knowledge known as the state of firm wisdom;
and the state of 'firm wisdom;' which is in the form of devotion to
knowledge, generates the vision of the self; this vision is here called
Yoga. Arjuna, thus taught, estions about the nature of 'firm wisdom'
which constitutes the means for the attainment of Yoga and which itself
is attainable through Karma Yoga which consists in work with detachment,
and also about the mode of behaviour of a man of 'firm wisdom.'
