2.71 What are desired, they are called the objects of desire. These are
sound and other sense-objects. The person, who wants peace must abandon
all sense-objects such as sound, touch etc. He should have no longing
for them. He should be without the sense of 'mineness' regarding them,
as that sense arises from the misconception that the body, which is
really non-self, is the self. He who lives in this way attains to peace
after seeing the self.
