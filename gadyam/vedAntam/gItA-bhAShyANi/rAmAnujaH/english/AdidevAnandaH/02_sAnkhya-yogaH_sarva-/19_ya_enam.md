2.19 With regard to "This" viz., the self, whose nature has been
described above, he who thinks of It as the slayer, i.e., as the cause
of slaying, and he who thinks 'This' (self) as slain by some cause or
other - both of them do not know. As this self is eternal for the
reasons mentioned above, no possible cause of destruction can slay It
and for the same reason, It cannot be slain. Though the root 'han' (to
slay) has the self for its object, it signifies causing the separation
of the body from the self and not destruction of the self. Scriptural
texts like 'You shall not cause injury to beings' and 'The Brahmana
shall not be killed'; (K. Sm. 8.2) indicate unsanctioned actions,
causing separation of the body from the self. \[In the above otes,
slaughter in an ethical sense is referred to, while the text refers to
killing or separating the self from the body in a metaphsyical sense.
This is made explicit in the following verse\].
