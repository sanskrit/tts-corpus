2.25 The self is not made manifest by those Pramanas (means of
knowledge) by which objects susceptible of being cleft etc., are made
manifest; hence It is unmanifest, being different in kind from objects
susceptible to cleaving etc., It is inconceivable, being different in
kind from all objects. As It does not possess the essential nature of
any of them. It cannot even be conceived. Therefore, It is unchanging,
incapable of modifications. So knowing this self to be possessed of the
above mentioned alities, it does not become you to feel grief for Its
sake.
