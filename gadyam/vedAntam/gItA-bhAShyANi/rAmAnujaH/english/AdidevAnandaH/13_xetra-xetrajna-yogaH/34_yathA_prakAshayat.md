13.34 As the 'one sun' illumines 'all this world' by his radiance, so
the 'knower of the body' illumines the entire Ksetra, i.e., the body, by
Its own knowledge, within and without and from head to toe, by
conceiving 'This my body is of this nature.' This self of the said
nature is totally different from the body, because It is the knower of
the body. The body is the object of Its knowledge and is therefore
different from It, even as the illuminating sun is totally different
from the illumined world.
