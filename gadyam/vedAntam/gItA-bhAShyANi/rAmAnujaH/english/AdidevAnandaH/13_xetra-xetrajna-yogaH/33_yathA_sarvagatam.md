13.33 As the 'all-pervading ether,' though in contact with all
substances, is 'not tainted' by the alities of all these substances, as
it is 'subtle' - even so the self, though 'present in all the bodies,'
everywhere, namely, in divinities, men etc., is not contaminated by
these bodies by reason of Its extreme subtleness.
