13.4 What the 'Field is' namely, what its substance is; what it is
'like', namely, what things depend on it; what its 'modifications' are,
namely, what its transformations are; what the 'purpose' is for which it
has been originated; 'what it is,' namely, what its true nature is; 'who
it is,' namely, who the individual self is and what Its nature is like;
what Its 'powers', are, namely, what powers It possesses. All this,
