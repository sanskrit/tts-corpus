13.14 Everywhere are Its hands and feet i.e., the self in Its pure form
is able to perform everywhere the works of hands and feet. Its eyes,
heads and mouths are everywhere; It performs everywhere the task of eyes
etc. The Sruti declares; 'Without feet or hands, He moves swiftly and
seizes things; He sees without eyes, He hears without ears; (Sve. U.,
3.19). It may be said that it means that the Supreme Brahman performs
everywhere the task of hands, feet etc., even though He is devoid of
hands and feet. If 'Brahman' is taken to mean the self, it can be asked
how this power of the Supreme Brahman (namely, having hand, feet, eyes,
etc., everywhere) can be attributed to the self, then the answer is that
it is established in the Srutis that the pure individual self has the
capacity of performing the task of hands, feet etc., because It is eal
to Him. Sruti also declares: 'Then, the wise seer, shaking off good and
evil, stainless, attains the supreme eality with Him' (Mun. U., 3.1.3).
Sri Krsna will also teach later on: 'Resorting to this knowledge, It
partakes of My nature' (14.2). It exists encompassing all things,
whatever aggregate of things that exist in the world; It encompasses
them. The sense is that in Its pure state, It is all-pervasive, as It
has no limitation of space etc.
