13.25 The different type of Yogis are described herein: (1) Some with
perfect Yoga perceive the self (Atmanam) in the body with the mind
(Atmana) by meditation. (2) Others with imperfect Yoga see the self,
with mind rendered fit for Yoga, by Sankhya Yoga, namely, Jnana Yoga,
(3) Still others, (a) unalified to practise Jnana Yoga, and (b alified
but preferring an easier method, and (c) also distinguished persons like
Janaka - all these perceive the self after being alified for Yoga by
Karma Yoga which contains within itself knowledge (Jnana).
