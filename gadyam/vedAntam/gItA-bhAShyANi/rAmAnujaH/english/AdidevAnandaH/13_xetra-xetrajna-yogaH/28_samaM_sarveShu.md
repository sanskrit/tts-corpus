13.28 He who sees the Atman as It really is - he is the one who sees the
Atman as a distinct entity in all embodied beings that are composed of
Prakrti and Purusa, even in bodies of diverse nature of gods, men etc.
The true seer is one who sees the Atman as the supreme ruler in all
these bodies as the imperishable self, though the bodies are subject to
destruction. Conversely the purport is that he who sees the Atman, only
as characterised by the uneal forms of the bodies as men, gods etc., and
as possessed of birth, death etc. - such a person is perpetually caught
up in transmigratory existence.
