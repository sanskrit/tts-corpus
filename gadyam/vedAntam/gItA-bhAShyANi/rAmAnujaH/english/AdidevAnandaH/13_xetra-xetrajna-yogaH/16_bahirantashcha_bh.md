13.16 Abandoning the elements like earth etc., It can exist outside the
body. It can exist within them while performing spontaneous activities
as established in the Srutis: 'Eating, playing, enjoying with partners
or with vehicles' (Cha. U., 8.12.3). 'It is unmoving and yet moving' -
it is by nature, unmoving, It is moving when It has a body. It is so
subtle that none can comprehend It. Although existing in a body, this
principle, possessed of all powers and omniscient, cannot be
comprehended by bound ones because of Its subtlety and Its
distinctiveness from the body. It is far away and yet It is very near -
though present in one's own body, It is far away from those who are
devoid of modesty and other alities (mentioned above) as also to those
who possess contrary alities. To those who possess modesty and such
other alities, the same self is very near.
