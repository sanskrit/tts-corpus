13.17 Though the entity called the self is present everywhere in the
bodies of divinities, men etc., It is 'undivided' because of Its form
being that of the knower. However, to those who are ignorant, It appears
divided, by such forms as those of divinities etc. - 'I am a divinity,'
'man' etc. Though the self can be contemplated by way of co-ordinate
predication as one with the body in such significations as, 'I am
divinity, I am a man,' It can be known as being different from the body,
because of Its being a knower. That is why it has already been pointed
out at the beginning: 'He who knows It; (13.1). Now Sri Krsna says that
It can be known as different also on other grounds - as the 'supporter
of elements' etc. Because It supports the earth and other elements
combined in the shape of the body, the self can be known as being
different from the elements supported. The sense is that It can be known
as a separate entity. Likewise, It is that which 'devours', namely, the
consumer of physical food etc. Because, It 'devours' the food, It can be
known as an entity different from the elements. It causes 'generation' -
It is the cause of transformation of consumed food etc., into other
forms like blood etc. As eating, generating etc., are not seen in a
corpse, it is settled that the body, an aggregate of elements, cannot be
the cause of devouring food, generating of species and supporting them.
