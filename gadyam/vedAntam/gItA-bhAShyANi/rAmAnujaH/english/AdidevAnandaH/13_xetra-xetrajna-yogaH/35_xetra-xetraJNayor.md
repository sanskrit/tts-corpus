13.35 Those who discern thus in the described manner the difference, namely, the difference between the body and the knower of the body with the eye of knowledge or discrimination, and also the means of deliverance from manifested Prakrti - they attain the highest, namely, the self. They are completely delivered from bondage. Moksa is that by which deliverance is effected. The means of deliverance as already stated consists of alities beginning with modesty (13.7). They, through the knowledge already imparted concerning the differences between the body and the self, know those differences existing between them. Then learning about modesty etc., which form the means of deliverance from Prakrti that has devleoped into material elements constituting the body, they have to practise these virtues, and they will thery be absolutely delivered from bondage and will reach the self marked by infinite knowledge abiding in Its own form.
