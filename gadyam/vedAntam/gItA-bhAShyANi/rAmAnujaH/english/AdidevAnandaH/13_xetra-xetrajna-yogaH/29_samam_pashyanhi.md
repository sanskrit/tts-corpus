13.29 'The ruler' (the self) abides in the bodies of divinities and the
rest as their supporter, controller and as their Sesin (principal). He
who sees the self free from dissimilar shapes of divinities etc., and as
being of the same form of knowledge, he does not injure himself by
'himself', namely, by his mind. Therefore, as a result of seeing the
sameness of the nature of the self in every place as a knower, he
attains the 'highest goal.' What is to be reached is called 'goal'. He
attains the supreme, namely, the self in its pure form. On the contrary,
if he should view the self as dissimilar in every place, i.e.,
identifies It with the bodies, then he 'injure the self, namely, hurls
It into the middle of the ocean of Samsara.
