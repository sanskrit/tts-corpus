13.10 'Non-attachment' means freedom from attachment to things other
than the self. 'Absecne of clinging' to son, wife, home and the like
means absence of excessive affection for these beyond the limits allowed
by the Sastras. 'Constant even-mindedness' to all desirable and
undesriable events means the state of freedom from joy and grief with
regard to occurrences springing from desire.
