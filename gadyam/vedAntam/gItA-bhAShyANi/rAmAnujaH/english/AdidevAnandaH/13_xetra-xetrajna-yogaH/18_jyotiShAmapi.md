13.18 This (self) alone is the 'light' which illuminates things like the
sun, a lamp, a gem etc. It is knowledge alone in the form of the
effulgence of the self which illuminates a lamp, the sun etc. But a lamp
etc., dispel the darkness that intervenes between the sense of sight and
its subject. Their illuminating power is limited to this extent. This is
said to be beyond Tamas (darkness). The term Tamas denotes Prakrti in
its subtle state. The meaning is that the self transcends Prakrti.
Therefore, It is to be comprehended as knowledge, i.e., to be understood
as of the form of knowledge. It is attainable by means of knowledge -
such as modesty etc., already described. It is present in the heart of
all, i.e., It is specially settled, or present in the heart of all
beings like men etc.
