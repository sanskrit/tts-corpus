13.24 He who 'understands', namely, knows truly with discrimination, the
self to be thus, and also the Prakrti as having the aforesaid nature
along with Sattva and other Gunas, whose nature will be later examined,
is never born again, i.e., is never rorn conjointly with Prakrti again
in 'whatever state he may be placed,' i.e., in whatever painful
condition he may be placed in the bodies of divinities, men etc. The
meaning is that at the time when the body ceases to exist, the self will
attain the purified state characterised by boundless knowledge devoid of
evil.
