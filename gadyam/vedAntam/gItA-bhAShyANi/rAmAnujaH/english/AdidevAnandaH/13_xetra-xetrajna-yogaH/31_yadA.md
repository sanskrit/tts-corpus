13.31 When he perceives that the diversified 'modes of existence' of all
beings as men, divinities etc., are founded on the two principles of
Prakrti and Purusa; when he perceives that their existence as divine,
human, short, tall etc., is rooted in 'one' common foundation, namely,
in the Prakrti, and not in the self; when he sees that 'their
expansion', i.e., the successive proliferaton into sons, grandsons and
such varieties of beings, is from Prakrti alone - then he reaches the
brahman. The meaning is that he attains the self devoid of limitations,
in Its pure form of knowledge.
