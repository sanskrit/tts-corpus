13.22 The self, settled in a series of bodies of divinities, men etc.,
which are modifications of Prakrti, becomes attached to happiness, pain
etc., resulting from the Sattva and other alities associated with the
respective wombs, and hence engages Itself in virtuous and sinful deeds,
constituting the means for happiness, misery etc. In order to experience
the fruits of those good and evil deeds, It is born again in good and
evil wombs. Then It becomes active and conseently is born again as a
result of Its activities. As long as It does not cultivate alities like
modesty etc., which are the means for realising the self, so long Its
entanglement in Samsara continues like this. Thus, it has been declared
here that attachment causes births in good and evil wombs.
