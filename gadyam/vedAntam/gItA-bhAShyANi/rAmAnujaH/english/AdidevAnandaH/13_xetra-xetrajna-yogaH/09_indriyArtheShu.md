13.9 'Absence of desire' with regard to sense-objects means dispassion
towards all objects different from the spiritual self by the constant
awareness of the evil in them. 'Absence of egotism' means freedom from
the misconception that the self is the body, which is in reality
different from the self. This is only an illustration standing for other
misconceptions too. It indicates freedom from the feeling of possession
towards things which do not belong to one. 'Perception of evil in birth,
death, old age, disease and sorrow' means the constant contemplation on
the inevitable evil of birth, death, old age and sorrow while in the
body.
