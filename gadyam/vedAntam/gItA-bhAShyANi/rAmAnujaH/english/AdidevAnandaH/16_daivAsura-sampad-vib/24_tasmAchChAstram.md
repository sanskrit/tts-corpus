16.24 Hence, the Sastra is to be the only authority for you in
determining what should be done and what should not be done, viz., in
deciding what ought to be accepted and what ought not be accepted. You
should know, i.e., understand, neither more nor less than what
constitutes the truth and the work enjoined in the injunctions of the
Sastras which the Highest Reality called the Supreme Person revealed in
the Vedas. The Vedic injunctions are supplemented by the Dharma-sastras,
the Itihasas and the Puranas. The acts enjoined by them are the means
for reaching Him and for pleasing Him. You should perform them; you
should accept them alone.
