16.23 Here Sastra means Vedas. Vidhi stands for injunction. He who
abandons My injunction called Vedas and acts under the influence of
desire, viz., takes the path according to his own wishes, does not
attain perfection, He does not reach any Siddhi in the next world, nor
does he find the slighest happiness in this world, let alone the
attainment of the supreme state. It is not possible for him to do so.
Such is the meaning.
