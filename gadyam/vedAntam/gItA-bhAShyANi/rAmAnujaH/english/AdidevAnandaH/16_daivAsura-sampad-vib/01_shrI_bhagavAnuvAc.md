16.1 The Lord said 'Fear' is the pain arising from the awareness of the
cause which brings about pain in the form of either dissociation from
the objects of attainment or association with the objects of aversion.
The absence of this is 'fearlessness'. 'Purity of mind' is the condition
of Sattva, viz., the state of the internal organ being untouched by
Rajas and Tamas. 'Devotion to meditation on the knowledge (of the self)'
is firm adherence to the discrimination between the pure nature of the
self and Prakrti. 'Alms-giving' is the giving away of one's wealth
earned through right means to the deserving. 'Self-control' is the
practice of withdrawal of the mind from sense-objects. 'Worship' is the
performance of the fivefold duties (sacrifices) etc., of life in the
spirit of worship of the Lord without attachment to the fruits. The
'study of the Vedas' is devotion to the Vedic study with the conviction
that all the teachings of the Vedas deal with the Lord, with His
glorious nature and with the mode of worshipping Him. 'Austerity' is the
practice of penances like Krchra, Candrayana, vow on the twelfth day of
the lunar fortnight, etc., which foster capability for performing acts
pleasing to the Lord. 'Uprightness' consists of the oneness of thought,
word and deed in one's dealings with others.
