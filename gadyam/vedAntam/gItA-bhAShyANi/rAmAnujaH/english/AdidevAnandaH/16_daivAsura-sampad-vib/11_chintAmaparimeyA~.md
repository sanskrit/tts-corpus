16.11 Those who are sure to die today or tomorrow 'obsess themselves
with cares' in regard to objects the attainment of which is not possible
even by the time of death. Likewise, they look upon 'enjoyment of
desires' as their highest aim, viz., they regard the satisfaction of
sensual enjoyments as the highest aim of human life. They are convinced
that this is all, viz., they are assured that there is no value in human
life greater than this.
