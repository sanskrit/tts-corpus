16.3 'Grandeur' is the ality by virtue of which one cannot be
overpowered by the wicked. 'Forgiveness' is freedom from the feelings of
antagonism towards others even when they cause injury to oneself.
'Fortitude' is the sense of determination to do one's own duty even
under conditions of great danger. 'Purity' is fitness of the body and
the mind as prescribd in the scriptures for the performance of sacred
deeds. 'Freedom from hatred' is non-interference with others, viz.,
absence of interference in the actions of others according to their
wish. 'Over-pride' (Atimanita) is having unbridled self-esteem; freedom
from misplaced pride is meant here. These are the virtues that are found
in one who is born for the 'divine destiny.' The destiny associated with
the divinities is divine. The divinities are those who are devoted to
carry out the ;ndments of the Lord. It is their destiny. It is obedience
to the ;ndments of the Lord. The meaning is that these are endowments in
those who are born with a tendency or disposition towards them and seek
to attain their fulfilment.
