16.5 'The divine destiny,' viz., which is of the nature of submission to
My ;ndments aids liberation, viz., leads to release from bondage. The
meaning is that it leads to the eventual attainment of Myself. 'The
demoniac destiny' viz, which is of the nature of transgression of My
;ndments, is for bondage, i.e., takes one to degradation. To Arjuna who,
on hearing this, became alarmed and anxious about the classfication of
his own nature, Sri Krsna said: 'Do not be grief-ridden. Surely, you are
born for a divine destiny, O son of Pandu. The purport is that you have
a divine destiny, since you are a son of Pandu who was most eminent
among the righteous.
