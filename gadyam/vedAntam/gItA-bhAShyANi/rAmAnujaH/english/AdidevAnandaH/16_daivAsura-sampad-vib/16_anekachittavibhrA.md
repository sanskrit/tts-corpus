16.16 As do not accept the need for the help of past Karma and the Lord
for their achievements and believe them to be only due to their own
efforts, they are 'bewildered' by many thoughts, 'Thus I shall do, this
I shall accomplish, and still another I shall achieve.' In this way they
are ensnared by the net of delusion. Highly addicted to sensual
enjoyments, they die in the middle of such enjoyments and fall into foul
Naraka \[Naraka is sometimes translated as hell. This is the Christian
conception. In the Hindu view it is purgatory where through intense
sufferings the Jiva is purged of sins\].
