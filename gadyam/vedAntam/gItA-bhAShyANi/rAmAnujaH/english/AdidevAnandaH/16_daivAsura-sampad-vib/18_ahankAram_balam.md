16.18 They depend on their egoism in the form of 'I can do everything
without the help of anyone'; likewise, in performing everything they
depend on their power, 'My power is sufficient'; hence pride takes the
following form, 'There is nobody like myself. Desire takes the form of,
'Because I am so, everything is fulfilled by my mere desire.' 'Wrath
consits in conceiving, 'I shall slay those who cause evil to me.' Thus,
depending on themselves, they evince malice towards Me, the Supreme
Person abiding in their own bodies as well as in the bodies of others;
and they hate Me. They endeavour to invent fallacious arguments against
My existence, and being unable to tolerate Me, they perform all acts
like sacrifices etc., depending only on their egoism.
