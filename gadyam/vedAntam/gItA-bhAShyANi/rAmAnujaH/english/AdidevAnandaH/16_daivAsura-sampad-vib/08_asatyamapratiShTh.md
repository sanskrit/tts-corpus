16.8 They maintain that the universe is 'without truth,' viz., they do
not accept that this universe, which is the effect of Brahman denoted by
the term Satya, has Brahman for its Self. They contend that it is bereft
of any 'foundation,' viz., they do not accept that it has Brahman for
its foundation. Brahman as Ananta supports the earth and bears all the
worlds, as declared in 'This earth, sustained upon the head of this
great serpent, supports in its turn, this garland of worlds, along with
their men, demons and gods' (V.P., 2.5.27). They say that it is 'without
a Lord,' viz. they don't accept that this universe is controlled by Me,
the Lord of all, the Supreme Brahman, whose will is always true. It has
been already averred: 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed
everything' (10.8). And they also contend thus: 'What else can exist
without mutual causation;' i.e., except by the union of the male and the
female among men, beasts etc. What else exists apart from this nature;
The meaning is that nothing else is seen. Therefore the entire world is
rooted in sexual lust.
