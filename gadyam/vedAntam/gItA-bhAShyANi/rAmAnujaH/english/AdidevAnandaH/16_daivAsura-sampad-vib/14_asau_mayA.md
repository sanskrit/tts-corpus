16.14 This enemy has been slain by me, powerful as I am. I shall slay
other enemies also - I who am heoric and valiant. What is the use of the
conception of destiny, which is only an imagination of weak people of
little understanding; Similarly: I am 'the lord,' viz., I am
independent, and I am also the ruler of others. I am the 'enjoyer,'
viz., I am the enjoyer through my own powers, and not through good
fortune etc. I am 'successful,' viz., I am successful by myself and not
through any destiny etc. Likewise, I am strong and happy by myself.
