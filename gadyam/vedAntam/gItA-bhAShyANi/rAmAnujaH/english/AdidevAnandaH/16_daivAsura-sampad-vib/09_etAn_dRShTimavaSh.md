16.9 Holding this view, viz., supporting this view, these men of lost
souls do not realise that the self is different from the body. They are
of 'fele understanding,' they lack the discernment that the self is to
be known as different from the body, because of Its being the knower in
the body which is an object of knowledge such as jars etc. These are of
'cruel deeds' viz., they do much harm to everybody; they are born to
bring ruin to the world.
