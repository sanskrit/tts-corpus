16.21 Those three which constitute the 'gateway of this hell' in the
shape of demoniac nature, and are destructive of the self (Atman) - are
known as desire, wrath and greed. The nature of these has already been
explained. 'Gateway' (Dvara) means the path, the cause. Therefore, one
should renounce these three. Therefore, since they constitute the cause
of the extremely dreadful Naraka, one should wholly renounce this triad
- desire, wrath and greed.
