16.19 Those who hate Me in this manner, I hurl them, the cruel,
inauspicious and the vilest of mankind into the cycle of births and
deaths for ever, viz., old age, death etc., revolving again and again,
and even there into demoniac wombs. I hurl them into births,
antagonistic to any friendliness towards Me. The meaning is that I shall
connect them to cruel minds as would impel them to actions which lead
them to the attainment of cursed births.
