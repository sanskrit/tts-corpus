9.9 But actions like uneal creation do not bind Me. There can be no
imputation of cruelty etc., to Me, because the previous actions (Karmas)
of individual selves are the causes for the ineality of conditions like
that of gods etc. I am untouched by the ineality. I sit, as it were,
apart from it as one unconcerned. Accordingly, the author of the
Vedanta-sutras says: 'Not ineality and cruelty, on account of (creation)
being dependent, for so scripture declares' (Br. Su., 2.1.34), and 'If
it be said that there is no Karma on account of non-distinction, it is
replied that it is not proper to say so, because it is beginningless
৷৷.' (Ibid., 2.1.35). \[The idea is this: Creation has no first
beginning. It is an eternal cyclic process of creation and dissolution
of the universe. So the differentiation of Karma, Jiva and Isvara even
before creation has to be accepted. Only in the creative cycle the
differentiation becomes patent, and in the dissolved condition it
remains latent.\]
