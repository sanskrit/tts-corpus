9.4 This 'entire universe,' composed to sentient and non-sentient
beings, is pervaded by Me, the inner controller, whose 'form is not
manifest,' namely, whose essential nature is unmanifest. The meaning is
that all this is pervaded by Me, the Principal (Sesi), so that I may
sustain and rule this universe. This, the pervasion of all by the inner
controller, who is invisible to the entire group of sentient and
non-sentient beings, is taught in the following passage of the
Antaryami-brahmana: 'He who dwells in the earth ৷৷. whom the earth 'does
not know' (Br. U., 3.7.3) and 'He who dwells in the self ৷৷. whom the
self does not know etc.,' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22). Therefore 'all beings
abide in Me'; all beings rest in Me who am their inner controller. In
the same Brahmana it is taught that their existence and control are
dependent on Him, as they are subject to His control and as they
constitute His body: 'He whose body is the earth ৷৷. who controls the
earth from within' (Br. U., 3.7.3) and 'He whose body is the self ৷৷. He
who controls the self from within' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22). So also His
primacy over everything is taught. 'I am not in them,' namely, I do not
'depend' on them for My existence. There is no help derived from them
for My existence.
