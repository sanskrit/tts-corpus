9.12 Men yielding to the deluding nature characteristics of Asuras and
Raksas and not aware of My higher nature like compassion etc. When I am
in a human form, are possessed of vain hopes, i.e, their hopes remain
fruitless, and their knowledge also is vain, i.e., is fruitless. They
are so because of their erroneous understanding which fails to know that
all things, mobile and immobile, belong to Me. They are ignorant on
account of their being devoid of knowledge of truth everywhere. Whatever
they do regarding Me, the Lord of all, is done with an attitude that I
am an ordinary mortal. So their efforts go in vain. All this springs
from their partaking of the nature of Raksasas and Asuras.
