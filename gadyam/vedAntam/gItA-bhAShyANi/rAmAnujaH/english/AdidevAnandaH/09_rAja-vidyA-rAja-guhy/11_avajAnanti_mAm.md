9.11 Because of their evil actions (Karmas), fools disregard Me - the
great Lord of all beings, the Omniscient, whose resolves are true, who
is the sole cause of the entire universe, and who has taken the human
body out of great compassion so that I might become the refuge of all.
They consider Me to be a man like themselves. The meaning is that they
disregard Me, not knowing My higher nature which is an abode of
compassion, generosity, condescension and parental solicitude. This
nature of mine is the cause of My resorting to the human shape. But
without understanding this, the ignorant consider Me as of the same
nature as others, because I have assumed the human form.
