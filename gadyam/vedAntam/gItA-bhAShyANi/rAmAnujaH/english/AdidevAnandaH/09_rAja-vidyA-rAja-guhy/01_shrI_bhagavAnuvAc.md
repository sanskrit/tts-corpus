9.1 The Lord said I will declare to you, who does not cavil, this most
mysterious knowledge called Upasana, which is of the nature of Bhakti,
together with special knowledge, namely, the distinguishing knowledge of
how it differs from other meditations. The import is this: You have
heard of My eminence, which is distinct in kind from all other forms of
greatness and is unlimited in its modes. You must have been convinced
that it can be so only and not otherwise. To you whose mind is thus
prepared, I shall declare that knowledge by aciring which, and making
which your way of life, you will be emancipated from all evil that
hinders you from attaining Me.
