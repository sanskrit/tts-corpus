9.10 Therefore, My Prakrti, looked at by Me, through My will and under
My supervision creates the world with its mobile and immobile beings in
accordance with the Karma of individual selves. Because of this, namely,
My look at Prakrti in conformity with the Karma of individual selves,
the world revolves. Behold in this wonderful phenomena the lordly power
inherent to Me, the son of Vasudeva, such as My sovereignty, true
resolve and being devoid of cruelty and similar blemishes! So declare
the Srutis: 'The possessor of Maya projects this universe out of this.
The other (i.e., individual self) is confined by Maya in the world. One
should know the Maya to be the Prakrti. And the possessor of Maya to be
the Mighty Lord' (Sve. U., 4.9.10).
