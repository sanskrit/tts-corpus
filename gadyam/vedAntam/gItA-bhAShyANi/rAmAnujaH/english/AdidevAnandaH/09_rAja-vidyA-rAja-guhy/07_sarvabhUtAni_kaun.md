9.7 All the mobile and immobile entities enter into My Prakrti at the
end of a cycle, namely at the end of Brahma's life in accordance with My
will. This Prakrti, constituting My body, is designated by the term
Tamas, as it cannot be differentiated into name and form. I again send
forth the very same beings at the beginning of a cycle. Manu declares
accordingly: 'This universe became Tamas ৷৷. by an act of will. He
produced it out of His body' (Manu, 1.5.8). The Srutis also declare
thus: 'He whose body is Avyakta' (Su. U., 7); 'The Avyakta merges into
Aksara, the Aksara into Tamas' (Ibid., 2); and also 'There was Tamas;
the intelligence was concealed by Tamas' (Tai. Br., 1.8.9).
