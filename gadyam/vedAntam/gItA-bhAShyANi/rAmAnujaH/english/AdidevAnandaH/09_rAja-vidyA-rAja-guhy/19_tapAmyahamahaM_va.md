9.19 I send out 'heat' in the form of fire, the sun etc. I 'hold back'
the rain during summer. Likewise, I pour out the rains during the rainy
season. I am 'immortality as well as death' - I am both these conditions
through which the world lives and dies. Why say more; I am 'the being
and the non-being.' Being is that which exists in the present time.
Non-being is that which existed in the past and that which may exist in
the future, but is not experienced now as existing. The meaning is that,
I alone am existent, having all the entities for my modes, as all
intelligent and inhert beings existing in all states, constitute My
body. In this way, they (the wise) worship Me, contemplating, through
the realisation of My essential unity, as the entire universe
distinguished by names and forms and characterished by varied
pluralities constituting My body. I alone exist; all the pluralities are
only My modes. Thus, after depiciting the character of the noble-minded,
whose enjoyment consists of only the experience of the Lord, and in
order to bring into bolder relief their greatness, He describes the
behaviour of ignorant men who covet the objects of desire.
