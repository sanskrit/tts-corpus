9.22 There are Mahatmas who, excluding everything else and having no
other purpose, meditate on Me as their only purpose, because without Me
they are unable to sustain themselves. They think of Me and worship Me
with all my auspicious attributes and with all my glories. In the case
of such devotees aspiring after eternal union with Me, I Myself
undertake the responsibility of bringing them to Myself (Yoga translated
as 'prosperity') and of preserving them in that state for ever (Ksema
translated as 'welfare'). The meaning is that they do not return to
Samsara.
