9.13 Those who, through their multitude of good acts, have taken refuge
in Me and have been thery released from the bondage of evil - they
understand My divine nature. They are high-souled. Knowing Me to be the
immutable source of all beings, namely, as the Lord whose name, acts and
nature are beyond thought and speech, and who has descended in a human
form out of supreme compassion to rescue the good, - they worship Me
with un unswerving mind. As I am extremely dear to them, without
worshipping Me they are unable to find support for their mind, self and
external organs. Thus they become devoted to Me as their sole object.
