9.15 Other high-minded persons worship Me by singing My names, etc.,
already described; and they also perform the sacrifice called knowledge.
They worship Me, who, by being 'characterised by diversity in various
ways' in the form of the cosmos, is a multiform, namely, having all
entities as modes (Prakaras) and also as One (the Prakari). The purport
is this: The Lord Vasudeva alone, having the body comprising animate and
inanimate entities in an extremely subtle form (in the state of Cosmic
dissolution) incapable of distinctness by name and form, resolves by His
unfailing true will power: 'May I become embodied in gross animate and
inanimate entities, distinguished variously by name and form.' He alone
then abides, with the variegated cosmos as His body, comprising gods,
animals, men and immobile things. They worship Me by contemplating on Me
thus. Therefore Sri Krsna declares: 'I, having the universe for My body,
alone abide'.
