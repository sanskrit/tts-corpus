9.18 'Gaith' means that which is reached. The meaning is that it is the
place to be reached from everywhere. The 'supporter' is one who props.
The 'ruler' is one who rules. The 'witness' is one who sees directly.
The 'abode' is that where one dwells in as in a house etc. The 'refuge'
is the intelligent being wh has to be sought, as he leads one to the
attainment of desirable things and avoidance of evils. A 'friend' is one
who wishes well. The 'base' is that place in which origin and
dissolution takes place. I alone am that 'Nidhana', that which is
preserved. What comes into being and is dissolved is Myself. The
imperishable seed is that exhaustless cause everywhere. I alone am that.
