9.31 Quickly he becomes righteous, the Gunas of Rajas and Tamas in him
being eradicated with their roots, as he has shaken off all evils
through the worship of Myself without any ulterior motive but only
because of My being dear to him. Quickly he becomes one whose mind is
specially attuned to My worship with all the ancillaries and having all
the obstacles removed. It is this kind of worship which was alluded to
by the term. Dharma at the commencement of this chapter thus:
'Asraddhadanah purusa dharmasy'asya' etc., (9.3). Such a person obtains
enduring peace, i.e., he attains to an eternal state, free from conduct
contrary to the attainment of Myself, and from which there will be no
return to Samsara. O Arjuna, you may affirm that one who has begun to
worship Me in this way will not perish even though he is tarnished by
some misconduct in the past. On account of his devotion to Me, he
annihilates the entire host of obstacles. After obtaining eternal state
of freedom from obstacles, he ickly obtains perfect Bhakti.
