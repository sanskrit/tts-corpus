9.25 The term 'Vrata' in the text denotes will, intention or motive.
Those who intend to worship gods, like Indra and others with the
resolution, 'Let us worship Indra and other gods by ceremonies like the
new moon and full moon sacrifices' - such worshippers go to Indra and
other gods. Those who intend worshipping manes, resolving 'Let us
worship the manes through sacrifices,' - such worshippers go to the
manes or others resolving - 'Let us worship the Yaksas, Raksasas,'
Pisacas and other evil spirits' - they go to them. But those who, with
the same rites of worship, worship Me with the intention, 'Let us
worship Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Self, whose body is constituted of
gods, the manes and the evil spirits' - they are My worshippers and they
reach Me only. Those who intend worshipping gods etc., attain gods etc.
After sharing limited enjoyment with them, they are destroyed with them
when the time comes for their destruction. But My worshippers attain Me,
who has no beginning or end, who is omniscient, whose will is
unfailingly effective, who is a great ocean of innumerable auspicious
attributes of unlimited excellence and whose bliss too is of limitless
excellence. They do not return to Samsara. Such is the meaning. Sri
Krsna continues to say, 'There is also another distinguishing
characteristic of My worshippers.'
