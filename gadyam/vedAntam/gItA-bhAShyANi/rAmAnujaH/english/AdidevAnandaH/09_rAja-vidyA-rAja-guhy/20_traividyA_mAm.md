9.20 The three Vedas consist of the Rk, Yajus and Saman. The followers
of the three Vedas are called 'Trai-vidyah', but they are not devoted to
Vedanta (or Trayyanta). The great souls, who rely on Vedanta, know Me,
as mentioned before, to be the only object to be known from all the
Vedas. Considering Me as the highest object of attainment, they worship
Me through singing My names etc., caused by deep devotion to Me, and
also through the sacrifice of knowledge. But the followers of the three
Vedas drink the Soma beverage, forming the remainder of sacrifices in
honour of Indra and other divinities, as prescribed by the Vedas. They
are thery purified of evil that stand in the way of attainment of
heaven. In these sacrifices, in which Indra etc., are regarded as
divinties, they really worship Me in the forms of these divinities. They
'however' do not know that I abide in them in that way, and so they pray
for the way to heaven etc. After attaining the world of Indra, which is
free from unhappiness, they enjoy everywhere the divine pleasures.
