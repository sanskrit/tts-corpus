9.17 Of the world consisting of mobile and immobile entities, I alone am
the father, mother, creator and grandfather. Here the term Dhatr stands
for one other than the parents who helps in the birth of a particular
person. Whatever is known from theVedas as purifying, I alone am that. I
am the Pranava, which originates knowledge and forms the seed of the
Vedas. I am the Veda comprising Rk, Saman and Yajus.
