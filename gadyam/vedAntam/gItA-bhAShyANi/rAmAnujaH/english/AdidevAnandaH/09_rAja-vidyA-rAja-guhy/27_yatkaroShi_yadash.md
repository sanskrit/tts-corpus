9.27 Whatsoever worldly work you do for the sustenance of the body,
whatsoever you set aside for the sustenance of the body, whatsoever
Vedic acts, obligatory and occasional, like offerings, charity and
austerity you practise - do all that as an offering to Me. 'Arpana' is
offering. Do all acts, secular and Vedic, as if the doer, the enjoyer
and the worshipped were all offerings to Me. The import is this: The
divinities etc., who are the objects of sacrificial worship, charities
etc., and you, the agent and experiencer - all belong to Me and have
their essence, existence and actions dependent on Me. Thus only to Me,
the supreme Principal (Sesi) and supreme agent, offer everything -
yourself as the agent, experiencer and worshipper, all the host of
divinities who are the object of worship and the sum of actions
constituting the worship. Actuated by overwhelming love, contemplate
yourself and other factors such as the objects of worship, as dependent
on Me as My Sesas, and hence as of a nature that finds delight only in
subservience to Me.
