9.14 Because of My being very dear to them, they are unable to find
support for their souls even for a moment without 'singing My praises,'
'striving for My sake and bowing to Me in reverence.' Remembering My
names connotative of My special attributes, they cry out My names -
Narayana, Krsna, Vasudeva etc., with horripilations in every part of
their bodies and with their voices tremulous and indistinct because of
joy. They engage in activities for my sake, such as performing worship,
and doing actions helpful to worship, lik building temples and
cultivating temple gardens. They prostrate themselves on the earth like
a stick, indifferent to dust, mud and the gravel, with all the eight
members of their beings - the Manas, Buddhi, Ahankara, the two feet, two
hands, and the head, which are bowed down under the influence of Bhakti.
Aspiring for eternal communion with Me, desiring eternal union with Me,
they worship Me, resolved to attain the state of servitude to Me for
their entire being.
