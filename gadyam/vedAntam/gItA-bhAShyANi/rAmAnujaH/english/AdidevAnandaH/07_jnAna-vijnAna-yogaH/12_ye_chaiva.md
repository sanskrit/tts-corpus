7.12 Why should this be declared with particular illustrations; The
reason is as follows: Whatever entities exist in the world partaking of
the alities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas in the forms of bodies, senses,
objects of enjoyment and their causes - know them all to have originated
from Me alone, and they abide in Me alone, as they constitute My body.
'But I am not in them.' That is, I do not depend for My existence on
them at any time. In the case of other beings, though the body depends
for its existence on the self, the body serves some purpose of the self
in the matter of Its sustenance. To Me, however, there is no purpose at
all of that kind served by them constituting My body. The meaning is
that they merely serve the purpose of My sport.
