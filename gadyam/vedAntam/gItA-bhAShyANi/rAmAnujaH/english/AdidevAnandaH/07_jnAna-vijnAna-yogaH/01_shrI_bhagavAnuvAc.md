7.1 The Lord said Listen attentively to My words imparting knowledge to
you, by which you will understand Me indubitably and fully - Me, the
object of the Yogic contemplation in which you are engaged with a mind
so deeply bound to Me by virtue of overwhelming love that it would
disintegrate instantaneously the moment it is out of touch with My
essential nature, attributes, deeds and glories, and with your very self
resting so completely on Me that it would break up when bereft of Me.
