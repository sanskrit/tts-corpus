7.25 Concealed by the Maya called Yogamaya, I am associated with a human
form and other generic structures which are special to individual
selves. Because of this I am not manifest to all. The foolish, by seeing
in Me merely the human or the other generic structures, do not know that
My powers are greater than those of Vayu and Indra, that My lustre is
more brilliant than that of sun and fire, that though visible to all, I
am unborn, immutable, the cause of all the worlds, the Lord of all, and
that I have assumed a human form, so that all who want can take refuge
in Me.
