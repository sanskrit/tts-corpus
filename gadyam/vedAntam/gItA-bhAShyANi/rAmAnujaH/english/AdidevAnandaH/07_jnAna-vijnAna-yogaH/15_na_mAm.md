7.15 'Evil-doers', those who commit evil deeds, do not resort to Me.
They are of four types, according to the degree of their evil deeds: (i)
the foolish, (ii) the lowest of men, (iii) those persons deprived of
knowledge by Maya, and (iv) those given to demoniac nature. 'The
foolish' are those who have misconceived knowledge. True knowledge
consists in understanding that the self is dependent on the Lord and
exists for Him. But 'the foolish' think they are independent and also
that all enjoyable things of the world are their own and for their
enjoyment. 'The lowest of men' are those who are incapable of turning
towards Me, even though My essential nature is known to them generally.
'Persons who are deprived of knowledge by Maya' are those who, though
possessing knowledge about Me and My manifestations, are moved by
deceitful reasonings to contend that such knowledge is inconsistent and
impossible. 'Those of demoniac nature' are those who have positive
knowledge about Myself and My manifestation but hate Me. The intensity
of sinfulness in these types in the order in which they are successively
placed.
