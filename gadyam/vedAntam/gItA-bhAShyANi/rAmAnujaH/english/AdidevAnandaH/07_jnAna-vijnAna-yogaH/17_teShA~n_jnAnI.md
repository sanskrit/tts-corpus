7.17 Of these four, 'the man of knowledge' is the foremost. Why; Because
of being ever with Me in Yoga and devoted to the One only. To the man of
knowledge the attainment of Myself being the only end in view, he is
ever with Me. As for the others, they contemplate on Me only until the
fulfilment of their desires. But to the man of knowledge, there is
single-minded devotion to Me only. Unlike him, the others, want only the
objects of their desire and they are devoted to Me only as a means for
gaining them. Hence he, the man of knowledge, alone is the foremost.
Further I am very dear to the man of knowledge. Here the term 'artha' in
relation to the expression 'athyartham' denotes 'what cannot be
expressed adeately.' That is, even I, the omniscient and omnipotent, is
unable to express how much I am dear to the Jnanin, since there is no
such limit as 'this much' for this love. Such is the meaning. As in the
case of Prahlada, the foremost among men of knowledge, it is said: 'But
he with his thoughts firmly fixed on Krsna while being bitten by the
great serpents, felt no pain from the wounds, being immersed in
rapturous recollections of Him' (V. P., 1.17.39). I reciprocate this
love infinitely.
