7.5 This is My lower Prakrti. But know My higher Prakrti which is
different from this, i.e., whose nature is different from this inanimate
Prakrti constituting the objects of enjoyment to animate beings. It is
'higher', i.e., is more pre-eminent compared to the lower Prakrti which
is constituted only of inanimate substances. This higher Nature of Mine
is the individual self. Know this as My higher Prakrti through which the
whole inanimate universe is sustained.
