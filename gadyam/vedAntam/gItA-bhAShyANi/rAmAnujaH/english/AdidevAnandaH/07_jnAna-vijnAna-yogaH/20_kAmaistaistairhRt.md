7.20 All men of this world are 'controlled', i.e., constantly
accompanied by their own nature consisting in the Vasanas (subtle
impressions) resulting from relation with the objects formed of the
Gunas. Their knowledge about My essential nature is robbed by various
Karmas, i.e., by objects of desire corresponding to their Vasanas
(subtle impressions) born of their Karmas and constituted of Gunas. In
order to fulfil these various kinds of desires they take refuge in,
i.e., seek and worship, other divinities who are regarded as different
from Me, such as Indra and others, observing various disciplines, i.e.,
practising rituals which are specially meant to propitiate only these
divinities.
