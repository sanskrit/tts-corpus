like: 'He who, dwelling in the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose

with faith whatever form of Mine, such as the Indra, although not
knowing these divinities to be My forms, I consider his faith as being
directed to My bodies or manifestations, and make his faith steadfast,
i.e., make it free from obstacles.
