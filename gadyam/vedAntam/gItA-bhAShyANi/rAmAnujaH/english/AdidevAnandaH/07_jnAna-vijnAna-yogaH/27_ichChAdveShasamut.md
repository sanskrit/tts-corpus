7.27 As soon as beings are born they are deluded. This delusion springs
from sense experiences described as pairs of opposites like heat and
cold. Such reactions spring from desire and hate. The purport is this:
Desire and hatred for the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain,
which are constituted of Gunas, have their origin in the Jivas from the
past experiences they had in their previous births. The subtle
impressions or Vasanas of these previous experiences manifest again as
instinctive desire and hatred towards similar objects in every
succeeding birth of the Jivas. The delusive force of these impressions
make them deluded from the very beginning. It becomes their nature to
have love or hatred for such objects, in place of having happiness and
misery at union with or separation from Me. The Jnanin, however, feels
happiness when he is in union with Me and misery when separated from Me.
No other being is born with such a nature as found in the Jnanin.
