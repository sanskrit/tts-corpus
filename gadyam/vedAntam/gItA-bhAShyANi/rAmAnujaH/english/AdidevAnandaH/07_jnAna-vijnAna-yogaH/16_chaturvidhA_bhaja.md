7.16 'Men of good deeds,' i.e., those who have meritorious Karmas to
their credit, and who resort to Me and worship Me alone - they too are
divided into four types according to the degrees of their good deeds,
each subseent type being better than the preceding, because of the
greatness of their good deeds and gradation in respect of their
knowledge. (i) The 'distressed' is one who has lost his position in life
and his wealth, and who wishes to regain them (ii) He who 'aspires for
wealth' is one who desires for wealth which he has not till then
attained. Between them the difference is very little, as both of them
seek wealth. (iii) He 'who seeks after knowledge' is one who wishes to
realise the real nature of the self (in Its pure state) as an entity
different from the Prakrti. He is called 'one who seeks to secure
knowledge,' because knowledge alone is the essential nature of the self.
(iv) And the 'man of knowledge' is he who knows that, it is the
essential nature of the self to find happiness only as the Sesa
(subsidiary or liege) of the Lord, as taught in the text beginning with,
'But know that which is other than this (lower nature) to be the higher
Prakrti' (7.5). Without stopping with the knowledge of the self as
different from the Prakrti, he desires to attain the Lord. He thinks
that the Lord alone is the highest aim to reach.
