7.6 Know that all beings from Brahma down to a tuft of grass, who have
their origin in these two Prakrtis of Mine, are aggregated forms of the
self and of inanimate matter. Irrespective of whether they are existing
in a superior or inferior form, the selves and inanimate matter are
mixed together in them. On account of their origination in My two
Prakrtis, they are Mine. So, know that because the entire universe has
its origination in these two Prakrtis which have their origination in
Me, I am myself the origin and dissolution of the entire universe. For
the same reason, I am its Lord (Sesin). It is proved on the basis of the
Srutis and Smrtis that these two, Prakrti and Purusa (matter and the
self), which form the aggregate of all animate and inanimate beings,
have the Supreme Person as their cause. This is evident from Sruti and
Smrti texts like the following: 'The Mahat resolves into Avyakta,
Avyakta into Aksara, Aksara into Tamas, and Tamas becomes one with the
Supreme Lord' (Su. U., 2); 'O sage, distinct from the form of Visnu, the
Supreme Lord, the two forms, Prakrti and Purusa, arise' (V. P., 1.2.24);
and 'What was described by Me as Prakrti in its dual form of the
manifest and the unmanifest, and the Purusa do merge in the Supreme
Self, and the Supreme Self is the support of all. He is the Supreme Lord
named Visnu, exalted in the Vedas and Vedanta' (V. P., 6.4.38-39).
