7.18 Because they worship Me alone, all these are generous i.e.,
benefactors. For, those who receive from Me anything, however small they
are, I consider them as contributing everything to Me (and thus as
benefactors). But I deem the man of knowledge to be My very self. I
consider Myself as depending on him for My support. Why is it so;
Because this person considers Me to be the highest and finds it
impossible to support himself without Me; I also find it impossible to
be without him. Thus, verily, he is My self. The attainment of this
state of mind reires innumerable auspicious births. It is attained after
gaining the knowledge of the real nature of the self and the self feels
that Its happiness consists in being a dependant (Sesa) of Myself.
