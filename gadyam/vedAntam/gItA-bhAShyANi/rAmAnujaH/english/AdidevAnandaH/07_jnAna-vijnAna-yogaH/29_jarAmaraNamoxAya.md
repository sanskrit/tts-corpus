7.29 Those who take refuge in Me and strive for deliverance from old age
and death, i.e., for the vision of the real nature of the self as
distinct from the Prakrti, they know brahman (the pure individual self).
They also know all about the individual self, and the whole of Karma.
\[This attainment is known as Kaivalya, which means the aloofness of the
self in absorption in Its own bliss.\]
