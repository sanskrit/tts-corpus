7.23 The men of 'small understanding' means those whose understanding is
poor, who worship only Indra and other divinities. The fruit of their
worship is small and finite. Why; The worshippers of divinities like
Indra go to the divinities. And Indra and other divinities possess
limited joy and live only for a limited time. So if they attain eality
of enjoyment with them, they also fall down along with them in due
course; but My devotees, knowing that their acts are of the nature of My
worship, renouncing attachment for finite, fruits, reach Me, having for
their purpose the pleasing of Me alone. That is, they never more return
to Samsara. For Sri Krsna teaches later on: 'But on reaching Me there is
no rirth, O Arjuna' (8.16). Now Sri Krsna declares: 'But these others
(i.e., who worship Indra etc.) regard as insignificant even My
incarnations among men and other beings in order to make Myself easy for
all to resort to.'
