7.3 'Men', i.e., those who are alified for observing the ;nds of the
Sastras - among thousands of such men, only some one strives till the
attainment of perfection. Among thousands who strive till the attainment
of perfection, some one only, understanding Me, strives to attain
success through Me (i.e., through My grace). Among thousands of those
who might know Me, some one only knows Me in reality, as I am. In other
words, there is no one who is capable of knowing Me as I am, i.e., as
distinguished from all other entities, as implied in the expression
Vijnana. Sri Krsna will declare later on: 'It is very hard to find such
a great-souled person' (7.19), and 'But no one knows Me' (7.26).
