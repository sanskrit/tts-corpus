17.2 The Lord said 'Threefold is the faith among all' embodied beings.
And it arises from their 'inborn nature.' What is called Svabhava is the
state unie to one's own nature. It is the special taste or predilection
caused by previous subtle impressions, 'Vasanas.' To whatever one's
predilection is directed, there faith is born in respect of it. For
'faith' is zeal or eagerness about any means in the belief that it is
the way of action to achieve one's own desired object. Vasana (subtle
impression), Ruci (taste) and Sraddha (faith) are the alities of the
self born from its association with the Gunas. The Sattva and the other
Gunas are the alities of the body, the senses, the internal organs and
sense-objects. They bring about their alities in the self associated
with them. These are the Vasanas. These Gunas can be described only by
their effects. These (i.e., Vasanas etc.) originate from experiences
with the body etc., having origination in Sattva and other Gunas. Thus
faith is threefold as marked by Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Listen about
this faith.
