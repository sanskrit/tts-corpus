17.18 'Respect' means recognition by others. 'Praise' means verbal
adulation. 'Reverence' means corporeal actions such as prostration etc.
That austerity, practised with expectation of rewards like respect,
etc., mentioned above - it is here said to be Rajasa. It is unsteady and
impermanent, because of the temporary nature of its rewards like heaven
etc.; 'unsteadiness' is the result of the fear of falling. 'Impermanent'
means the tendency to perish.
