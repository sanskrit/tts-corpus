17.5 - 17.6 'Those men who perform terrible pernances not enjoined by
the Sastras' - this is illustrative of sacrifices etc., of a similar
nature. Those who perform sacrifices, etc., sacrifices which are not
enjoined by the Sastras and demand much exertion, those who are
possessed of 'ostentation and conceit and are goaded by sensual desire,
attachment and passion' - they torture the group of elements such as
earth etc., in their bodies. They also torture the individual self which
is a part of Myself and is within their bodies. Those who perform such
sacrifices etc., know them to be demoniacal in their resolves. The
resolve of demons is demoniac resolve. The demons are those who act
contrary to My ;ndments. Since they act contrary to My ;ndments, they do
not have even a iota of joy, but as stated earlier, they fall a prey to
a multitude of calamities. 'They fall into a foul Naraka' (16.16). Now,
Sri Krsna, resuming the subject, details the differences according to
the Gunas with reference to sacrifice, etc., enjoined by the Sastras. To
begin with, he describes three kinds of food, since the growth of Sattva
etc., has its source in food, as Srutis declare thus: 'For my dear, the
mind consists of food' (Cha. U., 6.5.4) and 'when the food is pure, the
man becomes pure' (Cha. U., 7.26.2).
