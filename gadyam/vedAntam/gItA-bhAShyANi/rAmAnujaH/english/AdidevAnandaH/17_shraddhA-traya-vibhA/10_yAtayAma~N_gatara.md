17.10 Stale (Yatayamam) means that food which has lost its original
state, being kept for a long time. Tasteless (Gatarasam) means that
which has lost its natural taste. Putrid (Puti) means emitting a bad
smell. Decayed (Paryusitam) means aciring a rancidity by lapse of time.
Refuse (Ucchistam) means the food that has remained over after being
partaken by persons other than Gurus, etc. Unclean (Amedhyam) is that
which is not fit for offering in sacrifice or worship. The meaning is
that, being unfit for offering in worship, they cannot become the
sacrificial remainder. Foods of this kind which promote the growth of
Tamas are dear to those who are characterised by Tamas. Food (Bhojana)
means that which is eaten. Tamasik food promotes further increase of
Tamas. Hence, those persons who care for their own welfare by the growth
of Sattva, should eat food charaterised by Sattva.
