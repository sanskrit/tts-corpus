17.4 'Those who have abundance of Sattva ality and are conjoined with
Sattvika faith worship the gods. The meaning is this: The faith in the
worship (sacrifice) of the gods which causes supreme joy unmixed with
pain is of Sattvika nature. The Rajasika types worship Yaksas and
Raksasas. And the others, i.e., the Tamasika types, worship the departed
ancestors and hosts of Bhutas. The faith born of Rajas brings about
limited joy mixed with pain, while the faith born of Tamas gives rise to
extremely limited joy which verges almost on pain. Therefore, there is
difference in fruits according to the Gunas regarding sacrifices etc.,
which are enjoined in the Sastras and associated with faith. However, no
happiness whatsoever will result from penances, sacrifices etc., not
enjoined in the Sastras and therefore antagonistic to My ;ndment. On the
contrary, calamity results from them. Sri Krsna proceeds to explain this
more fully.
