17.8 To a man endowed with Sattva, foods preponderating in Sattva become
dear. The foods preponderating in Sattva promote longevity. Again they
promote intellectual alertness. 'Sattva', means internal organ, viz.,
knowledge which is the effect of the internal organ is here meant by the
term Sattva. For the Sattva is the cause of growth of knowledge, as
declared in: 'From Sattva arises knowledge' (14.17). Even as the food
preponderant in Sattva is the cause of the growth of knowledge,
likewise, they promote strength and health; they also promote pleasure
and happiness. As the time of assimilation they, by themselves, promote
happiness, viz, by the performance of actions which cause happiness.
They are sweet, viz., abundant in sweet juices. They are mixed with oil,
viz., wholly oily. They are substantial, viz., they originate
substantial effects. They are agreeable viz., they appear to the eye in
beautiful forms. Food of this kind, full of Sattva-guna, is dear to the
person characterised by Sattva.
