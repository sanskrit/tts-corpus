17.23 Here Brahman means the Veda. It is the secondary meaning of the
expression, especially of the ritualistic portion of the Veda. The
three-fold expression Om Tat Sat is connected with the Brahman or the
Veda. Sacrifices and similar rituals are prescribed in the Vedas. These
expressions Om Tat Sat are used in these Vedic rites. The connection of
Om is that it should be invariably used at the commencement of the
recitation of Vedic hymns. The syllable Tat and Sat indicate that these
rituals are worthy of honour. The Brahmanas are those who are to
preserve Vedic study as also the Vedas and the sacrificial rites
ordained in them. All these were created by Me in the past. Sri Krsna
elaborates in the next verses the nature of the connection of these
syllables with the Vedic rituals, beginning first with Om.
