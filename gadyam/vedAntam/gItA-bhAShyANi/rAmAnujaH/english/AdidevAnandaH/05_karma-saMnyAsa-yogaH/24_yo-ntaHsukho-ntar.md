joy within,' i.e., finds his sole joy in experiencing the self; 'who has
his pleasure within,' i.e., whose pleasure-garden is the self; and with

bliss, knowledge, sinlessness, etc.; 'whose light is within,' i.e., who
lives, directing his knowledge solely on the self - a person of such a
description is the Yogin, who 'having become the Brahman (the self),
