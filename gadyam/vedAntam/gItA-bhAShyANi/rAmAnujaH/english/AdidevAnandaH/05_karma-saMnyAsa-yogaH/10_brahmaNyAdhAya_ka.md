5.10 Here the term, Brahman denotes Prakrti. Later on Sri Krsna will
say: 'The great Brahman is My womb' (14.3). Since Prakrti abides in the
form of senses which are particular off-shoots of Prakrti, he who, as
said in the passage beginning with 'Even though he is seeing, hearing
৷৷.' (5.8), understands that all actions proceed from Brahman (Prakrti);
renounces all attachment while engaging himself in all actions,
reflecting, 'I am doing nothing.' Such a person, though existing in
contact with Prakrti, is not contaminated by sin which is the result of
the wrong identification of the Atman with Prakrti and is the cause of
bondage. Just as a lotus leaf is not wetted by water, actions do not
affect or defile a person with sin, if he is free from such
identification with the body.
