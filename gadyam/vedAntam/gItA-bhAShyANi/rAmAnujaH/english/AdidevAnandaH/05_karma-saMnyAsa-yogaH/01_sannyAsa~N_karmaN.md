5.1 Arjuna said 'You praise the renunciation of actions, i.e., Jnana
Yoga at one time, and next Karma Yoga'. This is what is objected to: In
the second chapter, you have said that Karma Yoga alone should be
practised first by an aspirant for release; and that the vision of the
self should be achieved by means of Jnana Yoga by one whose mind has its
blemishes washed away by Karma Yoga. Again, in the third and fourth
chapters, you have praised Karma Yoga or devotion to Karma as better
than Jnana Yoga even for one who has attained the stage of Jnana Yoga,
and that, as a means of attaining the self, it (Karma Yoga) is
independent of Jnana Yoga. Therefore, of these two, Jnana Yoga and Karma
Yoga - tell me precisely which by itself is superior, i.e., most
excellent, being more easy to practise, and icker to confer the vision
of the self.
