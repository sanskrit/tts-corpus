5.17 'Those whose intellects pursue It,' i.e., those who have determined
to have the vision of the self in this way; 'those whose minds think
about It,' i.e., those whose minds have the self for their aim, those
who undergo discipline for It, i.e., those who are devoted to the
practices for Its attainment; 'those who hold It as their highest
object,' i.e., those who consider It as their highest goal - such
persons, having their previous impurities cleansed by the knowledge
which is practised in this way, attain the self as taught. 'From that
state there is no return' - the state from which there is no return
means the state of the self. The meaning is that they attain the self
which rests in Its own nature.
