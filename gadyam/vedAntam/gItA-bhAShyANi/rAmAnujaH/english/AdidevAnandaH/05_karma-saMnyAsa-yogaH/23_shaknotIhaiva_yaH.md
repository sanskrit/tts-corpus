5.23 When a man is able to withstand, i.e., to control the impulses of
emotions like desire and anger by his longing for the experience of
self, he is released 'here itself from the body,' i.e., even during the
state when he is practising the means for release, he gains the capacity
for experiencing the self. But he becomes blessed by the experience and
gets immersed in the bliss of the self only after the fall of the body
(at the end of his Prarabdha or operative Karma). \[The implication is
that in this system there is no Jivan-Mukti or complete liberation even
when the body is alive. Only the state of Sthita-prajna or of 'one of
steady wisdom' can be attained by an embodied Jiva.\]
