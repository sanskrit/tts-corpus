5.2 The Lord said Even while granting that some persons are competent
for the practice of Jnana Yoga exclusively, it has to be conceded that
renunciation, i.e., Jnana Yoga, and Karma Yoga can be practised as
independent of each other in the pursuit of the highest excellence.
Still, of these two, Karma Yoga excels over the renunciation of actions,
i.e., Jnana Yoga. Sri Krsna explains why this is so.
