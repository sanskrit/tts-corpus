5.22 Those pleasures which result from the contact of sense objects with
the senses, are the wombs of pain, i.e., have pain as their ultimate
fruit 'They have a beginning and an end,' i.e., they are seen to remain
only for a brief period and the reaction that follows their cessation is
painful. He who knows what they themselves are, i.e., know themselves as
Atman, will not find pleasure in them.
