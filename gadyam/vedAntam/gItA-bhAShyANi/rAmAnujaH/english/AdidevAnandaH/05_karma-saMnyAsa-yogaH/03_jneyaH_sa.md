5.3 That Karma Yogin, who, being satisfied with the experience of the
self implied in Karma Yoga, does not desire anything different therefrom
and conseently does not hate anything, and who, because of this,
resignedly endures the pairs of opposites - he should be understood as
ever given to renunciation, i.e., even devoted to Jnana Yoga. Such a one
therefore is freed from bondage because of his being firmly devoted to
Karma Yoga which is easy to practise. The independence of Jnana Yoga and
Karma Yoga from each other as means for attainment of the self is now
declared.
