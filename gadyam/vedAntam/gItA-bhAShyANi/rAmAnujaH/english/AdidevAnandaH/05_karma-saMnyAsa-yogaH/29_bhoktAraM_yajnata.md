5.29 Knowing Me as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, as the
Supreme Lord of all the worlds, and as the Friend of every being, he
attains peace, i.e., wins happiness even while performing Karma Yoga.
'Him who is the Supreme Lord of all worlds' means 'Him who is the Lord
of all the lords of the worlds.' For the Sruti says: 'Him who is the
supreme mighty Lord of lords' (Sve. U., 6.7). The meaning is that
knowing Me as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds and the 'friend' of all
and considering Karma Yoga to be My worship, he becomes gladly engaged
in it. All beings endeavour to please a 'friend'.
