5.14 When the world of embodied selves exists in conjunction with the
Prakrti in the form of gods, animals, men, immobile things etc., the
master (Prabhu i.e., the Jiva who is the master of the body), who is not
subject to Karma and is established in Its own essential nature, does
not bring about: (i) the agency of gods, men etc. (ii) their manifold
and particular actions and (iii) their connection with the fruits in the
form of embodiment as gods etc., resulting from their actions. Who then
brings about agency etc.; It is only the tendencies that act. A tendency
(Svabhava) is subtle impressions (Vasanas) originating from Prakrti. The
meaning is that agency, etc., do not originate from the natural or
pristine condition of the self but are generated by the subtle
impressions created by misconceiving those forms of Prakrti etc., as of
the self. This is the result of the conjunction of the self with Prakrti
in the form of gods, etc., which has been generated by the flow of
previous Karmas brought about in beginningless time.
