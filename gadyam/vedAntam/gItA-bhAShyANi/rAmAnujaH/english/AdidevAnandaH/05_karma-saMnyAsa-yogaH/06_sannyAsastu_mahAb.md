5.6 Renunciation, i.e., Jnana Yoga, cannot be attained without Yoga,
i.e., Karma Yoga. A person following Yoga, i.e., following Karma Yoga,
being himself a Muni, i.e., one engaged in the contemplation of self,
after practising Karma Yoga reaches with ease the Brahman i.e., attains
the self soon, i.e., in a short time. But one following Jnana Yoga by
itself, completes Jnana Yoga with great difficulty only. On account of
this great difficulty, he attains the self after a long period only.
