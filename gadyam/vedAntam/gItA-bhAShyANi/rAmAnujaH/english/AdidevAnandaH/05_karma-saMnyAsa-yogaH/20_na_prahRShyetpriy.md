5.20 Whatever is experienced as pleasant by one staying in a body and
remaining in a particular condition because of the subtle impressions of
his old Karmas, and whatever is experienced as unpleasant - on attaining
those two types of experiences, one should not feel joy or grief. How;
By having the mind on that 'Which is steadfast' i.e., the self,
'Undeluded,' i.e., one must be free from the delusion of identity of the
steadfast self with the transient body. And how can this be; He who
knows Brahman and abides in Brahman, i.e., by becoming a knower of
Brahman by instruction by the teachers - such a person abides steadily,
engaged in the practices towards winning Brahman. What is said is this:
From the instructions received from the sages who know the truth, one
should learn what has to be learnt about the self. Endeavouring to
actualise the same, one does not consider the body as the sefl and
remains fixed in the joyous experience of the vision of the steadfast
self. Let him not rejoice and grieve when he experiences pleasant and
unpleasant things, as such experiences result from the Prakrti and are
transient.
