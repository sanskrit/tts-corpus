5.8 - 5.9 Thus he who knows the truth concerning the self should reflect
in mind that the ear and the other organs of sensation (Jnanendriyas) as
also organs of action (Karmendriyas) and the vital currents (the Pranas)
are occupied with their own respective objects. Thus he should know, 'I
do not do anything at all.' He should reflect, 'My intrinsic nature is
one of knowledge. The sense of agency comes because of the association
of the self with the senses and the Pranas which are rooted in Karma. It
does not spring from my essential nature.'
