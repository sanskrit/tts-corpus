5.25 The sages are seers who are devoted to the vision of the self. For
them the pairs of opposites are annulled; i.e., they are freed from
pairs of opposites like cold and heat, etc. 'They have their minds well
subdued,' i.e., their minds are directed to the self. 'They are devoted
to the welfare of all beings,' i.e., they are interested in the welfare
of all beings like their own selves. Those persons who are like this
have all their impurities, which are incompatible with the attainment of
the self, annulled, and they attain to the bliss of the Brahman. For
those possessing the characteristics mentioned above, Sri Krsna now
teaches that the Brahman is easy to attain.
