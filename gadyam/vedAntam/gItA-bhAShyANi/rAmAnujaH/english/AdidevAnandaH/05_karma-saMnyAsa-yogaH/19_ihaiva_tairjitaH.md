5.19 By those whose minds rest in ealness with regard to all selves in
the aforesaid manner, even here, i.e., even at the stage of executing
the means, Samsara is overcome. For the Brahman is of the same nature
everywhere when uncontaminated. The meaning is that the substance of
self, when free from the contaminations resulting from contact with the
Prakrti (body), is the same everywhere i.e., as the Brahman (the Atman).
If they are fixed in the eality of all selves, they verily abide in
Brahman. The abidance in the Brahman is verily the conest of Samsara.
Those who contemplate on the sameness of all selves, because of their
having the form of knowledge, they are liberated. Sri Krsna now teaches
that mode of life by following which the maturity of knowledge in the
form of sameness of vision comes to a Karma Yogin.
