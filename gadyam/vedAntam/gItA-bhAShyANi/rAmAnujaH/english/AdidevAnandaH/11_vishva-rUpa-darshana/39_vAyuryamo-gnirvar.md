11.39 You alone are the great-grandsire of all and also grandfather etc.
The Prajapatis are the fathers of all creatures. Hiranyagarbha (Brahma),
the father of the Prajapatis, is the grandsire of all creatures. You,
being the father of even Hiranyagarbha, are great grandfather of all
creatures. You alone are denoted by the several terms by which these
beings are known. Such is the meaning. Beholding the Lord in a most
marvellous form, Arjuna, bent with great awe, saluted Him from all sides
with his eyes widely open from joy.
