11.15 Arjuna said O Lord! I behold in Your body all gods and all classes
of living beings as also Brahma, the four-faced ruler of the cosmic egg.
So too Siva (Isa) who is seated in the lotus-seated Brahma, meaning that
Siva abides by the directions of Brahma. So also all the seers of whom
the divine seers are the foremost; and lustrous snakes like Vasuki,
Taksaka etc.
