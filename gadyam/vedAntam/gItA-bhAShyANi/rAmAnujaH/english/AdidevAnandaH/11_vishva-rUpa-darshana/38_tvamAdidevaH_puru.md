11.38 You alone are all the knowers and all that must be known. You
alone, abiding thus as the Self of all, are the 'Dhaman' (abode),
namely, the goal to be attained. By You, O infinite of form, is the
universe pervaded. By You the universe, composed of conscient beings and
non-conscient matter, is 'Tatam', pervaded. You are the Primal God, the
Ancient Person. You are the supreme resting place of the universe. The
meaning is that You are the supreme foundation of the universe which
constitutes Your body, as You are its Self. \[It is to be noted how
Ramanuja derives here the meaning of 'individual self' for the word
Aksara, which helps him to explain 'Kutasth'oksara ucchyate' in 15.16\]
Arjuna says: 'Therefore You alone are expressed by the terms Vayu etc.'
