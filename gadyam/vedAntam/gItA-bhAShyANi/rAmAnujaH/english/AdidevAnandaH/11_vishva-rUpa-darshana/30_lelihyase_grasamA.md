11.30 Devouring all these kings with Your flaming mouths, You lick them
up, namely, lick up again and again in great anger. Your lips etc., are
wet with their blood. Your fiery rays scorch the universe by the
brilliant flow of radiance filling the whole universe. You have
manifested Yourself in this terrible form for revealing Your limitless
sovereignty as reested by me thus: 'Reveal Yourself to me
completely'(11.4), so that I may realise Your limitless sovereignty.
