11.53 - 11.54 Sri Krsna says By Vedas, i.e., by mere study, teaching
etc., of these sacred texts, it is not possible to know Me truly. It is
also not possible through meditation, sacrifices, gifts and austerities,
destitute of devotion towards Me. But by single-minded devotion i.e., by
devotion characterised by extreme ardour and intensity, it is possible
to know Me in reality through scriptures, to behold Me directly in
reality, and enter into Me in reality. So describes a Sruti passage:
'This Self cannot be obtained by instruction, nor by intellect nor by
much hearing. Whomsoever He chooses, by him alone is He obtained. To
such a one He reveals His own form' (Ka. U., 2.2.23) and (Mun. U.,
3.2.3).
