11.50 Sanjaya said Having spoken thus to Arjuna, the Lord, the son of
Vasudeva, revealed His own four-armed form. And the Mahatman, i.e., one
whose resolves are always treu, reassured him who was terror-stricken on
seeing ann unfamiliar form, by resuming the familiar pleasant form.
Possession of His own four-armed form alone is proper to this Lord of
all, the Supreme Person, the Supreme Brahman, when he has assumed the
human form for blessing this world as the son of Vasudeva. But in answer
to the prayer of Vasudeva, who was terrified by Kamsa, the two extra
arms were withdrawn till the destruction of Kamsa. These became manifest
again. For He was prayed to thus: 'You are born, O Lord, O Lord of gods,
withdraw this form bearing conch, discus and mace out of grace ৷৷.
withdraw this form of four arms, O Self of all' (V. P., 5.3.10 and 13).
Even to Sisupala, who hated Him, this form of four arms of Sri Krsna was
the object of constant thought, as described in: 'Him who is of four
long and robust arms, bearing the conch, discus and the mace' (V. P.,
4.15.10). Hence Arjuna also exclaimed here; 'Assume again that
four-armed shape' (11.46).
