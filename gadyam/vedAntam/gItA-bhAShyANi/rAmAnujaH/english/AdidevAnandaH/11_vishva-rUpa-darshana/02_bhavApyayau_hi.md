11.2 Likewise, beginning from the seventh, and ending with the tenth
discourse, the origination and dissolution of all beings other than You,
as issuing from You, the Supreme Self, have been heard at length by me.
Your unlimited greatness, immutable and eternal, Your principalship
(Sesitva) over all sentient and non-sentient things, Your supreme
greatness consisting of the host of auspicious attributes like
knowledge, strength etc., Your being the supporter of all things and
actuator of all activities like thinking, blinking etc., have also been
heard. Here the term, 'hi' (verily) expresses the desire to have the
vision which is going to be revealed.
