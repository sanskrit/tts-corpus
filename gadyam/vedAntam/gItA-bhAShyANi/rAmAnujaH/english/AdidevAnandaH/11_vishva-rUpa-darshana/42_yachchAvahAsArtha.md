11.41 - 11.42 Infinite power, boundless valour, being the Inner Self of
everything, being the creator etc., these constitute Your majesty. Being
ignorant of this, and considering You only as a friend, and out of
conseent love, or negligence born of life-long familiarity, whatever has
been said rudely, without showing courtesy, such as 'O Krsna, O Yadava,
O Comrade'; and whatever disrespect has been shown to You in jest, while
playing or resting, while sitting or eating, while alone or in the sight
of others - for all these I beseech forgiveness of You who are in
incomprehensible.
