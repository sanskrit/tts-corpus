11.32 The Lord said Kala (Time) is the calculator which calculates
(Kalayati). Calculating the end of the lives of all those under the
leadership of Dhrtarastra's sons, I am causing their destruction. Fully
manifesting Myself with this fierce form, I have begun to destroy the
hosts of kings. Therefore, by My will, even without you, namely, even
without your effort, all these hostile warriors under the leadership of
Dhrtarastra's sons, shall cease to be, i.e., will be destroyed.
