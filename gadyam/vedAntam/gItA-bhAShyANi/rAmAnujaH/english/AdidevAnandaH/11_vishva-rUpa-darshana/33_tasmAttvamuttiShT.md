11.33 Therefore, arise for fighting against them. Conering your enemies,
win glory and enjoy a prosperous and righteous kingdom. All those who
have sinned have been already annihilated by Me. Be you merely an
instrument (Nimitta) of Mine in destroying them - just like a weapon in
my hand, O Savyasacin! The root 'Sac' means 'fastening'. A 'savyasacin'
is one who is capable of fixing or fastening the arrow even with his
left hand. The meaning is that he is so dexterous that he can fight with
a bow in each hand.
