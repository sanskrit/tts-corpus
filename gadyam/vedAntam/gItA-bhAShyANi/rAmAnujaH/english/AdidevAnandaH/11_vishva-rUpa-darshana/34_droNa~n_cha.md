11.34 Say Drona, Bhisma, Karna, etc., who have ben chosen for
destruction by me alone, as they have transgressed the law of
righteousness. Be not distressed, considering, 'How can I slay these
teachers, relations and others who are attached to enjoyments;' Do not
be thus distressed by thinking about the right and wrong of it, or out
of love and compassion for them. These persons are guilty of
unrighteousness by siding with the evil-minded Duryodhana. They have
been chosen by Me alone for destruction. Therefore fight without doubt.
You shall conqer your enemies in battle. In slaying them, there is not
the slighest trace of cruelty. The purport is that victory is the sure
result.
