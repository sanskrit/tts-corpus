11.47 The Lord said The 'luminous' form of Mine is a mass of luminosity.
It is 'universal' i.e., constitutes the Self of the universe. It is
'infinite', endless. This is illustrated by describing it as having no
beginning, middle or end. It is 'primeval,' namely, it constitutes the
foundation of all beings other than Myself. It has nevr been seen before
by any one other than you. Such a form is now revealed to you, who are
My devotee, by Me who am gracious, by My own Yoga, namely, by the power
of willing the truth associated with Me. Sri Krsna proceeds to say, 'It
is not possible that I can be realised as I am, through any means except
exclusive Bhakti.'
