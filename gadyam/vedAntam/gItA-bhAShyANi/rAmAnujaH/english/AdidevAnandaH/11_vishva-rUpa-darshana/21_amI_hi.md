11.21 These hosts of superior Devas beholding You as the foundation of
the universe, rejoice and move towards You. Among them, some in fear, on
seeing Your extremely terrible and wonderful form, 'extol,' namely
pronounce sentences in the form of praise, according to their knowledge.
Others, the bands of seers and Siddhas, knowers of the truth, higher and
lower, saying 'Hail,' glorify You in hymns of abounding praise which are
suitable to the Lord.
