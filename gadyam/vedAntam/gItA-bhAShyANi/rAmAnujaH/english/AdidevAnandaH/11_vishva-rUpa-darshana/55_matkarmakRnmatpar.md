11.55 Whosoever performs all acts like the study of the Vedas described
above, considering them as several modes of worship, 'he works for Me.'
He who 'looks upon Me as the highest,' namely, one to whom I alone am
the highest purpose in all his enterprises, has Me as 'the highest end.'
He who is 'devoted to me,' i.e., is greatly devoted to me and hence
unable to sustain himself without reciting My names, praising Me,
meditating upon Me, worshipping Me, saluting Me etc., he who performs
these always considering Me as the supreme end - he is My devotee. He is
'free from attachments,' as he is attached to me alone, and is therefore
unable to have attachment to any other entity. He who is without hatred
towards any being, is one who fulfils all the following conditions: his
nature is to feel pleasure or pain solely on account of his union or
separation from Me; he considers his own sins to be the cause of his
sufferings (and not the work of others); he is confirmed in his faith
that all beings are dependent on the Parama-purusa. For all these
reasons he has no hatred for any one.
