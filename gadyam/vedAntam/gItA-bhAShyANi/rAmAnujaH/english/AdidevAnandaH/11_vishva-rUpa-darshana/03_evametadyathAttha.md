11.3 O Supreme Lord, it is certain that it is even as you have described
Yourself. O Supreme Person, O ocean of compassion for your dependants!
I, however, wish to see or wish to realise directly, Your Lordly form
peculiar to you - the form as the sovereign, protector, creator,
destroyer, supporter of all, the mine of auspicious attributes, supreme
and distinct from all other entities.
