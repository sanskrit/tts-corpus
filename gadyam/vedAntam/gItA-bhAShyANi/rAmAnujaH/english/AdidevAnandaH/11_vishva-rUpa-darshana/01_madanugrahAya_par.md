11.1 Arjuna said To show favour to me, who is deluded by the
misconception that the body is the self, these words of supreme mystery
concerned with the self, i.e., which is a proper description of the
self, have been spoken by You in words beginning from 'There was never a
time when I did not exist' (2.12) and ending with, 'Therefore, O Arjuna,
become a Yogin' (6.46). By that this delusion of mine about the self is
entirely removed.
