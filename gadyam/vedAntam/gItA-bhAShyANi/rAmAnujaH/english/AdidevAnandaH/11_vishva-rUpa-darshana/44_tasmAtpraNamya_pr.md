11.44 Therefore, bowing down and prostrating, I implore You, O adorable
Lord, for Your mercy. Just as, when entreated with salutation, a father
will show mercy to his son, or a friend to a friend, even if he has been
at fault, even so it is meet that You, most compassionate and dear to
me, should bear with me, who is dear to You in all respects.
