11.18 You alone are the Supreme 'Imperishable Person' indicated as that
which ought to be realised in such Upanisadic passages as: 'Two sciences
are to be known' (Mun. U., 1.1.4). You alone are the 'Supreme
Substratum' of the universe, i.e., supreme support of this universe. You
are 'immutable', namely, not liable to mutation. Whatever might be your
attributes and divine manifestations, You remain unchanged in Your form.
You alone are the guardian of 'the eternal law' - You who protect the
eternal Dharma of the Veda by incarnations like this. I know you are the
everlasting Person. I know You are the eternal Person, described in such
passages as, 'I know this great Purusa' (Tai. A., 3.12.7) and 'Person
who is higher than the high' (Mun. U., 3.2.8). You, who were till now
known to me as the most distinguished of the race of Yadu, have been
realised by me now through direct perception as of this nature, i.e., of
a nature unknown to me before. Such is the meaning.
