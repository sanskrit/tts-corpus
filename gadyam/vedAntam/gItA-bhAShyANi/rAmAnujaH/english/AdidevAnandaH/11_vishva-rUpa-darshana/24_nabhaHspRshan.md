11.24 The term 'Nabhas' denotes the Supreme Heaven (Parama-Vyoman),
which is beyond the Prakrti composed of the three Gunas as established
by the Sruti passages such as: 'That is in the Imperishable Supreme
Heaven' (Ma. Na. U., 1.2), 'Him, sun-coloured and beyond Tamas' (Sve.,
3.8) 'The dweller beyond the Rajas' (Rg. S., 2.6.25.5) and 'He who is
the president in the Supreme Heaven' (Rg. S., 8.9.17.7). This can be
understood as implied in the statement that 'the form touches the
Supreme Heaven.' It expresses the idea that it is the foundation of all
- of the principle of the Prakrti with its conditions, and of the
individual selves in all states. It has also been initially declared:
'For by You alone are pervaded the interspace of heaven and earth ৷৷.'
(11.20). 'Beholding Your form shining, multicoloured, and with yawning
mouths and large and resplendent eyes, my inner being trembles in fear.
I am unable to find support, namely, I am unable to find support for the
body. I am unable to get peace of mind and of the senses. O Visnu,
namely, O Pervader, beholding You pervading everything, incomparable in
magnitude, extremely wonderful and terrible, I find my limbs ivering and
my senses agitated.' Such is the meaning.
