11.43 O Being of matchless greatness! You are the father of this world,
of all that moves and does not move. You are the teacher of this world.
Therefore You are the one most worthy of reverence in this world of
mobile and immobile entities. There is none eal to You. How then could
there be in the three worlds another greater than You; No other being is
eal to You in point of any attribute like compassion etc. How could
there be any one greater; Inasmuch as You are the father of all, the
most worthy of reverence, teacher and exalted over all by virtue of
attributes like compassion etc.,
