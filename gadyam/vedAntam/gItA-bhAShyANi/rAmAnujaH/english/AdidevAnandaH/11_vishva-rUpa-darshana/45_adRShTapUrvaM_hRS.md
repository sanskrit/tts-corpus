11.45 Seeing Your form, never seen before, extremely marvellous and
awe-inspiring, I am delighted, transported with love. But my mind is
also troubled with awe. Hence reveal to me only Your most gracious form.
Be gracious, O Lord of all gods! O Abode of the universe! Show me that
form, O gracious Lord of all the gods headed by Brahma, and the
foundation of the entire universe!
