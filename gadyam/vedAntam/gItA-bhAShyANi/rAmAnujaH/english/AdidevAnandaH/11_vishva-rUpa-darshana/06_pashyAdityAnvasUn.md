11.6 Behold in My single form (i.e., the many forms in the one form
revealed to Arjuna), the twelve Adityas, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, the
two Asvins and forty-nine Maruts. This is just illustrative. Behold all
those things directly perceived in this world and those described in the
Sastras, and also many marvels, not seen before in all the worlds and in
all the Sastras.
