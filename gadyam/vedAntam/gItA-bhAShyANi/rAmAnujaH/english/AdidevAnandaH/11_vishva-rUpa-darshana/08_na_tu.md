11.8 I shall reveal to you the whole universe in one part of my body.
But, with your physical eye, which can see only limited and conditioned
things, you cannot behold Me, such as I am, different in kind from
everything else and illimitable. So I bestow on you, a divine, namely,
supernatural, eye by which you may perceive Me. Behold My Lordly Yoga'
(sovereign endowment)! Behold My unie Yoga (special power)! The meaning
is, 'Behold My Yoga such as infinite knowledge and such other attributes
and endless manifestations of lordly power!'
