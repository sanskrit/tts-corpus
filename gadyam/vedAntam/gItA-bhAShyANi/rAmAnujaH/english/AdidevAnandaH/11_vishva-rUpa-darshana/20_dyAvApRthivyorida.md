11.20 The terms, 'heaven and earth,' imply all the upper and lower
worlds. The 'Antara', or that between heaven and earth, denotes the
space between them in which are located all the worlds. You alone
pervade all the space and all the arters. 'Beholding Your marvellous and
teriible form,' beholding Your form of infinite length and extent,
marvellous and terrible, the three worlds are trembling. Gods headed by
Brahma, the Asuras, the manes, the Siddhas, the Gandharvas, the Yaksas,
and Raksasas have come with a desire to see the battle. All the 'three
worlds' consisting of these friendly, antagonistic and neutral beings
are extremely frightened. 'Mahatman' means one, the dimension of whose
mind has no limits. It has to be understood that like Arjuna, other
beings also were granted by the Lord the divine eye capable of directly
perceiving the Form which supports the universe. If it be asked why, the
reply is that it was for demonstrating to Arjuna His sovereignty. Hence
it is stated here: 'Beholding Your marvellous and terrible form, O
Mahatman, the three worlds are greatly overwhelmed with fear.'
