title = "36 असंयतात्मना योगो"

6.36 Yoga is hard to attain even in spite of great efforts by one of
unrestrained self, i.e., of unrestrained mind. But the same Yoga which
is of the form of sameness of vision can be attained by proper means by
one who is striving, whose 'mind is subdued,' i.e., by one whose mind is
conered by works (Karma Yoga) taught before, which is of the nature of
My worship and which includes within itself knowledge (Jnana). Then
Arjuna puts estions in order to hear the greatness of Yoga, as it really
is, which he has already heard about at the beginning of the teaching,
'Here there is no loss of effort' (2.40). There the greatness of Karma
Yoga as inclusive of knowledge of the self with Yoga as its culmination
was taught. This alone is the real greatness of Yoga.
