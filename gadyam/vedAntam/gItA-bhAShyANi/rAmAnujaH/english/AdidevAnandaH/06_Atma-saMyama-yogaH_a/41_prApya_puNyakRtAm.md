6.41 This person, who had wandered away from Yoga because of desire for
whatever kind of enjoyments, he will gain those very enjoyments through
the excellence of Yoga alone. Having attained to the worlds of those who
do meritorious acts, he will dwell there for a long time, i.e., till his
desire for such enjoyments gets exhausted. Then, devoid of desire for
these enjoyment, this person who has swerved from Yoga at the very
beginning of Yoga, is born, by virtue of the excellence of Yoga, in a
family of those who are competent to practise Yoga.
