6.2 Know Karma Yoga only to be that which they call as Sannyasa i.e., as
Jnana Yoga or knowledge of the real nature of the self. Sri Krsna
substantiates this by the words, 'For no one whose delusive
identification of the body with the self is not abandoned, becomes a
true Karma Yogin.' 'One whose delusion is abandoned is one by whom the
delusion of identifying the self with Prakrti (body), which is in
reality distinct from the self, is not rejected by the contemplation of
the real nature of the self. One who is not of this kind is one whose
delusion is not abandoned. One who is not of this kind cannot become a
Karma Yogin of the type described here. It has already been said: 'He
whose every undertaking is free from desire for fruits and delusive
identification of the body with the self ৷৷.' (4.19). Sri Krsna now
teaches that by Karma Yoga alone one succeeds in Yoga without the risk
of fall.
