6.10 The Yogin who is steady in the practice of Karma Yoga, should
'constantly', i.e., daily when practising Yoga, fix his mind to the
practice of Yoga, i.e., make himself engaged in the vision of the self.
He must remain in a 'solitary place,' i.e., a place devoid of crowd and
noise. And even there he must be 'all alone,' i.e., must not have a
second person with him. He should 'control his thought and mind,' i.e.,
he should control the activities of thinking. He must be free from
'desire', i.e., he should not depend on anything except the self and be
without the 'sense of possession,' without the idea of mineness with
regard to anything other than the self.
