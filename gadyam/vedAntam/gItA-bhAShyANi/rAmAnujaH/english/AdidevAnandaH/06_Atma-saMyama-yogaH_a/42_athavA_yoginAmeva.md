6.42 If one swerves from the right path at an advanced stage of Yoga, he
will be born in a family of wise Yogins who practise Yoga and are
themselves capable of teaching Yoga. Thus, these two types of birth -

that of accomplished Yogins - are hardly met with among common people in
this world. But Yoga is of such great potentiality that even this rare
blessing is achieved through it.
