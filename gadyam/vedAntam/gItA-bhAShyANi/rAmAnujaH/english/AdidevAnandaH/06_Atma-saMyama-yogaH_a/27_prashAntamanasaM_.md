6.27 Supreme happiness, which is of the nature of experience of the self
in its essential nature comes to this Yogin whose 'mind is at peace,'
i.e., whose mind does not swerve from the self, whose mind abides in the
self; whose impurities are thery completely burnt away; whose Rajas is
thery 'wholly annulled,' i.e., in whom the ality of Rajas is destroyed;
and who has thus become the Brahman, i.e., who remains steady in his
essential nature as the Atman. 'Hi' (for) is added to indicate reason.
The meaning is this: 'On account of the nature of the self which has the
form of supreme bliss.'
