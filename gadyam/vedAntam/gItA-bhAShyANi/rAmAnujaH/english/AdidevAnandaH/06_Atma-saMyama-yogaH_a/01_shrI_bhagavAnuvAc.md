6.1 The Lord said He who, without depending on such fruits of works as
heaven, etc., performs them, reflecting, 'The performance of works alone
is my duty (Karya). Works themselves are my sole aim, because they are a
form of worship of the Supreme Person who is our Friend in every way.
There is nothing other than Him to be gained by them' - such a person is
a Sannyasin, i.e., one devoted to Jnana Yoga, and also a Karma Yogin,
i.e., one devoted to Karma Yoga. He is intent on both these, which is
the means for attaining Yoga, which is of the nature of the vision of
the self. 'And not he who maintains no sacred fires and performs no
works,' i.e., not he who is disinclined to perform the enjoined works
such as sacrifices, etc., nor he who is devoted to mere knowledge. The
meaning is that such a person is devoted only to knowledge, whereas a
person who is devoted to Karma Yoga has both knowledge and works. Now
Sri Krsna teaches that there is an element of knowledge in the Karma
Yoga as defined above.
