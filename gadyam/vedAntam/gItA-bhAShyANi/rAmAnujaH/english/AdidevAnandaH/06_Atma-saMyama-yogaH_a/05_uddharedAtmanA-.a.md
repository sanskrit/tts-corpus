6.5 By the self (Atman), i.e., by the mind, which is unattached to
sense-objects, one should raise the self. One should not allow the self
to sink by a mind which is of the contrary kind. 'For the self alone,'
i.e., the mind alone is the friend of the self; and it alone is the foe
of the self. \[The figure of speech here is of Samsara as the ocean in
which the individual self is like an object with liability to sink. What
causes its sinking is the lingering attachments of the mind to some
objects, though in the discipline of Jnana Yoga one may keep aloof from
such objects. A mind with such attachments is the foe and without them,
the friend.\]
