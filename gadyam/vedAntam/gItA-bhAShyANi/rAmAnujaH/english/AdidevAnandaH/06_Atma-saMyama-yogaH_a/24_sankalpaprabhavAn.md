6.24 - 6.25 There are two kinds of desires: 1) those born of contact
between the senses and objects like heat, cold etc.; 2) those generated
by our mind (will) like that for sons, land etc. Of these, the latter
type of desires are by their own nature relinishable. Relinishing all
these by the mind through contemplation on their lack of association
with the self; having relinished the ideas of pleasure and pain in
respect of unavoidable desires resulting from contract; restraining all
the senses on all sides, i.e., from contact with all their objects - one
should think of nothing else, i.e., other than the self. Little by
little 'with the help of intellect controlled by firm resolution,' i.e.,
by the power of discrimination, one should think of nothing else, having
fixed the mind on the self.
