6.35 The Lord said No doubt, the mind is hard to subdue on account of
its fickle nature. However, it can be subdued with difficulty by
cultivating favourable attitude in the direction of the self by repeated
contemplation of Its being a mind of auspicious attributes (these being
eternality, self-luminosity, bliss, freedom from Karma, purity etc.),
and by the absence of hankering produced by seeing the host of evil
alities in objects other than the self hankered for.
