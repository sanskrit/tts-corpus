6.9 'Well-wishers' (Suhrt) are those who wish one well, regardless of
differences in age. 'Friends' (Mitra) are well-wisheres of eal age.
'Foes' (Ari) are those who wish ill to one because of some particular
cause. 'The indifferent' (Udasina) are those devoid of both friendship
and hostility because of the absence of causes for both; 'neutrals'
(Madhyastha) are those who are by their very nature incapable of both
friendship and hostility. 'The hateful' are those who wish ill to one
even from birth. 'Relations' are those who bear goodwill from birth.
'The good' are those devoted to virtue. 'The sinful' are those given to
sin. Because of the self being the only end of Yoga, and because of
there being no gain and no opposition from well-wishers, friends, etc.,
he who could regard them all with an eal eye as selves, excels in
respect of fitness for the practice of Yoga.
