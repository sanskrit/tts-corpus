6.32 (iv) He who - because of the similarity between his own self and
other selves, as they are all constituted similarly of uncontracted
knowledge in their essential being - views the pleasures in the form of
the birth of a son and the sorrows in the form of the death of a son of
his own and of others, as eal, on the ground of their eal unrelatedness
to such pleasures and pains to him. Viewing his own pleasures and pains
of the above description as being not different from those of others of
the same kind - tht Yogin is deemed the highest; he is judged as having
reached the summit of Yoga. \[The idea is to prevent misconstruing the
verse as meaning that one shares the joy and misery of all as his own.
It means only that the highest type of yogins understand that the self
is unrelated to the pain and pleasures of his own body-mind. He
understands also that the same is the case with other selves.\]
