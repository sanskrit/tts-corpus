6.29 (i) On account of the similarity between one self and other selves
when They are separated from Prakrti (i.e., the body), all selves are by
Themselves only of the nature of knowledge. Inealities pertain only to
Prakrti or the bodies they are embodied in. One whose mind is fixed in
Yoga has the experience of the sameness of the nature of all the selves
as centres of intelligence, the perceived difference being caused only
by the body. When separated from the body all are alike because of their
being forms of centres of intelligence. An enlightened Yogin therefore
sees himself as abiding in all beings and all beings abiding in his self
in the sense that he sees the similarity of the selves in himself and in
every being. When one self is visualised, all selves become visulaised,
because of the similarity of all selves. This is supported by the
statements: 'He sees sameness everywhere' (6.29). The same is again
referred to in, 'This Yoga of eality which has been declared by you'
(6.33), and the statement 'The Brahman when uncontaminated is the same
everywhere' (5.19).
