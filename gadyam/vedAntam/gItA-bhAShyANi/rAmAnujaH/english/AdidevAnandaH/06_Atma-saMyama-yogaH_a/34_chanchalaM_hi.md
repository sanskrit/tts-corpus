6.34 For the mind, which is found to be fickle even in matters
incessantly practised, cannot be firmly fixed by a person in one place.
It agitates that person violently and flies away stubbornly elsewhere.
Regarding such a mind, which by nature is fickle even in matters
practised, I regard that its restraint and fixing in the self, which is
of ite opposite nature, is as difficult as restraining a strong contrary
gale with such things as a fragile fan etc. The meaning is that the
means for the restraint of the mind should be explained.
