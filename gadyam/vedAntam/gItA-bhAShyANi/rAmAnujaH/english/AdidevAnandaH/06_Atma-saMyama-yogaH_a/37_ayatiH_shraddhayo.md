6.37 - 6.39 Arjuna said What way does he go, who has embarked on Yoga
endowed with faith, but who by inadeacy of exertion in practice, does
not gain success in Yoga and has his mind wandering from Yoga; Does he
not perish like a small piece of cloud torn from a large mass of cloud -
perish without reaching another large mass of cloud; Now does he not
fall away from both (sides); He has no support and is confused on the
path leading to the Brahman. He is without any support in the sense that
Karma or rituals which constitutes the means of heaven etc., does not
give support for a person who is devoid of attachment to fruits; for
Karma is the means for generating its own fruits. He is also confused in
the path leading to the Brahman on which he has just begun to traverse;
He has lost his way. Does he then get lost by falling down from both
sides, these being attainment of heaven on the one hand and liberation
on the other. Does he not thus perish; You should remove this doubt
altogether from my mind; for there is no other remover of this doubt
than You, who always perceive directly all matters simultaneously.
