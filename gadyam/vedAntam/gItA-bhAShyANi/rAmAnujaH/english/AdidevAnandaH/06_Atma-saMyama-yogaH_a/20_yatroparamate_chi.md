6.20 - 6.23 Where, through the practice of Yoga, the mind, which is
subdued everywhere by such practice, 'rejoices', i.e., rejoices in
surpassing felicity; and where, perceiving through Yoga 'the self
(Atman)' by 'the mind (Atman)' one is delighted by the self and
indifferent to all other objects; and where, through Yoga, one 'knows',
i.e., experiences that infinite happiness which can be grasped only by
the 'intellect' contemplating on the self, but is beyond the grasp of
the senses; where, remaining in that Yoga, one does not 'swerve from
that state,' because of the overwhelming happiness that state confers;
having gained which, he desires for it alone, even when he is awakened
from Yoga, and does not hold anything else as a gain; where one is not
moved even by 'the heaviest sorrow' caused by any berevaement like that
of a virtuous son - let him know that disunion from all union with pain,
i.e., which forms the opposite of union with pain, is called by the term
Yoga. This Yoga must be practised with the determination of its nature
as such from the beginning with a mind free from despondency, i.e., with
zestful exaltation.
