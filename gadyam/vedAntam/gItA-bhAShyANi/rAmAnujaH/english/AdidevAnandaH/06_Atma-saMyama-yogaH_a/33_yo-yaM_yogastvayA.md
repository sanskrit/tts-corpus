6.33 Arjuna said This Yoga as explained by you consists in maintaining
eality of vision everywhere, viz., i) among themselves which have been
so far known to be of different kinds such as gods and men, and ii)
between the individual selves and the Supreme, in so far as (a) all the
selves are of the same form of knowledge, and (b) in so far as the
individual self (i.e., the released soul) and the Supreme are alike free
from Karma. I do not see how this Yoga can be steadily established in my
mind, fickle as the mind is.
