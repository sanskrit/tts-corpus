6.19 As a lamp does not flicker in a windless place, i.e., does not
move, but remains steady with its illumination - this is the simile used
to illustrate the nature of the self of the Yogin who has subdued his
mind, who has got rid of all other kinds of mental activity and who is
practising Yoga concerning the self. The meaning is that the self
remains with its steadily illumining light of knowledge because all
other activities of the mind have ceased, just as a lamp kept in a
windless place has an unflickering flame.
