6.18 When the mind which usually goes after sense enjoyments, abandons
such desires and 'rests on the self alone,' i.e., becomes well-settled
on account of discerning unsurpassable good in the self alone and rests
there alone steadily, without movement - then, being 'free of yearning
for all desires,' one is said to be integrated. He is said to be fit for
Yoga.
