10.32 Those that undergo creation are 'creatures'. Their beginning is
the cause. The meaning is that, of the creatures which are being created
at all times, I am Myself the creator. Similarly, I am the end, namely
the destroyer of everyone of those who are being destroyed at all times.
Similarly I am the middle, namely, the sustentation. The meaning is, I
am the sustainer of those who are being sustained at all times. Of those
who indulge in Jalpa (argument) and Vitanda (perverse criticism) etc., I
am the fair reasoning which determines the truth.
