10.33 Of letters I am the alphabet 'a', which is the base of all letters
as established in the Sruti: 'The letter 'a' itself is all speech' (Ai.
Ai., 3.2.3). Samasika means collection of compound words. In it, I am
the Dvandva compound; it is eminent because the meanings of both
constituent terms are important. I am Myself imperishable Time composed
of (divisions like) Kala, Muhurta etc. I am the four-faced Hiranyagarbha
who is the creator of all.
