10.18 Speak to me again in full, your association with the alities of
being the creator etc., and Your sovereignty, Your rulership, which have
been briefly described in 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed
everything' (10.8). For I am not satiated by hearing Your ambrosial
words. The meaning is, 'My enthusiasm to know more and more of your
ambrosial teachings is known to You.'
