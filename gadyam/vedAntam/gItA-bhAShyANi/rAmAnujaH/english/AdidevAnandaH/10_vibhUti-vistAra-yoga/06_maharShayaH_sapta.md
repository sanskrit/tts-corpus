10.6 'The seven great Rsis of yore', namely, those seven great Rsis like
Bhrgu etc., were from the mind of Brahma in the cycle of the past Manu
to perpetuate the creation permanently; and the four Manas called the
sons of Savarna existed for the work of eternal sustentation. All
creatures in the world are their progeny. So they are the generators of
this progeny as also their sustainers till the time of Pralaya. These
Bhrgu etc., and the Manus, derive their mental condition from Me. Their
disposition is My disposition - they subsist on My disposition. The
meaning is they follow My will.
