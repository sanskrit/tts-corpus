10.26 - 10.29 Of trees I am Asvattha which is worthy of worship. Of
celestial seers I am Narada. Kamadhuk is the divine cow. I am Kandarpa,
the cause of progeny. Sarpas are single-headed snakes while Nagas are
many-headed snakes. Aatic creatures are known as Yadamsi. Of them I am
Varuna. Of subdures, I am Yama, the son of the sun-god.
