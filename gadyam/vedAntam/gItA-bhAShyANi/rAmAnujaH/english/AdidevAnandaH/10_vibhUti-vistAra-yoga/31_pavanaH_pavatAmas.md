10.31 Of moving things, namely, of things whose nature is to move, I am
the wind. Of those who bear weapons, I am Rama. Here the ality of
bearing weapons is the Vibhuti, as no other sense is possible. Aditya
etc., being individual selves, constitute attributes of the Lord, who is
their Self as they constitute His body. Therefore they stand in the same
position of the attribute as that of bearing weapons.
