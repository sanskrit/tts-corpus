10.19 The Lord said O Arjuna, I shall tell you My auspicious
manifestations - those that are prominent among these. The term
'Pradhanya' connotes pre-eminence. For it will be said, 'Know Me to be
the chief among family priests' (10.24). I shall declare to you those
that are prominent in the world. For it would not be possible to tell or
listen to them in detail, because there is no limit to them. To be a
Vibhuti, the manifestation referred to should be under the control of
the Lord; because it is stated: 'He who in truth knows this supernal
manifestation and the seat of auspicious attributes' (10.7), after
listing the various kinds of mental dispositions like intelligence etc.,
of all beings. Similarly it has been stated there that 'being the
creator etc.,' is meant by the term Yoga, and that their 'being
actuated,' meant by the term Vibhuti. Again it is stated: 'I am the
origin of all; from me proceed everything; thinking thus, the wise
worship Me with all devotion' (10.8). Sri Krsna clearly declares that he
rules over all creatures by actuating them from within as their Self. He
also declares His being the creator, sustainer and destroyer of
everything, as connected by the term Yoga.
