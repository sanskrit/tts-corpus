10.7 'Supernal manifestation' is the glory (Vibhuti) of the Lord. He who
in truth knows this supernal manifestation that all origination,
sustentation and activity depend on Me, and also that Yoga of Mine which
is in the form of auspicious attributes antagonistic to all that is evil
- such a person becomes united with the Yoga or Bhakti of an unshakable
nature. Of this, there is no doubt. The meaning is: You yourself will
see that the knowledge concerning the supernal manifestation and
auspicious attributes of Mine will increase devotion. Sri Krsna now
shows that the growth of devotion is of the form of the development of
knowledge of His supreme state.
