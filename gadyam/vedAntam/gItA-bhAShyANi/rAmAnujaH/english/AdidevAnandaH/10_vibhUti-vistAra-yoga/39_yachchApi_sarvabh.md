10.39 Of all beings, in whatever condition they may exist, whether
manifest or not, I alone am that state. Whatever host of beings are said
to exist, they do not exist without Me as their Self. In the statement,
'Nothing that moves or does not move exists without Me', it is taught
that the Lord exists as the Self, as said in the beginning: 'I am the
Self, seated in the hearts of all beings' (10.20). The purport is that
the entire host of beings in every state, is united with Me, their Self.
By this He makes it clear that He, being the Self of all things, is the
ground for His being denoted by everything in co-ordinate predication.
