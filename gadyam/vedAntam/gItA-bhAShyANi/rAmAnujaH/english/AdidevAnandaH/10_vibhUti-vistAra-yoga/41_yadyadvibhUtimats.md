10.41 Whatever host of beings has 'power', namely the capacity and means
to rule over; has 'splendour', has beauty or prosperity in wealth,
grains etc., has 'energy,' namely, is engaged in auspicious undertakings
- know such manifestations as coming fro a fragment of My 'power'. Power
(Tejas) is the capacity to overcome opposition. The meaning is, know
them as arising from a fraction of My inconceivable power of subduing.
