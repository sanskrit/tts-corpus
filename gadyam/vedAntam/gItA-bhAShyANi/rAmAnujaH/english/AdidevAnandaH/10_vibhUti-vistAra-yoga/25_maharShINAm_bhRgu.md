10.25 Of great seers like Marici etc., I am Bhrgu. Words are sounds that
convey meaning. Of such words, I am the single-lettered word Pranava (Or
Om). Of the sacrifices, I am the sacrifice of Japa (sacred formula
silently repeated) which is the most prominent form of sacrificial
offerings. Of immovables or mountains, I am the Himalaya.
