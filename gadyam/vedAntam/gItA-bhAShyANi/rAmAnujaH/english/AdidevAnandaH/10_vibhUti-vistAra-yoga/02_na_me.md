10.2 However supernatural the vision and however great the knowledge of
the host of the gods and the wise seers may be, they cannot comprehend
My powers. They do not know My name, actions, essence, attributes etc.,
for the reason that I am the source in every way of these gods and great
seers. I am the source of their nature and knowledge, power etc. The
knowledge given to them by Me according to their meritorious deeds
constitutes the cause of their being gods, the great seers etc. That
knowledge is limited. Thus, they have limited knowledge and do not know
the real nature of My essence. Sri Krsna proceeds to explain that
knowledge about His real nature, which is beyond the grasp of gods etc.,
and which is the means for release from the evil that stands in the way
of the rise of devotion.
