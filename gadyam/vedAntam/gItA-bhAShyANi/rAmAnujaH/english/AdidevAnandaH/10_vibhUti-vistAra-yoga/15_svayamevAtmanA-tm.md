10.15 O Supreme Person, You Yourself know Yourself by Yourself; namely,
by virtue of Your knowledge! O Creator of beings, namely, O Originator
of all beings! O Lord of all beings, namely, O Controller of all beings!
O God of gods, namely, O the Supreme Deity even of all divinities! Just
as the gods surpass men, animals, birds, reptiles etc., in beauty,
condescension and the host of auspicious alities, You, O Lord, in the
same manner, transcend all these gods in all these attributes! O Ruler
of the universe, O Master of the universe!
