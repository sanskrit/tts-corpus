title = "21 आदित्यानामहं"

10.21 Of Adityas, who are twelve in number, I am the twelfth Aditya,
called Visnu, who is paramount. Of luminuous bodies, namely, among
luminaries in the world, I am the sun, the most brilliant luminary. Of
Maruts I am the paramount Marici. Of constellations, I am the moon. The
genitive case here is not to specify one out of many included in a
group. Its use is the same as what is exemplifed in the statement 'I am
the consciousness in all beings' (10.22). I am the moon who is the Lord
of the constellations.
