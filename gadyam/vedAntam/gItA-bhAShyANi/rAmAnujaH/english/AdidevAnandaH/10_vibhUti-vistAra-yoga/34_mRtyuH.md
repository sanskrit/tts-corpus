10.34 I am also death which snatches away the life of all. Of those that
shall be born I am that called birth. Of women (i.e., of goddesses who
are the powers of the Lord) I am prosperity (Sri); I am fame (Kirti); I
am speech (Vak); I am memory (Smrti); I am intelligence (Medha); I am
endurance (Dhrti); and I am forgiveness (Ksama).
