10.14 Therefore, I deem all this to be a statement of facts as they are
in reality, and not merely an exaggeration - all this which You tell me
of Your sovereign glory and infinite auspicious attributes which are
unie, unbounded, unsurpassed and natural. Therefore, O Lord, O Treasure
of unsurpassed knowledge, power, strength, sovereignty, valour and
radiance! - neither the gods nor the demons who possess limited
knowledge know 'Your manifestation', the way in which You manifest
Yourself.
