10.17 I, 'Your devotee' (Yogin), namely, one engaged in Bhakti Yoga, and
'constantly meditating on You' with devotion, namely, embarked on
meditation on You, - how am I to know You, the object of meditation, as
possessing a multitude of auspicious attributes like sovereignty etc.;
And in what varied modes of mental dispositions, which are as yet untold
and which are different from the intelligence, knowledge etc., described
earlier, are You the Controller of all, to be meditated upon by me.
