10.1 The Lord said Listen with rapt attention to these words which I
shall utter - words which are supreme and which give you a much wider
understanding of My greatness. I shall speak out to you about the rise
and growth of devotion to Me, as you are pleased with listening to My
greatness and as I too love you.
