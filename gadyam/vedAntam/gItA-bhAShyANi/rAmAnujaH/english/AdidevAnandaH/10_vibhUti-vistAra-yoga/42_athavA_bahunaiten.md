10.42 What is the use to you of this detailed knowledge taught by Me; I
sustain this universe with an infinitesimal fraction of My power - this
universe consisting of sentient and non-sentient entities, whether in
effect or causal condition, whether gross or subtle - in such a manner
that it does not violate My will in preserving its proper form,
existence and various activities. As said by Bhagavan Parasara: 'On an
infinitesimal fraction of this energy, this universe rests' (V. P.,
1.9.53).
