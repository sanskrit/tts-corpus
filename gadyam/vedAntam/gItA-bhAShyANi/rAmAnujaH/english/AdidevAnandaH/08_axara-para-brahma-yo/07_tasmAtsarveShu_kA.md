8.7 Therefore, at all times, until your departure, remember Me, day
after day. Engage yourself in actions appropriate to your station and
stage in life, which would make you remember Me. These actions are
prescribed by the Srutis and Smrtis and comprise the periodical and
occasional rites. Thus, by this means, with your mind and intellect set
on Me, you will remember Me at the time of death and thus attain to Me
in the manner desired by you. There is no doubt about this. Thus, having
laid down the common principle that the attainment of one's end is
dependent on one's last thought, Sri Krsna proceeds to describe
different modes of contemplation (Upasana) to be practised by the three
groups of devotees for aciring their objectives. Of these, he first
speaks about the modes of contemplation to be adopted by the seekers of
enjoyments and power and the type of the last thought consistent with
their contemplation.
