8.16 All the worlds, from the realm of Brahma included in the Brahmanda
(cosmic sphere), are spheres in which experiences conferring Aisvarya
(prosperity and power) can be obtained. But they are destructible and
those who attain them are subject to return. Therefore destruction,
i.e., return is unavoidable for the aspirants for Aisvarya, as the
regions where it is attained perish. On the contrary there is no rirth
to those who attain Me, the Omniscient, who has true resolves, whose
sport is creation, sustentation and dissolution of the entire universe,
who is supremely compassionate and who is always of the same form. For
these reasons there is no destruction in the case of those who attain
Me. He now elucidates the time-period settled by the Supreme Person's
will in regard to the evolution and dissolution of the worlds upto the
cosmic sphere of Brahma and of those who are within them.
