8.23 - 8.24 Here, the term 'time' denotes a path, having many deities
beginning with day and ending with year. The deities preside over
divisions of time. The meaning is - I declare to you the path departing
in which Yogins do not return and also the path departing in which the
doers of good actions return. By the clause, 'Light in the form of fire,
the day, bright fortnight, six months of the northern course,' year also
is denoted.
