8.11 I shall show you briefly that goal which the knowers of the Veda
call 'the imperishable,' i.e., as endowed with attributes like
non-grossness etc., - that imperishable which 'the ascetics freed from
passion enter'; that imperishable 'desiring to attain which men practise
continence'. What is attained by the mind as its goal is called 'pada'.
I shall tell you briefly My essential nature which is beyond all
description and which is explained in the whole of Vedanta and which is
to be meditated upon. Such is the meaning.
