8.9 - 8.10 He who focusses his life-breath between the eyrows at the
time of death with a mind rendered unswerving through its purification
achieved by the strength of Yoga conjoined with Bhakti practised day
after day; and he who contemplates on the 'Kavi' i.e., the Omniscient,
the 'Primeval', i.e., who existed always, 'the Ruler,' i.e., who governs
the universe, 'who is subtler than the subtle,' i.e., who is subtler
than the individual self, 'who is the Dhata' of all, i.e., the creator
of all, 'whose nature is inconceivable,' i.e., whose nature is other
than everything else, 'who is sun-coloured and beyond darkness,' i.e.,
who possesses a divine form peculiar to Himself - he who concentrates on
Him, the Divine Person described above, between the eyrows, attains Him
alone. He attains His state and comes to have power and glory similar to
His. Such is the meaning. Then He describes the mode of meditation to be
adopted by the seeker of Kaivalya or the Jijnasu (i.e., of one who seeks
to know his own self or Atman in contrast to one whose object is
God-realisation).
