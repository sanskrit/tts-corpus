8.12 - 8.13 Subduing all the senses like ear etc., which constitute the
'doorways' for sense impressions, i.e., withdrawing them from their
natural functions; holding the mind in Me, the imperishable 'seated
within the lotus of the heart'; practising 'steady abstraction of mind
(Dharana) which is called concentration or Yoga,' i.e., abiding in Me
alone in a steady manner; uttering the sacred 'syllable Om,' the brahman
which connotes Me; remembering Me, who am expressed by the syllable Om;
and fixing his 'life-breath within the head' - whosoever abandons the
body and departs in this way reaches the highest state. He reaches the
pure self freed from Prakrti, which is akin to My form. From that state
there is no return. Such is the meaning. Later on Sri Krsna will
elucidate: 'They describe that as the highest goal of the Atman, which
is not destroyed when all things are destroyed, which is unmanifest and
imperishable' (8.2021). Thus, the modes of contemplation on the Lord by
the aspirants after prosperity and Kaivalya (Atmann-consciousness) have
been taught according to the goal they lead to. Now, Sri Krsna teaches
the way of meditation on the Lord by the Jnanin and the mode of
attainment by him.
