8.8 Contemplating on Me, the Supreme Divine Person, in the way to be
specified further, at the last moment, with a mind trained by constant
practice and Yoga, and not moving towards anything else, one reaches Me
alone, i.e., attains a form similar to that of Mine, by virtue of the
attributes of enjoyment and the prosperity contemplated upon, like the
royal sage Bharata who acired the form of a deer on account of
contemplating on it at the last moment. Abhyasa is the training of the
mind to be often in touch with the object of meditation at all times
without obstruction to the performance of the prescribed periodical and
occasional rituals. Yoga is the meditation practised day by day at the
time of Yoga practice in the manner prescribed.
