8.26 The bright path is characterised by the terms 'starting with
light.' The dark path is characterised by the 'terms starting with
smoke.' By the bright path a man goes to the plane of no-return, but he
who goes by the dark path returns again. In the Sruti both the bright
and dark paths are said to be eternal in relation to Jnanis and doers of
good actions of many kinds. This is corroborated in the text: 'Those who
know this and those who worship with faith do Tapas in the forest etc.,
they go to the light' (Cha. U., 5.10.1), and 'But those who in the
village perform Vedic and secular acts of a meritorious nature and the
giving of alms - they pass to the smoke' (ibid., 5.10.3).
