8.14 I am easy to access to that Yogin who is 'ever integrated with Me,'
i.e., who wants constant contact with Me, who recollects Me; and whose
mind is not in 'anything else without break' (Nityasah), i.e., at the
time of meditation and also during all other times (Satatam). As I am
exceedingly dear to him, he is unable to sustain himself without
remembering Me and cherishing My memory which is incomparably dear to
him. I am the only object he wants to attain and not any mode of My
being like sovereignty, etc. I Myself grant him the capacity to attain
full maturity in devotional practice necessary for attaining Me -
namely, the annulment of all obstacles and the establishment of the
state of mind that renders Me exceedingly dear to oneself. The Sruti
also says: 'He whom this (Self) chooses, by him He can be obtained'
(Mun. U., 3.2.3 and Ka. U., 2.22). And Sri Krsna Himself will teach: "To
those, ceaselessly united, who worship Me, I bestow that discernment by
which they come to Me. Out of mercy for them, I, abiding in their heart,
dispel the darkness born of ignorance, by the brilliant lamp of
knowledge" (10.10;11). In the remaining part of this chapter, He teaches
that the Jnanis and the aspirants after Kaivalya do not deturn, and that
the seekers after power and prosperity return.
