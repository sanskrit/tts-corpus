8.18 Thus, at the dawn of a day of Brahma, the manifest entities
existing in the three worlds, possessing body, senses, objects, and
places of enjoyment appear from the non-manifest (Avyakta), which is the

night they are dissolved into the condition of the unevolved (Avyakta)
which forms the body of Brahma then.
