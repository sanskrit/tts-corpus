18.4 Regarding contradictory versions on Tyaga among disputants, listen
from Me My decision. Tyaga has been described by Me in respect of
actions prescribed by the scriptures from three points of view: (1) as
referring to fruits, (2) as referring to acts themselves and, (3) as
referring to agency. It is contained in the statement, 'Surrendering all
your actions to Me with a mind focussed on the self,' and 'Free from
desire and selfishness and cured of fever - fight' (3.30). The
renunciation of fruits consists in the following manner. 'Heaven and
such other results arising from acts do not belong to Me.' Renunciation
of acts is complete abandonment of the sense of possession in regard to
one's acts. This sense of possession is of the following nature: 'Those
acts are mine on account of their being the means for fruits which are
to be mine.' Renunciation referring to agency is the renunciation of
agency of oneself by ascribing the agency to the Lord of all.
