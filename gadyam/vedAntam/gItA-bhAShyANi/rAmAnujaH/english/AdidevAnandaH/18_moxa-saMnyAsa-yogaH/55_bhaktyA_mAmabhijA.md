18.55 Through such devotion, he knows 'who I am,' i.e., knows My own
essence and My nature, and 'what I am,' i.e., in My attributes and
glory. Knowing Me truly, he rises to a higher level than this Bhakti,
and aciring knowledge of the truth, enters into Me through devotion. The
meaning is that he attains Me by means of infinite and unsurpassed
Bhakti which develops subseent in time to the vision of the nature,
attributes and glory of the Lord in reality. Here the term 'Tatah'
(through) denotes that devotion is the cause of attainment; for it has
been stated to be the cause of entrance n the text, 'But by
singel-minded devotion it is possible ৷৷.' (11.54). In this way, the
crowning development has been told starting from the disinterested
performance of periodical and occasional rites suitable for the various
stations and stages of life, which are to be performed to propitiate the
Supreme Person. Sri Krsna now explains that even for actions meant for
attaining desired objects (Kamya-karmas) the crowning stage is the same
as for these described above, provided they too are done not for
fulfilling one's desires but as offerings to propitiate the Supreme
Person.
