18.27 The 'passionate' doer is one who aspires for fame; 'who seeks the
fruits of his acts' is one who longs for the fruits of his acts; the
'greedy' is he who does not spend the wealth reired for the act; the
'harmful' is one, who while acting, hurts others; the 'impure', is one
who lacks the purity reired for the act; who is moved by 'delight and
grief' in war etc., is one who is elated or depressed by success or
failure in victory (or the opposite) - a doer who fulfils these
conditions is declared to be Rajasika.
