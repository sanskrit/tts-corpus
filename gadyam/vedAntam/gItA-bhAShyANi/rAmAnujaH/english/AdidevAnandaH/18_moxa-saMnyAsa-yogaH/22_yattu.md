18.22 But that knowledge which clings to a 'single type of act' as what
ought to be done, viz., act in the form of the worship of ghosts or evil
spirits yielding very small fruits, as if it yielded all fruits; that
work 'not founded on any reason for having attachment,' because it is
not a source of all fruits; 'untrue' because it is based on a false view
of things such as seeing differentiation in the nature of the Atman;
'insignificant', because the worship of ghosts and evil spirits yields
poor results - for such reasons knowledge of this kind is declared to be
Tamasika. After having thus classified the threefold division of
knowledge relating to work according to Gunas in respect of a person who
is alified for work, Sri Krsna explains the triple division of the acts
that ought to be done, according to Gunas.
