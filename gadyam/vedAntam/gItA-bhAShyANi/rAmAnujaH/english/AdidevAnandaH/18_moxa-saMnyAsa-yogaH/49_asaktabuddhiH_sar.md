18.49 He whose understanding is, on all sides, without attachments,
concerning fruits etc., whose 'self is conered,' i.e., who has conered
his mind; who, by contemplating on the agency of the Supreme Person, is
free from the habit of attributing agency to the self; and who is thus
eipped with Sannyasa which has been positively determined to be the same
as Tyaga - such a man, performing actions, attains supreme perfection
which is free from all activities. The meaning is that he attains
devotion to Dhyana which is the consummation of even Jnana Yoga; he
attains Dhyana Yoga (Yoga of meditation) consisting in the complete
cessation of sensory activity, which is going to be described hereafter.
