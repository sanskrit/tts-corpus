18.8 Although actions constitute the indirect menas for release, yet
they produce mental depression, since they can be done only by
collecting materials involving painful effort and since they cause
bodily strain on account of their reiring strenuous exertion. If, on
account of such fear, one decides that the practice of knowledge alone
should be tried for perfection in Yoga, and abandons actions like the
great sacrifices applicable to one's station in life, he practises
renunciation rooted in Rajas. Since that is not the meaning of the
Sastras, one cannot win the fruit of renunciation in the form of the
rise of knowledge. So it will be shown further one: 'That reason by
which one erroneously knows, O Arjuna, is Rajasika' (18.31). In fact,
actions do not directly cause purity of the mind but indirectly by
winning the grace of God.
