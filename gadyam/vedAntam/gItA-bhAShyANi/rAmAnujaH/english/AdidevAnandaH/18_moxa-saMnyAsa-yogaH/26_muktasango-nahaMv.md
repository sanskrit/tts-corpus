18.26 'Muktasangah' is one who is free from attachment to fruits.
'Anahamvadi' is one who is devoid of the feeling of being the agent. He
is endued with 'steadiness and zeal.' 'Steadiness' is perseverance in
regard to an act that has been begun in spite of the pain that is
inevitable till the completion of the work. 'Zeal' is the possession of
an active mind. One who is enduded with these, and whose mind remains
firm, untouched by success and failure in war etc., and also in
gathering the material reisities for the work on hand - such an agent
is, of Sattvika nature.
