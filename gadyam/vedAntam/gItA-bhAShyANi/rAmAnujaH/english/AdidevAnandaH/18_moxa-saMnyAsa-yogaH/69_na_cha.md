18.69 There never exists nor has existed anyone other than such a person
as described, who does greater service to Me than he. In the future too,
there will not be another such. The first reference is to those who are
not worthy to hear the Gita. It is meant to teach that explaining it to
them is more displeasing to the Lord than not teaching to those who are
worthy.
