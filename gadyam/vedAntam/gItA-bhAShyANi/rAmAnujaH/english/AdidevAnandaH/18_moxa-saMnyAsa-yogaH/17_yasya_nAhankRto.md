18.17 He who, through the contemplation of the agency of the Supreme
Being, is free from the self-conceit, 'I alone do everything'; he whose
understanding is not therefore tainted, and has come to be informed by
the understanding; 'As I am not the agent of this work, its fruit is not
connected with me; so this work does not belong to me' - such a person,
though he slays all these men, not merely Bhisma, etc., does not slay
them. Therefore, he is not bound by the actions known as battle. The
meaning is that the fruits of such actions do not accrue to him. Sri
Krsna now teaches how action is induced. For this he differentiates
actions generated by Sattva and the other Gunas. The object is to
inculcate the desirability of the Sattvika type. For, only meditation on
the self not being the agent, brings about the growth of Sattva.
