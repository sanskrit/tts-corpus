18.47 One's proper Dharma is that which is suitable for performance by
oneself, in the form of worshipping Myself, relinishing agency etc., as
has been taught. For, Karma Yoga, consisting in the activities of sense
organs, is easy to perform by one in association with Prakrti. Thus,
Karma Yoga, even if it is defective in some respects, is better than the
Dharma of another, i.e., than Jnana-yoga, even for a person capable of
controlling his senses, which is an attainment liable to negligence,
because it consists of control over all sense-organs; for, though this
may be well performed occasionaly, one is always liable to deflection
from it. He explains the same: As Karma consists of the activities of
the sense-organs, it is ordained by Nature for one who is conjoined with
Prakrti, i.e., the body. So by performing Karma Yoga one does not incur
any stain. But Jnana Yoga is liable to negligence, because it reires the
control of the senses from the very beginning for its performance. One
intent on it is likely to incur stain from negligence. \[Thus we are
reminded about what was mentioned in the third chapter - that Karma Yoga
alone is greater.\]
