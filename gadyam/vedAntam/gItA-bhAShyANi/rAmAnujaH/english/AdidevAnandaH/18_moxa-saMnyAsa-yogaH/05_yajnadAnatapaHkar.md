18.5 Acts such as sacrifices, gifts, austerities etc., enjoined in the
Vedas should not be relinished by the aspirant for release, but should
be performed day after day until his death. Why; Acts like sacrifices,
gifts and austerities associated with the different stations of life,
are the means of purification for the wise., i.e., for those given to
contemplation. Contemplation is worship. For the aspirants who perform
such worship (Upasana) throughout their lives, they (sacrifices etc.)
are a help to erase the previous Karmas which stand in the way of the
fulfilment of such worship.
