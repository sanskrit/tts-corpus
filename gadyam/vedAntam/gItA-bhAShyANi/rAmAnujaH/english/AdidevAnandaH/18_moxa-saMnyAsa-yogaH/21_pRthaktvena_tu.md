18.21 Whatever knowledge perceives in Brahmana etc., at the time of
work, the entity known as the Atman as of diverse nature because the
bodies of those beings are tall or fair and are fit to attain the fruits
of work - know that knowledge to be Rajasika. The point is this: It is
not a condemnation of the plurality of Atman. The Atman, though
distinct, is uniform everywhere. The bodily attributes do not affect it.
The knowledge lacking this understanding is stigmatised as Rajasa.
