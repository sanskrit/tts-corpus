18.32 That Buddhi is of the nature of Tamas which is 'enveloped in
Tamas' and 'reverses every value.' The meaning is that it regards
Adharma as Dharma and Dharma as Adharma, existent as non-existent, and
non-existent as existent, and higher truth as the lower and the lower
truth as the higher, and thus reverses every value.
