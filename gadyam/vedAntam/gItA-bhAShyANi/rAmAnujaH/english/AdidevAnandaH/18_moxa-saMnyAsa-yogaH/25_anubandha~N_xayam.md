18.25 'Anubandha' or conseence is here the pain which follows when a
work is performed. 'Loss' means loss of wealth involved in doing that
act. 'Injury' is the pain caused to living beings when the work is
carried out. 'Capacity' is the ability of completing the act. Whenever
an act is begun without consideration of these and from delusion, viz.,
due to ignoring the agency of the Supreme Person - that act is said to
be Tamasika.
