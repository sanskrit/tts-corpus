18.41 The nature of Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras are due to
their respective inherent dispositions. The meaning is that their past
Karma has been the cause of determining births as Brahmanas etc. The
Sattva and other Gunas are the result of such Karma. The Sattva-guna is
born from the inherent nature of the Brahmana becoming dominant by
suppressing the alities of Rajas and Tamas. The ality of Rajas
originates from the inherent nature of the Ksatriyas becoming dominant
by suppressing alities of Sattva and Tamas. Tamoguna arises from the
inherent nature of the Vaisya, becoming dominant in a little way by
suppressing Sattva and Rajas. The duties and works assigned to them
according to the Gunas constituting their inherent nature, are expounded
and allotted by the Sastras in the order described. For the Sastras
analyse that the Brahmanas etc., possess such and such attributes and
such and such are their duties and occupations.
