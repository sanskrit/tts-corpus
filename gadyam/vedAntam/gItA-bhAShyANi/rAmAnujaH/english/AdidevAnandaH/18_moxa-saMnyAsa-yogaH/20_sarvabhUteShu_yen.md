18.20 The self (Atman), which is of the form of knowledge, is alike and
uniform, though distinct, in all beings, even though they may
externally, and from the point of view of duty, be distinguished as
Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, householders, celibates, fair, tall etc. The
immutable selves in all these perishing forms or bodies are unaffected
by the fruits of actions. Such knowledge of the immutability of the self
in all changing beings, is Sattvika.
