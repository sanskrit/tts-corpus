18.30 'Activity' is that Dharma which is the means for wordly
prosperity. 'Renunciation' is that Dharma which is the means for
release. The Buddhi which knows both these as they are, is
Sattviki-buddhi. Further, such a Buddhi is capable of distinguishing
between what ought to be done and what ought not to be done by persons
of different stations in life, having as their duty activity or
renunciation at particular places or times. Such a Buddhi helps them to
know 'This ought to be done and this ought not to be done.' Such a
Buddhi discerns transgression of the Sastras as the cause of fear and
observance of the Sastras as the cause of fearlessness. It enables one
to distinguish between bondage and release, the true nature of Samsara
and deliverance from it. The Buddhi that functions in these ways is
Sattvika.
