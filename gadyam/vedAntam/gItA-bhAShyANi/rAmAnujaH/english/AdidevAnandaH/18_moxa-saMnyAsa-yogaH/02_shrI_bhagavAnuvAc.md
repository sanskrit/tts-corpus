18.2 The Lord said Some scholars understand that Sannyasa is complete
relinishment of desire-prompted acts. Some other wise men say that the
meaning of the term Tyaga, according to the Sastras dealing with
release, is relinishment of the fruits not only of all desiderative
(Kamya), but also of obligatory and occasional, duties . Here, the
problem is, whether the Tyaga taught in the Sastras concern desiderative
acts themselves, or fruits of all acts. Sri Krsna has used the terms
Sannyasa in one place and Tyaga elsewhere. From this it is understood
that Sri Krsna uses the terms Tyaga and Sannyasa as synonyms. Likewise,
the decisive teaching is about Tyaga alone in the statement: 'Hear My
decision, O Arjuna, about Tyaga' (18.4). That the terms are synonymously
used to denote the same sense, is conclusively established from such
passages as: 'But the renunciation (Sannyasa) of obligatory work is not
proper. Abandonment (Tyaga) of it through delusion is declared to be
Tamasika' (18.7); and 'To those who have not renounced the fruits of
actions, threefold are the conseences after death - undesirable,
desriable and mixed. But to those who have renounced, none whatsoever'
(18.12).
