18.28 'Ayukta' is the doer who is unalified for acts enjoined by the
Sastras; the meaning is that he is engaged in perverse acts; who is
'unrefined', means one uninstructed; who is 'stubborn', means one who is
not disposed to act; who is 'depraved' means one who has the taste for
black magic etc; who is dishonest is one who is treacherous; who is
'indolent' is one who is not inclined to carry out actions undertaken;
who is 'despondent' is one given to excessive despondency; and one who
is 'dilatory', is a person who, while engaged in black magic, etc., pays
malevolent attention to produce long-standing evil to others - such a
doer is declared to be Tamasika. Thus, has been told the threefold
division in terms of the Gunas of the knowledge about the work that
ought to be performed, and about the agent of work. Now, Sri Krsna
describe s the threefold division of Buddhi and Dhrti (fortitude) on the
basis of Gunas. These faculties give the determinate knowledge of all
realities in existence and of all ends of human life (Purusarthas).
