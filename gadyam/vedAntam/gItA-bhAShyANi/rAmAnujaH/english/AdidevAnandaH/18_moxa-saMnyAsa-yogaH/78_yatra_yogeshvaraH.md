18.78 Wherever there is Sri Krsna, the son of Vasudeva, the 'Yogesvara'
who is the ruler of the various manifestations of Nature pertaining to
all intelligent and non-intelligent entities that have high and low
forms, and on whose volition depend the differences in the essential
natures, existences and the activities of all things other than Himself,
and wherever there is Arjuna, the archer, who is his paternal aunt's son
and who took sole refuge at His feet - in such places there always will
be present fortune, victory, wealth and sound morality. Such is my firm
conviction.
