18.9 When rites like obligatory and occasional ceremonies and the great
sacrifices enjoined on one's station and stage in life, are practised
for their own sake, as worship of Myself and as a duty, relinishing
possessiveness and fruits - such abandonment is regarded as Sattvika. It
is noted in Sattva. The idea is that it is rooted in the knowledge of
the meaning of the Sastras as it really is. That Sattva generates the
knowledge of things as they really are, has been taught in: 'From Sattva
arises knowledge' (14.17), and it will be further declared: 'That reason
by which one knows action and renunciation, what ought to be done and
what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and release, O
Arjuna, is Sattvika' (18.30).
