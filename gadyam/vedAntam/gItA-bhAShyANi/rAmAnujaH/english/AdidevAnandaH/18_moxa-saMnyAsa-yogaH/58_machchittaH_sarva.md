18.58 Thus, focusing your thought on Me, if you can perform all acts,
you will, by My grace, cross over all difficulties of Samsara. If,
however, out of 'self-conceit,' i.e., out of the feeling, 'I know well
what is to be done and what is not to be done' - out of such a feeling,
if you do not heed My words, you shall perish. Except Myself, there is
none who knows what ought and what ought not to be done by all living
beings; there is also none other than Myself who is in the position of a
law-giver to them.
