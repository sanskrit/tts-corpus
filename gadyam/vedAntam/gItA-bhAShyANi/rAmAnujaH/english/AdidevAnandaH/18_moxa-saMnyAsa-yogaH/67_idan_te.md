18.67 I have taught you this most secret doctrine. This should not be
imparted by you to someone who has not practised austere disciplines.
Never should this be taught to someone who is not devoted to Me and to
you, the teacher (i.e., when you have to play the role of a teacher of
this doctrine). The meaning is that it should not be taught by you to
someone who, though practising austerities, is not a devotee and does
not serve Me. It is also never to be taught to one who has no wish to
listen, even though he is a devotee. Nor should it be imparted to one
who traduces Me, that is, who - when My nature, glories and attributes
are described - discovers defects in them. The differences of case (from
ablative to nominative form) is to teach that the last one is the most
despicable character.
