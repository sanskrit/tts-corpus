18.71 A man who, with faith and without cavilling, hears the Gita when
faught by a alified teacher, he too is, by such hearing, released from
all evil incompatible with devotional life. He shall reach the Lokas,
i.e., the realms of the hosts of My devotees who have done virtuous
acts, and who will facilitate the growth of devotion in these new
arrivals and lead them ultimately to liberation.
