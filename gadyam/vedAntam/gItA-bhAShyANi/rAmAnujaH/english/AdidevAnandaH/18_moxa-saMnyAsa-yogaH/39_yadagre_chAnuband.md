18.39 Pleasure of the Tamasika type causes delusion to the self at the
beginning and the end of enjoyment. Here 'delusion' means the absence of
knowledge about things as they are. Pleasure springing from sleep, sloth
and error are the cause of it. Even at the time of experience, sleep
etc., are the cause of delusion. It is clear how sleep causes delusion.
'Sloth' is indolence in sensory operations. When sensory activities are
slow, dimness of knowledge results. 'Error' is heedlessness regarding
what ought to be done. From this also occurs the dimness of knowledge.
Thus, these two also cause delusion. Such pleasure is declared to be
Tamasika. Therefore what is meant is this: subduing Rajas and Tamas, the
Sattva alone should be allowed to develop by the aspirant for relase.
