18.34 That Dhrti by which a person who, desirous of fruits, i.e.,
through intense attachment holds fast to duty, desires, and wealth, is
of the nature of Rajas. By the terms 'Dharma-kam'artha,' the activities
of the mind, vital force and senses as a means for the attainment of
Dharma (duty) Kama (pleasure) and Artha (wealth) are signified. Even in
the expression, 'One desirous of fruits,' that term indicates duty,
desire and wealth, on account of the Rajasika nature of the aspirant.
Therefore, what is said amounts to this: the Dhrti by which one
maintains activities of the mind etc., with the purpose of attaining
duty; desire and wealth, is of the nature of Rajas.
