18.40 There is no Sattva or creature born either among men etc., on the
earth or among the gods in heaven, from Brahma down to immobile things,
and having their basis in Prakrti, that is free from the dominance of
the three Gunas of Prakrti. 'Tyaga', which has been determined as
forming the means for release in the Sruti texts like 'By Tyaga alone do
they attain immortality' (Ma. Na., 8.14), is of the same meaning as of
the word 'Sannyasa'. It is rooted in the relinishment of the sense of
agency in actions that are being performed. The relinishment of the
results and of possessiveness in actions, and the relinguishing of
agency are to be gained by ascribing the agency to the Supreme Person.
As all these are the effects of the increase of Sattva-guna, the
differences of the effects of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas have been
described at length with a view to instruct that Sattva is to be
cultivated. Now Sri Krsna, with a view to inculcate that actions done
including their fruits, as a means to release and attainment of Him,
must be of the nature of the worship of the Supreme Person, and that the
fruit thereof is the attainment of Him - describes the actions
obligatory for the alified classes of the people such as Brahmanas,
differentiated by virtue of the natural alities arising from the Gunas
such as Sattva, as also the occupations prescribed for those classes.
