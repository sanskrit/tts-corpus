18.24 But whatever act is performed by one who seeks to gratify his
desires, viz., by one who desires the results of his action and with the
feeling of egoism, viz., has the misconceived notion that oneself is the
agent; and with a great deal of effort - such an act is of the nature of
Rajas. Here va (or) is used in the sense of ca (and). Whatever action is
performed by one who possesses the misconceived notion, 'This action
demanding enormous effort is performed entirely by me' - it is said to
be Rajasika.
