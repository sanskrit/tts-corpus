18.37 That pleasure, which 'at the beginning,' i.e., at the time of
beginning of Yoga, is 'like poison,' i.e., is painful because it reires
strenuous efforts and because the distinct nature of the self is not yet
experienced, but which after long practice fructifies in the blissful
experience of the self - that joy born of a serene state of mind
'focusing on the self' is Sattvika. The Buddhi concerning the self is
'Atama-buddhi.' When all objects are withdrawn from that Buddhi it
becomes serene (Prasanna). The joy born of the experience of the self in
its distinct nature, when all objects are withdrawn from the Buddhi,
becomes 'like elixir'. That joy is said to be Sattvika.
