18.38 That which at the 'beginning,' i.e., at the time of experience
looks like elixir because of the contact of senses with their objects
agreable to them, but 'at the end,' i.e., when satiation or further
incapacity to enjoy due to over-indulgence in them occurs, looks life
poison - that pleasure is said to be Rajasika. In this latter state
these so-called enjoyments cause the misery of Naraka.
