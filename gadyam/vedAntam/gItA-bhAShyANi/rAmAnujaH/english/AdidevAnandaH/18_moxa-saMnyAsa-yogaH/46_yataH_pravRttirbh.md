18.46 He from whom arise all activities as origination of all beings and
by whom all this is pervaded, by worshipping Him, i.e., Myself, who
abide in Indra and other divinites as the Inner Ruler, man attains
perfection, consisting in the attainment of Myself by My grace. It has
been told before that everything originates from Me and all this is
pervaded by Me, in texts like the following: 'I am the origin and
dissolution of the whole universe' (7.6), 'There is nothing higher than
Myself, O Arjuna' (7.7), 'This entire universe is pervaded by Me in an
unmanifest form' (9.4), 'Under My supervision, the Prakrti gives birth
to all mobile and immobile entities' (9.10) and 'I am the origin of all;
from Me proceed everything' (10.8).
