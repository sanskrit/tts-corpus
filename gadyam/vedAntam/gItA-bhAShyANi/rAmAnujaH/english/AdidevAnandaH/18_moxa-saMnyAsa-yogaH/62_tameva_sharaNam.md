18.62 Such being the case, take refuge with all your heart
(Sarvabhavena), by every disposition of your body, senses and mind
(Sarvatmana) in Him - Him, the ruler of all, who has become your
charioteer out of compassion for dependents, and who orders you, 'Act
thus' and so on. Even if you do not do so now, fighting in battle etc.,
is inevitable for you who are ignorant and actuated by His Maya, but
then you will get ruined. Therefore, fight etc., in the manner which has
been explained by Him. Such is the meaning. Acting in this way, you will
attain supreme peace, release from all bondage, and the eternal abode.
Hundreds of Srutis declare it: 'That supreme place of Visnu which the
sages see' (Rg. S., 1.2.6.5); 'They become meritorious and reach this
heaven where Devas and Sadhyas dwell' (Tai. A., 3.12); 'Where dwell the
ancient sages, the first-born' (Tai.Sam., 4.7.13.1); 'The supreme place
above the paradise in the heart of the Supreme Heaven' (Ma. Na., 8.14);
'He who is in the Supreme Heaven and presides over this' (Rg. S.,
8.7.17.7); 'Now that light which shines above this Supreme Heaven' (Cha.
U., 3.13.7); and 'He reaches the end of the journey, the Highest abode
of Visnu' (Ka. U., 3.9).
