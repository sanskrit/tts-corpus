18.48 So, one should not relinish one's works, understanding that they
are natural, are easy to perform and not liable to negligence. Such
thoughts coupled with the idea that there are imperfections in them
should not lead you to abandon them. The meaning is that though one is
fit for Jnana Yoga, one should perform Karma Yoga only. All enterprises,
be they of Karma or Jnana, are indeed enveloped by imperfections, by
pain, as fire by smoke. But still there is this difference: Karma Yoga
is easy and does not involve negligence, but Jnana Yoga is contrary to
this.
