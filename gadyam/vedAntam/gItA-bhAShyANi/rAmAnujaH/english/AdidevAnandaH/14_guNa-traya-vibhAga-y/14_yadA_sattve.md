14.14 When the 'Sattva prevails' i.e., while the Sattva continues to be
prevalent, if the embodies self meets with death, It reaches the pure
worlds, i.e., regions conducive to the knowledge of the self. The
purport is this: If Satva preponderates in a person at the time of
death, he will be rorn in the families of those who have the knowledge
of the self, and thus be alified to perform auspicious acts which are
the means of attaining the true knowledge of the self.
