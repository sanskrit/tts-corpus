14.7 Rajas is of the nature of passion, namely, it causes sexual desire.
'Passion' (Raga) is mutual yearning between a man and a woman.
'Springing from thirst and attachment' means it is the source of
sensuality and attachment. 'Trsna', (thirst, sensuality) is the longing
for all sense-objects, such as sound etc. 'Sanga' (attachment) is the
inordinate longing for union with one's sons, friends and such other
relations. By creating longing for actions, it binds the embodied self.
Whatever actions have been begun by the self from longiing for sensual
enjoyments, they become the cause of births in bodies that constitute
the means for experiencing such enjoyments. Therefore Rajas binds the
embodied self through attachment to actions. What is said is this: Rajas
is the cause of sexuality, sensuality and attachment, and of constant
engagement in actions.
