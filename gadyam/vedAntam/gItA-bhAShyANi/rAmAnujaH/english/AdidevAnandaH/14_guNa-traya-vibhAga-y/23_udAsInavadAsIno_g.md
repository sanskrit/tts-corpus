14.23 He who sits like one 'unconcerned,' namely, whose satisfaction
consists in the vision of the self as different from the Gunas and sits
like one unconcerned about other things and is not therefore disturbed
by the Gunas through hatred and longing and who remains iet, reflecting:
'The Gunas function in their effects like illumination etc., and so
'rests unshaken,' i.e, does not act in accordance with the effects of
the Gunas.
