14.6 Of 'these', i.e., of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, the characteristic
nature of the Sattva is this: it illuminates on account of its being
pure. What is called purity is to be bereft of alities which veil light
and happiness. Because its nature is solely the generation of light and
happiness, it constitutes the cause of light and happiness. 'Light' or
illumination is enlightenment about a thing as it is. It is 'not
morbid,' i.e., an effect called morbidity (disease) does not exist in
its presence. The meaning is, that Sattva is the cause of health. The
Guna, called Sattva, however, binds the self by attachment to happiness
and knowledge. The meaning is that it causes attachment to happiness and
knowledge. When attachment to knowledge and happiness is born, one
engages oneself in secular and Vedic means for securing them.
Conseently, one is born in such bodies which constitute the means for
realising such fruits. Hence the Sattva binds the self through
attachment to happiness and knowledge. What is said is this: Sattva
generates knowledge and happiness; again it generates attachment to
them.
