14.22 The Lord said He does not hate the effects of Sattva, Rajas and
Tamas known as illumination, activity and delusion respectively, when
they are prevailing in regard to undesired things other than the self;
nor longs for them when they cease, i.e., when desired things other than
the self become unavailable. Hating things not conducive to the
realisations of the self and longing for things conducive thereof, do
not come under this law stated in the Verse.
