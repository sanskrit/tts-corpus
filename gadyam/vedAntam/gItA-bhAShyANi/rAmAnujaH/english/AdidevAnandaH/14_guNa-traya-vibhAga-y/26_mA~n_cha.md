14.26 The state of transcendence of Gunas is not attained merely by
reflecting on the difference between the Prakrti and the self as
declared in the text such as, 'When the seer beholds no agent of action
other than the Gunas, then he transcends the Gunas, for it is liable
then to be sublated by contrary subtle impressions (Vasanas) which have
continued from beginningless time. He who, with unswerving Bhakti Yoga,
namely, one-pointed Bhakti Yoga, serves Me of true-resolve, supremely
compassionate and the ocean of parental affection for supplicants - such
a man crosses over the Gunas of Sattva etc., which are otherwise
invincible. He becomes worthy for brahmabhuya, the state of brahman
i.e., he becomes alified for the state of brahman. The meaning is that
he attains the self as It really is, immortal and immutable.
