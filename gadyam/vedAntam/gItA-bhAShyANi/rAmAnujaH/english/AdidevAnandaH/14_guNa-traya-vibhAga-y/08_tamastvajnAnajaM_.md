14.8 By 'false knowledge' is here to be understood as what is other than
knowledge. What is called knowledge is right perception of things. What
is other than this is false knowledge. And Tamas springs from knowledge
contrary to the true nature of thinngs. It deludes all embodied selves.
Delusion is erroneous knowledge. The meaning is that Tamas is the cause
of erroneous knowledge. Being the cause of negligence, indolence and
sleep, it binds the embodied self through them. 'Negligence' is
inattentiveness, which causes one to perform works other than what ought
to be done. 'Indolence' is the tendency to avoid work; it may even
develop into absolute inaction. 'Sleep.' is the state in which the
external organs stop working due to exhaustion and seek to recover from
the same. In sleep when only the outgoing actionof the senses stop, it
is called dream state. When even the mind (Manas) ceases to function, it
is called dreamless sleep. He states the cardinal feature forming the
ways of bondage through Sattva etc.
