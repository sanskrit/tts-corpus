14.18 Thus, in the manner explained, those who 'rest in Sattva rise
upwards,' namely, they attain liberation from the bonds of Samsara
gradually. Those who, 'abiding in Rajas' which produces greed for heaven
etc., engage themselves in actions which constitute the means for
obtaining such results. Experiencing those results, they are born again
and engage in, and perform, the very same acts. So they remain in the
'middle'. This is mostly suffering, as it is characterised by rirths.
Those of Tamasic nature 'stoop down' into lower levels, as Tamas grows
ever worse in them. They go 'downwards' i.e., to the lowest state among
human beings, then to the condition of animals; then to that of worms;
insects etc., then of immovable things, and even to the condition of
shrubs and creepers, and ultimately to the condition of stones, wood,
clod of earth, straw etc. Sri Krsna now teaches about the manner of
those in whom the Sattva has gradually increased by adopting special
holy food and performance of special disinterested deeds, and who thus
rise upward by transcending the Gunas.
