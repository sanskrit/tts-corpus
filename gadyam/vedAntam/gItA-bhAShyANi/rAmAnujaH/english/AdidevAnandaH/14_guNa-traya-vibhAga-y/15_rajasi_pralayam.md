14.15 (a) Meeting with death when Rajas is preponderant, one is rorn in
the families of those who act for the sake of fruits for themselves.
Being rorn in such families, he becomes alified to perform auspicious
acts which constitute the way for attaining heaven and the like. (b)
Similarly, one who dies when Tamas is preponderant is born in the wombs
of beings lacking in intelligence, namely, in the wombs of dogs, pigs
etc. The meaning is that he is rorn as one incapable of realising any
human end.
