14.3 In that great brahman forming my womb, I lay the germ. The
non-conscient Prakrti is alluded to in the text 'Earth, water, fire,
air, ether, Manas, Buddhi and Ahankara - thus My Prakrti is eightfold'
(7.4-5). This Prakrti is designated here by the name 'the great brahman'
by reason of its being the cause of modifications like the Mahat, the
Ahankara etc. In the Srutis also, here and there, even the Prakrti is
designated as brahman, as in: 'He who is all-knowing, all-wise, whose
austerity consists of knowledge - from Him are produced this brahman as
also food, i.e., the universe of name and form' (Mun. U., 1.1.9) The
higher Prakrti, which is the mass of conscient selves, alluded to in the
passage, 'Know My higher Prakrti to be distinct from this; it is the
life-principle' (7.5). It is here expressed by the term 'Garbha', the
source or womb in which all living beings originate. I lay the germ,
constituting the mass of conscious beings, in that great brahman, which
is non-conscient and forms the womb. From that conjunction between the
two Prakrtis, brought about by My will is brought forth the origin of
all entities from Brahma down to tuft to grass. He continues to say: 'I
Myself bring about the conjunction of the conscient and unconscient
Prakrtis in the manifested state of effect'.
