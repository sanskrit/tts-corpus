1.26 - 1.47 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said Sanjaya continued: The
high-minded Arjuna, extremely kind, deeply friendly, and supremely
righteous, having brothers like himself, though repeatedly deceived by
the treacherous attempts of your people like burning in the lac-house
etc., and therefore fit to be killed by him with the help of the Supreme
Person, nevertheless said, 'I will not fight.' He felt weak, overcome as
he was by his love and extreme compassion for his relatives. He was also
filled with fear, not knowing what was righteous and what unrighteous.
His mind was tortured by grief, because of the thought of future
separation from his relations. So he threw away his bow and arrow and
sat on the chariot as if to fast to death.
