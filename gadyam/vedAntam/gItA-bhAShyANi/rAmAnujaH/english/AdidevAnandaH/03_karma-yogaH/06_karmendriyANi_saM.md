3.6 He whose inner and outer organs of senses are not conered because of
his sins not being annulled but is none the less struggling for winning
knowledge of the self, whose mind is forced to turn away from the self
by reason of it being attached to sense objects, and who conseently lets
his minds dwell on them - he is called a hypocrite, because his actions
are at variance with his professions. The meaning is that by practising
the knowledge of the self in this way, he becomes perverted and lost.
