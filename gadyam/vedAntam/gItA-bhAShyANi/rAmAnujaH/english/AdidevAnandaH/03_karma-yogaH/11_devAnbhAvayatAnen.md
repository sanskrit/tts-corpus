3.11 'By this,' i.e., by this sacrifice, you propitiate the gods who
form My body and have Me as their Self. For Sri Krsna will say later on:
'For I am the only enjoyer and the only Lord of Sacrifices' (9.24).
Worshipped by sacrifices, may these gods, who have Me as their Self,
nourish you with food, drink etc., which are reired also for their
worship. Thus, supporting each other, may you attain the highest good
called Moksa (release).
