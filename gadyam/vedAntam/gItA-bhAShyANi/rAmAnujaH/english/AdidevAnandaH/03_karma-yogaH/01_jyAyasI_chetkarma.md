3.1 'Arjuna said If you consider that knowledge is superior to works,
why do you engage me in this terrible deed;' What is said here is this:
If the firm adherence to knowledge is the only means to the vision of
the self, then how can one accept the idea that devotion to works
(Karma) leads to it; It was said before that this firm devotion to
knowledge, which forms the means for the vision of the self, could arise
by the cessation of the activities of all the senses and the mind in
relation to their respective objects such as sound. If the vision of the
self is to be attained, which arises by the cessation of the activities
of the senses, I should be guided to engage myself solely to acire firm
devotion to knowledge, which is preceded by the abandoning of all works.
For what purpose, then, do you engage me in this terrible deed, which
consists in the activities of all the senses, and is thus an obstacle
for the vision of the self;
