3.35 Therefore Karma Yoga is better than Jnana Yoga. For, it forms one's
own duty, since it is natural to one and easy to perform, and though
defective, is free from liability to interruption and fall. Jnana Yoga,
on the other hand, though performed well for some time, constitutes the
duty of another, as it is difficult to practise for one conjoined with
Prakrti. It is therefore liable to interruption. For a person who lives
practising Karma Yoga - which is his duty because he is alified for it -
even death without success in one birth does not matter. For, in the
next birth with the help of the experience already gained in the
previous birth, it will be possible for him to perform Karma Yoga
without any impediments. Jnana Yoga is fraught with fear because of the
possibility of errors for anyone who is conjoined to Prakrti. It is
another's duty, on account of it being not easily adoptable by him.
