3.27 It is the Gunas of Prakrti like Sattva, Rajas etc., that perform
all the activities appropriate to them. But the man, whose nature is
deluded by his Ahankara, thinks, 'I am the doer of all these actions.'
Ahankara is the mistaken conception of 'I' applied to the workings of
Prakrti which is not the 'I'. The meaning is that it is because of this
(Ahankara), that one who is ignorant of the real nature of the self,
thinks, 'I am the doer' with regard to the activities that are really
being done by the Gunas of Prakrti.
