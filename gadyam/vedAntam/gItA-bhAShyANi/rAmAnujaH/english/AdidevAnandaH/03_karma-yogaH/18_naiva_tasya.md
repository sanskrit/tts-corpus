3.18 Thus, for such a one there is no purpose, i.e., nothing to be
gained from work done as a means for the vision of the self, nor is he
subject to any evil or calamity from work left undone, because his
vision of the self does not rest on any external means. To such a person
who has turned by himself away from non-intelligent matter which is
different from the self, there is nothing acceptable as a purpose to be
gained from the constituents of Prakrti and their products; only if
there were such a purpose, there would be the need for the means of
retreat therefrom. For, the adoption of the means is only for effecting
such a retreat. But he is verily liberated. Non-pursuit of the means for
vision of the self is only for that person whose vision of the self no
longer depends on any means. But Karma Yoga is better in gaining the
vision of the self for one who is in pursuit of the means for that
vision, because it is easy to perfom, because it is secure from possible
error, because the contemplation of the true nature of the self is
included in it, and because even for a Jnana Yogin the performance of
minimum activity is necessary. For these reasons, Karma Yoga is better
as a means for the vision of the Atman.
