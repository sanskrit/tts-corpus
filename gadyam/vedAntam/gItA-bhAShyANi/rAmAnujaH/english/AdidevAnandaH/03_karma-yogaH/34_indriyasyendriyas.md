3.34 An unavoidable attraction has been fixed for organs of sense like
ear towards the objects like sound, and for organs of action like that
of tongue towards their objects like tasty food. This longing is in the
form of desire to experience these objects, which is caused by old
subtle impressions. When their experience is thwarted, an unavoidable
aversion is experienced. Thus, these two, attachment and aversion, bring
under their control one who aspires to follow Jnana Yoga, and forcibly
engage him in actions appropriate to them, in spite of his having
established some sort of control over the senses. Such an aspirant fails
to get the experience of the self, and therefore becomes completely
lost. So no one practising Jnana Yoga should come under the sway of
attachment and aversion, which are ruinous. These two, attachment and
aversion, are indeed his unconerable foes that deter him from the
practice of Jnana Yoga.
