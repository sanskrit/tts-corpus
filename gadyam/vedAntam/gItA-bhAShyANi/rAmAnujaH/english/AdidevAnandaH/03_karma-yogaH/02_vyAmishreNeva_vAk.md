3.2 Conseqently, it appears to me as if 'you confuse me with statements
that seem to contradict each other.' For, firm devotion to knowledge
which forms the means for the vision of the self and which is of the
nature of stopping the operations of the senses on the one hand, and on
the other exhortation to action which is of a nature opposite to it,
i.e., knowledge, as a means to the same vision of that Atman - these
statements are contradictory and confusing. Therefore tell me clearly
the path following which I can take a determined course and win the
Supreme Being.
