3.23 If I, the Lord of all, whose will is always true, whose sport
consists in creation, sustentation and dissolution of universe at My
will, even though I am born at My pleasure as a man to help the world -
if, I thus incarnating in the family of Vasudeva who is the foremost
among virtuous men, did not contine to work unwearied at all times
suitable to that family, then, these men with incomplete knowledge would
follow My path, thinking that the way adopted by the son of virtuous
Vasudeva alone is the real way. And in place of winning the self, they
would go to Naraka because of their failure to do what ought to be done
and also because of the sin arising from non-performance of duty.
