3.26 Do not bewilder the minds of ignorant aspirants by saying that
there is, besides Karma Yoga, another way to the vision of the self.
They cannot practise Jnana Yoga on account of their incomplete knowledge
of the self, and attachment to action. They are alified for Karma Yoga
because of their being fit only for activity on account of the subtle
impressions of their beginningless Karma. What then follows from this;
It is this: Even though one is alified for Jnana Yoga because of the
complete knowledge of the self, one should do work, holding the view as
said previously, that Karma Yoga by itself without Jnana Yoga is an
independent means for the vision of the self. He should thus generate
love for all types of activity among those who do not know the complete
truth. Sri Krsna declares (in the verses 27 to 30) the way in which the
self is to be contemplated on as not being an agent as reired by Karma
Yoga, after demonstrating the difference between the enlightened and
unenlightened among those practising Karma Yoga.
