3.15 Here ther term, 'Brahman' connotes the physical body consisting of
modifications of the Prakrti; for the Prakrti is denoted here by the
term 'Brahman', as in the scriptural text: 'From Him arises, this
Brahman and this 'Brahman' becomes name, form and food' (Mun. U.,
1.1.9). Here also it will be said by Sri Krsna: 'This great 'Brahman' is
my womb' (14.3). Therefore, the words that 'Activity springs from
'Brahman' teaches that activity is produced by the physical body which
is of the nature of the modification of Prakrti. The 'Brahman' arises
from the imperishable self. Here the term, 'imperishable', indicates the
individual self. The physical body, which is inhabited by the self who
is satisfied by food and drink, is fit for action; hence the physical
body which constitutes the instrument of activity is said to be from the
imperishable. Therefore the 'all-pervading Brahman' means here the
bodies of all persons of diverse kinds which are the products of Prakrti
which comprises all material entities, and is hence all-pervading. They,
the bodies, are established in sacrifice. The meanig is that the bodies
have roots in sacrifice.
