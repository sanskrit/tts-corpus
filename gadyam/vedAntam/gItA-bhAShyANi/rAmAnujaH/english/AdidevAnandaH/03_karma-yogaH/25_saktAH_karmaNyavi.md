3.25 'The ignorant' are those people who do not know the entire truth
about the self; 'attached to their work' means they are inseparably
yoked to work. Because of their incomplete knowledge of the self, they
are not alified for Jnana Yoga which is of the nature of practising
knowledge of the self. They are alified for Karma Yoga only. As they
should practise Karma Yoga for the vision of the self in the same manner
Karma Yoga should be practised by one who is recognised as virtuous, who
is unattached to work by reason of the vision of the self, and who
wishes that his conduct should give guidance to others in virtuous
conduct. In this way he should protect the world from chaos by his
example. Such a person, even though alified for Jnana Yoga, should
practice Karma Yoga.
