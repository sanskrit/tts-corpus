3.31 There are those persons who are alified to understand the Sastras
and decide for themselves what is My doctrine, and follow them
accordingly; there are others who are full of faith in the meaning of
the Sastras without however practising it. And there are still others
who, even though devoid of faith, do not cavil at it, saying that the
true meaning of the Sastras cannot be this, i.e., they do not find any
blemish pertaining to the Sastras which possess great alities. All these
persons are freed from Karmas which are there from beginningless time
and which cause bondage. By the term, api (even) in 'te pi karmabhih'
('even they from Karmas'), these men are divided into three groups. The
meaning is that those who, even if they do not act upon the meaning but
still believe in this meaning of the Sastras and do not cavil at it,
will be cleansed of their evil by their faith and freedom from
fault-finding. For, if they have faith they will, before long, take to
the practice of this very meaning of the Sastras and be freed. Sri Krsna
now speaks of the evil that will befall those who do not practice this
instruction of the Upanisads, i.e., those who are faithless and who
cavil at it.
