3.17 But for him, who is not in need of the means of Jnana Yoga and
Karma Yoga, who finds delight in the self on his own, i.e., who is
established in the self, who is satisfied by the self alone and not by
food, drink and other things which are other than the self, who rejoices
in the self alone and not in pleasure gardens, garlands, sandalpaste,
vocal and instrumental music etc., and for whom everything, his
subsistence, nourishment and enjoyment, is the self alone - for him
nothing remains to be performed for the vision of the self, because the
essential nature of the self is perpetually in his unaided vision.
