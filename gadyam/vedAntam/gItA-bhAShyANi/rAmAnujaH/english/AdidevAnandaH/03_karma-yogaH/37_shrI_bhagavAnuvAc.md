3.37 The Lord said The highly ravenous desire is born of the Guna Rajas
originating from old subtle impressions. It has for its objects sound
and other sense contacts. It is a foe to him who is practising Jnana
Yoga, as he is joined with Prakrti constituted of the Gunas which rise
and subside periodically. It attracts him towards the objects of the
senses. It is this desire alone which, when hampered, develops into
anger towards those persons who are the cause of such hindrance. It is a
powerful cause of sin. It incites the aspirant to do harm to others.
Know this, which is born of the Guna called Rajas, as the natural enemy
of Jnana Yogins.
