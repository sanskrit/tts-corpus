3.42 The senses are called the important obstacles of knowledge, because
when the senses keep operating on their objects, the knowledge of the
self cannot arise. 'The mind is higher than the senses': even if the
senses are withdrawn, if the Manas (mind) ruminates over sense objects,
knowledge of the self cannot be had. 'The intellect (Buddhi) is greater
than the mind', i.e., even if the mind is indifferent to sense objects,
a perverted decision by the intellect can obstruct the dawn of the
knowledge of the self. But even if all of them upto the intellect are
ietened from their activity, still when desire, identified with will,
originating from Rajas, is operating, it by itself obstructs the
knowledge of the self by inducing the senses etc., to operate in their
fields. Thus it is said here: 'But what is greater than intellect is
that.' What is greater than the intellect - is desire. Such is the sense
of the last sentence here.
