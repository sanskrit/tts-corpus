3.14 From food arise all beings; from rain food is produced. These two
facts are matters of common experience. 'From sacrifice comes rain' this
is known from the scriptures such as, 'The oblations offered in fire
reach the sun, and from the sun comes rain' (Manu, 6.76), and sacrifice
is born out of activities in the form of collecting materials, etc., by
the agent. And activity arises from 'Brahman', the body born of Prakrti.
