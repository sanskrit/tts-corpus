3.20 It is also declared that Karma Yoga alone Janaka and others reached
perfection. Because, Karma Yoga is the best means for securing the
vision of the self even for a person who is alified for Jnana Yoga,
royal sages like Janaka and others, who are foremost among the Jnanins,
preferred Karma Yoga as the means for attaining perfection. Thus, having
first declared previously that Karma Yoga must be practised by an
aspirant for release who is alified for Karma Yoga alone, as he is unfit
for Jnana Yoga, it was next stated with reasons that, even for one who
is alified for Jnana Yoga, Karma Yoga is better than Jnana Yoga Now it
is going to be declared (in verses 20-26) that Karma Yoga must be
performed in every way by one who is virtuous. At least for the guidance
of the world, you should do work even if there is no need of it for
yourself.
