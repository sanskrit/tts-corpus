3.24 If I do not do the work suitable to My station in life, likewise
all the virtuous men also, neglecting their duties by following My
example, would be destroyed on account of not performing their duties.
That is, they will become lost. Thus I would be bringing about chaos
among all virtuous men on account of My failure to conduct Myself as
prescribed in the scriptures. Therefore I would be destroying all these
people. Even so, if you, Arjuna, a son of Pandu and a brother of
Yudhisthira and the foremost of the virtuous, claim to be qualified for
Jnana Yoga, then the virtuous aspirants, who do not know everything and
who follow your way, without knowing their own competency, would give up
practising Karma Yoga and will be lost. Therefore work should be done by
one who is recognised as learned and worthy.
