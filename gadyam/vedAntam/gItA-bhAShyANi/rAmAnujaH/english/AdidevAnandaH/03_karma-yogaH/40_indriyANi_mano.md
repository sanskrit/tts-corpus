3.40 The senses, the mind and the intellect are the instruments of
desire in so far as it overpowers the self through them. By means of
these, viz., the senses, the mind and the intellect, which have been
reduced to the position of servants through attachment to sense objects,
desire deludes the embodied soul caught up in Prakrti by covering up Its
knowledge. Here 'deluding' means making the self a victim of manifold
illusions, by turning It away from the knowledge of Its true nature, and
making It indulge in sensuous experiences.
