3.22 For Me, who is the Lord of all, who has all desires fulfilled, who
is omniscient, whose will is always true, and who, at My own will,
remains in the three worlds in the forms of gods, men and such other
beings, there is nothing whatever to achieve. Therefore though there is
for Me nothing 'unacired', i.e., nothing yet to be acired by work, I go
on working for the protection of the world.
