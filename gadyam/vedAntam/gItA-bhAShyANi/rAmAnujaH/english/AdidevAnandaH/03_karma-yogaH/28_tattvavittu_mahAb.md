3.28 But he who knows the truth about the divisions of the Gunas and
their actions - namely, about the division among Sattva etc., on the one
hand, and the divisions among their respective functionings on the other
hand - it is he who, realising that Gunas, i.e., Sattva etc., are
operating on their own products, is not attached to the actions of the
Gunas, being convinced, 'I am not the doer.'
