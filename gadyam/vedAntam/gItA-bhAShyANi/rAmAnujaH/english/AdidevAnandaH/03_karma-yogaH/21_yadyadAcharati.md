3.21 Whatever 'an eminent man,' i.e., he, who is famous for his
knowledge of all the scriptures and for his observance of the scriptural
dictates, performs, others who have incomplete knowledge of the
scriptures will also perform, following his example. With regard to any
duty which is being performed with all its ancillaries by an eminent
personage, the people with incomplete knowledge will do it with the same
ancillaries. Therefore for the protection of the world, all acts that
are appropriate to one's station and stage in life must always be
performed by an eminent man who is distinguished for his wisdom.
Otherwise, the evil generated from the ruin of the large masses of the
world (who neglect their duties by following his example), will bring
him down, even if he were a follower of pure Jnana Yoga.
