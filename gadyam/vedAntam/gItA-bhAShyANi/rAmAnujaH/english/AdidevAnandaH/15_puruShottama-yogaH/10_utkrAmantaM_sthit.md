15.10 The deluded do not perceive the Atman (self) as a form of
knowledge separate from Its human and other configurations which are
particular transformations of Prakrti, with which the self is conjoined
when It is in embodied condition, experiencing the objects of the
senses. The self also departs from the body when the body dies and
assumes another body. The deluded or those who misconceive the body as
the self do not understand all this. However, those who possess the eye
of knowledge, i.e., have the knowledge concerning the difference between
the body and the self, perceive the self as having a form different from
the body in all conditions.
