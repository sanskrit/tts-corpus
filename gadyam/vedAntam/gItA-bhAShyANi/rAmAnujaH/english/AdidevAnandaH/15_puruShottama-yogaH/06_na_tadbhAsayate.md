15.6 The sun cannot illumine the light of the self, nor moon, nor fire.
For, knowledge is indeed that which illumines them all. External lights,
however, are helpful only in removing the darkness which hinders the
contact between the senses and the objects. It is the intelligence of
the self that reveals such external lights. What reveals this (i.e., the
self) is Yoga (i.e., meditation) only. Beginningless Karma is the
hindrance. It has been taught that the way for the erasing of Karma is
self-surrender to the Lord through detachment etc. That supreme light,
reaching which they do not return any more is the self, which is My
glory (Vibhuti) and therefore belongs to Me and is a part of Myself.
Such is the meaning. The supremacy of this light (i.e., individual self)
consists in its capacity to illumine the light of knowledge. Knowledge
alone can illuminate all things (including the light of the sun which
sheds only physical light on objects.).
