15.14 Becoming the 'digestive fire', or the fire of digestion, I
function within the bodies of all living creatures. In union with
various activities of 'inward and outward breaths', I digest the 'four
kinds of food' eaten by individuals. These consist of foods to be
chewed, sucked, licked and drunk. The Supreme Person who has the Soma,
digestive fire etc., as his glory (Vibhuti) is here eated with Him by
means of co-ordinate predication in the verses 'Becoming the juicy Soma'
and 'Becoming the digestive fire'. He now sets forth the reason for
eating these glories with Himself.
