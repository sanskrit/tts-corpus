15.20 Thus, this Sastra, the most mysterious of all mysteries and which
teaches My aspect as the Supreme Person, has been imparted to you by Me,
as you are worthy to receive it because you are sinless. By
understanding this, a man will become truly wise and will have fulfilled
his duty. Whatever wisdom has to be cultivated for attaining Me, all
that should be taken as cultivated and that whatever duty has to be
fulfilled in that connection - all that is to be taken as fulfilled by
knowing this (the Purusottama Vidya). He gets all spiritual fulfilment
by this knowledge, except the direct vision of Purusottama. \[Probably
the idea is that direct vision comes only when the body falls at the end
of the antum of Karma that has brought it into existence. Before that
only the state of the Sthitaprajna can be attained. The thin veil of
residual Karma still stands in the way.\]
