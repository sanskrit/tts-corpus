notions conerning the self', namely, become free from the delusion in
the form of misconceiving the non-self (body) as the self; 'victorious
over the evil of attachment', namely, victorious over the evil known as
attachment to sense-objects consisting of the Gunas; 'ever devoted to
self', namely completely absorbed in the knowledge of the self which is
called Adhyatma or knowledge about the self; when they have 'turned away
from desires' other than this self-knowledge; when they are liberated
from 'dualities called pleasure and pain' - such 'undeluded souls',
namely, those who are able to discern the natures of self and non-self,
attain to that 'imperishable status'. They attain the self as It is, in
the form of infinite knowledge. Conseently for those who seek refuge in
Me, all actions become easy of performance till perfection is attained
by My grace.
