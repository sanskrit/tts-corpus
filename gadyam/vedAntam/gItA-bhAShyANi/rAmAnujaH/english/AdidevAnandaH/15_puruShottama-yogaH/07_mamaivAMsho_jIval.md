15.7 That self, whose nature has been described thus, though
constituting an everlasting part of Myself, becomes the bound individual
self in the world of life. Covered by ignorance in the form of
beginningless Karma, It attracts to Itself the five senses and the mind,
which are located in the bodies of gods, men etc., and which are
particular transformations of Prakrti. Some parts of Myself (i.e., the
selves), becoming free from ignorance (Avidya) in the aforesaid manner,
remain in their own intrinsic nature. But the bound individual self is
very much contracted in power and knowledge. The individual self is the
lord of the senses and the mind in bodies, and forms a bound individual
in combination with a particular transformation of the Prakrti through
Karma. Thus Karma attracts the selves hither and thither according to
its nature.
