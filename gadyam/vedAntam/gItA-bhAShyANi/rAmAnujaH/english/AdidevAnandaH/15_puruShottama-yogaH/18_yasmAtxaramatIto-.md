15.18 Inasmuch as I transcend the perishable (i.e., bound) Person of the
aforesaid nature, and I am higher, for reasons stated earlier, than the
imperishable Person or liberated self, therefore I am styled the Supreme
Person in the Smrti and Srutis. The Smrti is called Loka by reason of
its leading to the meaning of the Vedas. The meaning is that I am famous
in the Srutis and in the Smrti. In the Sruti for instance; 'Reaching the
Supreme Light, it appears in its own nature. He is the Supreme Person'
(Cha. U., 8.12.3). In the Smrti we have texts like 'I will approach Him
(Sri Krsna), the Supreme Person who is the incarnation of a portion of
Visnu, who is without beginning, middle or end' (V. P., 5.17.33).
