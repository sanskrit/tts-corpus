8.14 Partha, O son of Prtha, tasya yoginah, to that yogi;
nitya-yuktasya, of constant concentration, who is ever absorbed (in
God); and ananya-cetah, of single-minded attention, a yogi whose mind is
not drawn to any other object; yah, who; smarati, remembers; mam, Me,
the supreme God; satatam, uninteruptedly; and nityasah, for long-. By
satatam, uninterrupteldy, is meant 'without any break'. By niryasah, is
meant along duration. Not six months, nor even a year! What then; The
meaning is: He who remembers Me for his whole life, continuously. To
that yogi aham, I; am sulabhah, easy of attainment. Since this is so,
therefore one should remain ever absorbed in Me, with mind given to
nothing else. 'What follows from Your being easy of attainment;' This is
being answered: 'Hear what follows from My being easy of attainment.'
