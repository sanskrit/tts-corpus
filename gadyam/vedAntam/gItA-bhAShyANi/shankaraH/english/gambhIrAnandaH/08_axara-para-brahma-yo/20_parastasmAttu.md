8.20 He is parah, distinct, different;-From what;-tasmat, from that
aforesaid (Unmanifested). The word tu, but, is meant for showing the
distinction of the Immutable that is going to be spoken of from the
Unmanifested. He is bhavah, the Reality, the supreme Brahman called the
Immutable. Even though different, there is the possibility of
similarlity of characteristics. Hence, for obviating this the Lord says:
anyah, the other, of a different characteristic, and He is the Immutable
which is beyond the range of the organs. It has been said that He is
distinct from that. From what, again is He distinct; Avyaktat, from the
Unmaifested spoken of earlier, which is the seed of the multitude of
beings, and which is characterized as ignorance (avidya) \[Ast. adds,
'anyah vilaksanah, bhavah ityabhiprayah: The meaning is that the Reality
is different and distinct (form that Unmanifested).-Tr.\] He is
sanatnah, eternal. Bhavah, the Reality; yah sah, who is such; na, does
not; vinasyati, get destroyed; when sarvesu bhutesu, all beings,
beginning from Brahma; nasyatsu, get destroyed.
