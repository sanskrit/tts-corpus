8.4 Adhibhutam, that which exists in the physical plane, i.e. that which
exists by comprising all creatures;-what is it;-it consists of the
ksarah bhavah, mutable entity. Ksarah is that which is mutable, which is
destructible; bhavah means anything whatsoever that has orgination. This
is meaning. Purusah means the Person, derived in the sense of he by whom
all things are pervaded; or, he who lies in every heart. He is
Hiranyagarbha, who resides in the Sun and sustains the organs of all
creatures. He is adhi-daivatam, the entity existing in the divine plane.
Deha-bhrtam-vara, O best among the embodied beings; adhiyajnah, the
entity existing in sacrifices, is the Deity, called Visnu, presiding
over all sacrifices-which agrees with the Vedic text, 'Sacrifice is
indeed Vishu' (Tai, Sam. 1.7.4). Aham eva, I Myself, who am that very
Visnu; am adhiyajnah, the entity existing in the sacrifice; which is
going on atra dehe, in this body. Since a sacrfice is performed with
body, therefore it is closely associated with the body. In this sense it
is said to be going on in the body.
