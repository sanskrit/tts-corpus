13.2 The Lord specifies the body as the object referred to by the
pronoun idam (this). O son of Kunti, (this body) abhidhiyate, is
referred to; ksetram iti, as the field-because it is protected (tra)
against injury (ksata), or because it perishes (ksi), wastes away
(ksar), or because the results of actions get fulfilled in the body as
in a field (ksetra). The word iti is used in the sense of 'as'.
They-who;-tadvidah, who are versed in this, who know the 'field' and the
'knower of the field'; ahuh, call; tam, him, the knower; yah, who; vetti
etat, is concious of, knows, it, the body, the field-makes it, from head
to foot, an abject of his knowledge; makes it an object of perception as
a separate entity, through knowledg which is spontaneous or is acired
through instruction; ksetrajna iti, as the knower of the field. As
before, the word iti is used in the sense of 'as'. They call him as the
knower of the field. Is it that the field and the knower of the field
thus mentioned are to be understood through this much knowledge only;
The answer is, no.
