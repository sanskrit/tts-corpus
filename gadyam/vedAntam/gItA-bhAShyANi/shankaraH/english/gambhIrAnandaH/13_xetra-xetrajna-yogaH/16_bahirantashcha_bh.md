13.16 Existing, bahih, outside- the word bahih is used with reference to
the body including the skin, which is misconceived through ignorance to
be the Self, and which is itself taken as the boundary. Similarly, the
word antah, inside, is used with reference to the indwelling Self,
making the body itself as the boundary. When 'outside' and 'inside' are
used, there may arise the contingency of the nonexistence of That in the
middle. Hence this is said: acaram caram eva ca, moving as well as not
moving-even that which appears as the body, moving or not moving, is
nothing but the Knowable, in the same way as the appearance of a snake
on a rope (is nothing but the rope). In all empirical things, moving as
also non-moving, be the Knowable, why should It not be known by all as
such; In answer it is said: It is true that It shines through
everything; still it is subtle like space. Therefore, although It is the
Knowable, tat, It; is avijneyam, incomprehensible to the ignorant
people; suksmatvat, due to Its intrinsic subtleness. But to the
enlightened It is ever known from the valid means of knowledge such as
(the texts), 'All this is verily the Self' (Ch. 7.25.2), 'Brahman alone
is all this' (Nr. Ut.7), etc. It is durastham, far away, since, to the
unenlightened, It is unattainable even in millions of years. And tat,
That; is antike, near, since It is the Self of the enlightened.
