13.18 Tat, that Knowable; is the jyotih, Light; api, even; jyotisam, of
the lights-of the sun etc. For the lights like the sun etc. shine
because they are enkindled by the light of consciousness of the Self, as
is known from Upanisadic texts like, 'Illumined by whose light the sun
shines' (Tai. Br. 3.12.9.7), 'By Its light all this shines variously'
(Sv. 6.14), and from the Smrti also, as here (in the Gita) itself: 'That
light in the sun৷৷.' (15.12), etc. It is ucyate, spoken of as; param,
beyond, untouched by; tamasah, darkness; ignorance. For cheering up
anyone who may become disheartened by thinking that Knowledge etc. is
difficult to attain, the Lord says: It is jnanam, Knowledge-humility
etc. (verse 7, etc.); jneyam, the Knowable, which has been spoken of in,
'I shall speak of that which is to be known' (12); and jnana-gamyam, the
Known. The Knowable itself is referred to as jnanagamyam, when after
being known, It becomes the result of Knowledge. But when It is an
object to be known, It is called jneyam. All these three which are such,

sarvasya, of all, of all creatures. For these three are, indeed,
perceived there. This verse is begun for concluding the topic under
