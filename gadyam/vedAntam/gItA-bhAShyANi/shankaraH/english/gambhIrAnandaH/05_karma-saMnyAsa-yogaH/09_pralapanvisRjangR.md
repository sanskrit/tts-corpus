5.9 Yuktah, remaining absorbed in the Self; tattva-vit, the knower of
Reality-knower of the real nature of Truth, of the Self, i.e., the seer
of the supreme Reality; manyeta, should think; 'na karomi eva, I
certainly do not do; kincit, anything.' Having realized the Truth, when
or how should he think; This is being answered; Api, even; pasyan, while
seeing; srnvan, hearing; sprsan, touching; jighran, smelling; asnan,
eating; gacchan, moving; svapan, sleeping; svasan, breathing; pralapan,
speaking; visrjan, releasing; grhnan, holding; unmisan, opening;
nimisan, closing the eyes. All these are to be connected with the above
manyeta (should think). For the man who has known the Truth thus, who
finds nothing but inaction in action-in all the movements of the body
and organs-, and who has full realization, there is competence only for
giving up all actions because of his realization of the nonexistence of
actions. Indeed, one who proceeds to drink water in a mirage thinking
that water is there, surely does not go there itself for drinking water
even after knowing that no water exists there!
