5.6 Tu, but, O mighty-armed one; sannyasah, renunciation, in the real
sense; duhkham aptum, is hard to attain; ayogatah, without (Karma-)
yoga. Munih, the meditative man-the word muni being derived in the sense
of one who meditates on the real nature of God; yoga-yuktah, eipped with
yoga, with Vedic Karma-yoga in the form of dedication to God without
thought of results (for oneself); adhigacchati, attains; brahma,
Brahman; na cirena, without delay, very ickly. Therefore it was said by
Me, 'Karma-yoga excels'. \[Karma-yoga leads to enlightenment through the
stages of attenuation of attachment, withdrawal of the internal and
external organs from their objects, and their inclination towards the
indwelling Self. (Also see Commentary on 5.12).\] The monasticism under
discussion is called Brahman because it leads to knowledge of the
supreme Self, as stated in the Upanisad, 'Nyasa (monasticism) is
Brahman. Brahman is verily the supreme' (Ma. Na. 21.2) Brahman means
monasticism in the real sense, consisting in steadfastness to the
knowledge of the supreme Self.
