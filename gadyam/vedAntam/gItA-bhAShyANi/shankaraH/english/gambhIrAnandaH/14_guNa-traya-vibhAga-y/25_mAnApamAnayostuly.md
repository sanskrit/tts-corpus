14.25 Further, tulyah, he who is the same, unperturbed; mana-apamanayoh,
under honour and dishonour; tulyah, who is eally disposed;
mitra-ari-paksayoh, both towards the side of the friend and of the
foe-although from their own standpoint some may be unattached, still, in
others' view they may appear to be siding either with friends or foes;
hence it is said, 'eally disposed both towards the side of the friend
and of the foe'; sarva-arambha-parityagi, who has renounced all
enterprise (-those which are undertaken are arambhah, actions intended
for seen or unseen results-), i.e. who is apt to give up all
undertakings, who has given up all actions other than those needed
merely for the maintenance of the body; sah, he; ucyate, is said to
have; gunatitah, gone beyond the alities. The disciplines leading to the
state of transcendence of the alities, which have been stated (in the
verses) beginning from 'he who, sitting like one indifferent,' and
ending with 'he is said to have gone beyond the alities,' have to be
practised by a monk, a seeker of Liberation, so long as they are to be
achieved through effort. But when they become firmly ingrained, they
become the indications, perceivable to himself, of a monk who has
transcended the alities. Now the Lord gives the reply to the estion,
'And how does he transcend the alties;'
