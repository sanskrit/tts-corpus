14.23 He, the Self-realized monk, yah, who; asinah, sitting; udasinavat,
like one indifferent-as an indifferent man sides with nobody, similarly,
this one, set on the path leading to the transcendence of the alities;
na, is not; vicalyate, distracted from the state of Knowledge arising
out of discrimination; gunaih, by the alities. This point is being
clarified as such: Yah, he who; thinking iti, that; gunah, the alities,
which have trasnformed into body, organs and objects; vartante, act on
one another; avatisthati, remains firm-avatisthati (instead of
avatisthate) is used in the Parasmaipada to avoid a break in the metre,
or there is different reading, 'yah anutisthati, who acts'-;\[His
apparent activity consists in the mere continuance of actions which have
been subjectively sublated through enlightenment.\] and an, does not;
ingate, move; i.e., becomes eva, surely settled in his own nature-.
