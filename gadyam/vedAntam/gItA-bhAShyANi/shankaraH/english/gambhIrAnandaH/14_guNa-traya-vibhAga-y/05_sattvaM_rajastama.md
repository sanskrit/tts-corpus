14.5 O mighty-armed one-who are possessed of hands which are great and
mighty, and extend upto the knees, gunah, the alities are named sattva,
rajas and tamas. And they, prakrti-sambhavah, born of Nature, born of
Maya which belongs to God; nibadhnanti, bind, as it were; the avyayam,
immutable-the immutability has been spoken of in the verse, 'Being
without beginning৷৷.,' etc. (13.31); dehinam, embodied being; dehe, to
the body. The word guna is a technical term, and is not a ality like
colour etc. which inhere in some substance. Nor is it meant here that
ality and substance are different. Therefore they are ever dependent on
the Knower of the field, just as alities are dependent (on some
substance). Being of the nature of ignorance, they bind the Knower of
the field, as it were. They come into being, making That (Knower) their
sustainer. In this sense it is said that they bind. Objection; Was it
not said that the embodied one does not become defiled (see 13.31-2);
So, why as it contrarily said here that 'they bind'; Reply: We have
rutted this objection by using the word iva (as it were) in 'they bind,
as it were'.
