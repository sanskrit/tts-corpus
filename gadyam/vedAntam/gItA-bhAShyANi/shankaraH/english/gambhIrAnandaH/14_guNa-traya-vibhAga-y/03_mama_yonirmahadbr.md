14.3 Mama, My own Maya, i.e. Prakrti consisting of the three alities,
which belongs to Me; is the yonih, womb \[Here Ast. adds 'karanam,
cause' (-off all the creatures).-Tr.\] for all the creatures. Since it
(Prakrti) is great (mahat) as compared with all its effects, and it is
the sustainer (brahma) \[Prakrti is brahma since it permeates all of its
own products.-A.G.\] of all its own transformations, therefore the womb
itself is alified as mahat brahma. Tasmin, in that, in the womb which is
the great-sustainer; aham, I, God, possessed of the power in the form of
the two aspects, viz the field and the Knower of the field; dadhami,
place, deposit; garbham, the seed-the seed of the birth of
Hiranayagarbha, te seed which is the cause of the birth of all things-;
i.e., I bring the field into association with the Knower of the field
who conforms to the nature of the limiting adjuncts, viz ignorance,
desire and activity. Tatah, from that, from that deposition of the seed;
O scion of the Bharata dynasty, bhavati, occurs; sambhavah, the birth,
origination; sarva-bhutanam, of all things, following the birth of
Hiranyagarbha.
