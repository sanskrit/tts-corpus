7.30 Ye, those who; viduh, know; mam, Me; sa-adhi-bhuta-adhidaivam, as
existing in the physical and the divine planes; ca, and also;
sa-adhiyajnam, as existing in the context of the sacrifice; te, they;
yukta-cetasah, of concentrated minds-those who have their minds absorbed
in God; viduh, know; mam, Me; api ca, even; prayanakale, at the time of
death. \[For those who are devoted to God, there is not only the
knowledge of Brahman as identified with all individuals and all actions
(see previous verse), but also the knowledge of It as existing in all
things on the physical, the divine and the sacrificial planes. Those who
realize Brhaman as existing in the context of all the five, viz of the
individual, of actions, of the physical,of the divine, and of the
sacrifices-for them with such a realization there is no forgetting, loss
of awareness, of Brahman even at the critical moment of death.\]
