7.22 Yuktah,being endued; taya, with that; sraddhaya, faith, as granted
by Me; sah, that person; ihate, engages in; radhanam, i.e. aradhanam,
worshipping; tasyah, that form of the deity. And labhate, he gets; tan
hi, those very; kaman, desired results; tatah, there-from, from that
form of the deity which was worshipped; as vihitan, they are dispensed,
meted out; maya eva, by Me alone, who am the omniscient, supreme God,
because I am possessed of the knowledge of the apportionment of the
results of actions. The meaning his that he surely gets those desired
results since they are ordained by God. If the reading be hitan (instead
of hi tan), then the beneficence (-hita means beneficent-) of the
desired result should be interpreted in a figurative sense, for desires
cannot be beneficial to anyone!
