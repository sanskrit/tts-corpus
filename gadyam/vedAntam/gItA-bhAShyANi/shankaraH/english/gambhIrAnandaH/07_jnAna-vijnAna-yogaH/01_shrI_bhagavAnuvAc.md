7.1 O Partha, mayi asaktamanah, having the mind fixed on Me- one whose
mind (manah) is fixed (asakta) on Me (mayi) who am the supreme God
possessed on the alification going to be spoken of-. Yogam yunjan,
practising the Yoga of Meditation, concentrating the mind-. Madasrayah,
taking refuge in Me-one to whom I Myself, the supreme Lord, am the
refuge (asraya) is madasrayah-. Anyone who hankers after some human
objective resorts to some rite such as the Agnihotra etc., austerity or
charity, which is the means to its attainment. This yogi, however,
accepts only Me as his refuge; rejecting any other means, he keeps his
mind fixed on Me alone. Srnu, hear; tat, that, which is being spoken of
by Me; as to yatha, how, the process by which; you who, having become
thus, jnasyasi, will know; mam, Me; asamsayam, with certainty, without
doubt, that the Lord is such indeed; and samagram, in fullness,
possessed of such alities as greatness, strength, power, majesty, etc.
\[Strength-physical; power-mental; etc. refers to omniscience and
will.\] in their fullness.
