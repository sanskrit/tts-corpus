7.8 Kaunteya, O son of Kunti, aham, I; am rasah, the taste, which is the
essence of water. The idea is that water is depedent on Me who am its
essence. This is how it is to be understood in every case. Just as I am
the essence of water, similarly, asmi, I am; the prabha, effulgence;
sasi-suryayoh, of the moon and the sun; pranavah, (the letter) Om;
sarva-vedesu, in all the Vedas. All the Vedas are established on Me who
am that Om. So also (I am) sabdah, the sound; khe, in space, as the
essence. Space is established on Me who am that (sound). In the same
way, nrsu, in men; (I am) paurusam, manhood- the ality of being man,
from which arises the idea of manhood. Men are established on Me who am
such.
