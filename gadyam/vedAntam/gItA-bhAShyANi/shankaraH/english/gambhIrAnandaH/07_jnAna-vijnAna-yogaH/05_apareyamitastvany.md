7.5 O mighty-armed one, iyam, this; is apara, the inferior (Prakrti)-not
the higher, (but)-the impure, the source of evil and having the nature
of worldly bondage. Viddhi, know; anyam, the other, pure; prakrtim,
Prakrti; me, of Mine, which is essentially Myself; which, tu, however;is
param, higher, more exalted; itah, than this (Prakrti) already spoken
of; Jiva-bhutam, which has taken the form of the individual souls, which
is characterized as 'the Knower of the body (field)', and which is the
cause of sustenance of life; and yaya, by which Prakriti; idam, this;
jagat, world; dharyate, is upheld, by permeating it.
