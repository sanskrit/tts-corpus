7.9 I am also the punyah, sweet; gandhah, fragrance; prthivyam, in the
earth. The earth is dependent on Me who am its fragrance. The natural
sweetness of smell in the earth is cited by way of suggesting sweetness
of taste of water etc. as well. But foulness of smell etc. is due to
contact with particular things, resulting from nescience, unholiness,
etc. of worldly people. Ca, and ; asmi, I am; the tejah, brilliance;
vibhavasau, in fire; so also (I am) the jivanam, life-that by which all
creatures live; sarva-bhutesu, in all beings. And I am the tapah,
austerity; tapasvisu, of ascetics. Ascetics are established in Me who am
that austerity.
