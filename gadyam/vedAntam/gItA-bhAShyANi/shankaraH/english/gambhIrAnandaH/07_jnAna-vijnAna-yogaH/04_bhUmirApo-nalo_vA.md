7.4 Iyam, this; prakrtih, Prakrti, \[Prakrti here does not mean the
Pradhana of the Sankhyas.\] the divine power called Maya; me, of Mine,
as described; bhinna, is divided; astadha, eight-forl; iti, thus:
bhumih, earth-not the gross earth but the subtle element called earth,
this being understood from the statement, 'Prakrti (of Mine) is divided
eight-fold'. Similarly, the subtle elements alone are referred to even
by the words water etc. Apah, water; analah, fire; vayuh, air; kham,
space; manah, mind. By 'mind' is meant its source, egoism. By buddhih,
intellect, is meant the principle called mahat \[Mahat means
Hiranyagarbha, or Cosmic Intelligence.\] which is the source of egoism.
By ahankarah, egoism, is meant the Unmanifest, associated \[Associated,
i.e. of the nature of.\] with (Cosmic) ignorance. As food mixed with
position is called poison, similarly the Unmainfest, which is the
primordial Cause, is called egoism since it is imbued with the
impressions resulting from egoism; and egoism is the impelling force (of
all). It is indeed seen in the world that egoism is the impelling cause
behind all endeavour.
