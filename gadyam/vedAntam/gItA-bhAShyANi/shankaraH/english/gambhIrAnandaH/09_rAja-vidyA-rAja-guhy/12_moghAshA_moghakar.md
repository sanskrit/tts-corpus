9.12 Moghasah, of vain hopes. So also, mogha-karmanah, of vain actions:
their rites, such as Agnihotra etc. which are undertaken by them, verily
become vain, fruitless actions, because of dishonouring the Lord,
disregarding Him who is their own Self. In this way they are of vain
actions. Similarly, mogha-jnanah, of vain knowledge: of fruitless
knowledge; even their knowledge verily becomes useless. And vicetasah,
senseless: i.e., they lose their power of discrimination. Besides,
\[Besides, in the next birth৷৷.\] they become sritah, possessed of; the
mohinim, self-deceptive, self-delusive; prakritim, disposition;
raksasim, of fiends; and asurim, of demons-according to which the body
is the Self; i.e., they become habitually inclined to act cruelly,
saying, 'cut, break, drink, eat, steal others' wealth,' etc. \[The habit
to cut, break, drink, eat, etc. is characteristic of fiends. The habit
of stealing others' wealth, etc. is characteristic of demons.\] This is
stated in the Sruti, 'Those worlds of devils (are covered by blinding
darkness)' (Is. 3).
