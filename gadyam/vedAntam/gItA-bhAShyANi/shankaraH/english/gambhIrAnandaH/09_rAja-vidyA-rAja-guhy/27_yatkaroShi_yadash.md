9.27 O son of Kunti, yat-karosi, whatever you do, what comes
spontaneously; \[Actions such as walking etc. that are spontaneous,not
injunctions of the scriptures.\] yad-asnasi, whatever you eat; and
yat-juhosi, whatever you offer as a sacrifice, whatever sacrifices you
perform-be it prescribed by the Vedas or by the Smrtis; yatadadasi,
whatever you give-gold, food, clarified butter, etc. to Brahmanas and
others; and yat-tapasyasi, whatever austerties you undertake; (all) tat,
that; kurusva madarpanam, you offer to Me. 'Hear what happens to you
when you act thus.'
