9.6 Upadharaya, understand; iti, thus; that yatha, just as; in the
world, the mahan, voluminous-in dimension; vayuh, wind; sarvatragah,
moving everywhere; is nityam, ever; \[During creation, continuance and
dissolution\] akasa-sthitah, present in space; tatha, similarly;
(sarvani, all; bhutani, beings; matsthani,) abide in Me who am
omnipresent like space-abide certainly without any contact.
