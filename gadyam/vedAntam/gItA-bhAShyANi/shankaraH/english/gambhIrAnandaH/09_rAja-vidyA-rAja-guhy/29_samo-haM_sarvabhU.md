9.29 Aham, I; am samah, impartial, eal; sarva-bhutesu, towards all
beings; me, to Me; na asti, there is none; dvesyah, detestable; na,
none; priyah, dear. I am like fire: As fire does not ward off cold from
those who are afar, but removes it from those who apporach, near,
similarly I favour the devotees, not others. Tu, but; ye, those who
approach near, similarly I favour the devotees, not others. Tu, but; ye,
those who; bhajanti, worship Me, God; bhaktya, with devotion; te they;
exist mayi, in Me-by their very nature; \['Their mind becomes fit for My
manifestation, as it has been purified by following the virtuous
path.'\] they do not exist in Me because of My love, Ca, and; aham, I;
api, too; naturally exist tesu, in them, not in others. Thus there is no
hatred towards them (the latter). 'Listen to the greatness of devotion
to Me:'
