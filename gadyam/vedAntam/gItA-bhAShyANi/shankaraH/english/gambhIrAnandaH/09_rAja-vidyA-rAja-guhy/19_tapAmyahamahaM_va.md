9.19 O Arjuna, aham, I, in the form of the sun; tapami, give heat
through some intense rays. Through some rays utsrjami, I pour down;
varsam, rain. Having poured down, again nigrhnami, I withdraw it through
some rays-for eight months. Again I pour it down in the rainy season. I
am eva ca, verily; the amrtam, nectar of the gods; and mrtyuh, death of
the mortals. I Myself am sat, existence-the effect which has come into
bneing in relation to its cause; and its opposite, asat, nonexistence.
\[Nonexistence: the cause which has not become manifest as the effect
possessing name and form, It cannot be admitted that the effect has
absolute existence, for the Upanisad says, 'All transformation has
speech as it basis, and it is name only' (Ch.6. 1. 4). Nor can it be
said that the cause has absolute non-existence, for there is the
text,'৷৷.by what logic can the existent come verily out of nonexistence;
But surely,৷৷.all this was Existence, one without a second' (op. cit.
6.2.2).\] It is not that the Lord is Himself absolutely nonexistence;
nor are effect and cause (absolutely) existence and nonexistent
(respectively). Those men of Knowledge who meditate of Me while
worshpping Me according to the respective forms of sacrifices mentioned
above-regardomg Me as one or multifirious, etc.-, they attain Me alone
according to their conceptions.
