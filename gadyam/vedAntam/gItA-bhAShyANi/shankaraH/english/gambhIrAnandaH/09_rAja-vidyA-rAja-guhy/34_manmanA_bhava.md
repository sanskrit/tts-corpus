9.34 Manmana bhava, have your mind fixed on Me; \[Here Ast. adds the
word vasudeva.-Tr\] and also be madbhakah, devoted to Me. Madyaji,
sacrifice to Me, be engaged in sacrificing to Me. And namaskuru, bow
down; only mam, to Me. Yuktva, by concentrating your mind; and
mat-parayanah, by accepting Me as the supreme Goal; esyasi eva, you
shall surely attain; mam, Me who am God. You shall attain Me evam
atmanam, who am thus the Self: I indeed am the Self of all the beings,
and am also the supreme Goal. You shall attain Me who am such. In this
way, the word atmanam (Self) is to be connected with the preceding word
mam (Me). This is the purport.
