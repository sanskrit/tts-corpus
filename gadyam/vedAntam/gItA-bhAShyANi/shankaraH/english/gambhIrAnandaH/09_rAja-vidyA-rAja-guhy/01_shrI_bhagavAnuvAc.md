9.1 Te, to you; anasuyave, who are not given to cavilling, who are free
from carping; pravaksyami, I shall speak of; idam, this. The Lord
uttered the word 'this' by bearing in mind as an immediately present
fact the knowledge of Brahman that will be and was spoken of in the
earlier chapters. The word tu (however) is used for pointing out a
distinction \[The distinction of Knowledge from meditation that was
being discussed.\]. (I shall speak) of this itself-what is that;-(it is)
guhyatamam, the highest secret; and is jnanam, Knowledge, complete
Knowledge-nothing else-, the direct means to Liberation, as stated in
the Upanisads and the Smrtis, 'Vasudeva is all' (7.19), 'the Self verily
is all this' (Ch. 7.25.2), 'One only, without a second' (op. cit.
6.2.1), etc., and also as stated in such Upanisadic texts as, 'On the
other hand, those who understand otherwise than this come under a
different ruler, and belong to the worlds that are subject to decay'
(op. cit. 7.25.2). (Knowledge) of what kind; It is vijnana-sahitam,
combined with experience; jnatva, by realizing, by attaining; yat, which
Knowledge; moksyase, you shall be free; asubhat, from evil, from worldly
bondage.
