2.13 As to that, to show how the Self is eternal, the Lord cites an
illustration by saying,'৷৷.of the embodied,' etc. Yatha, as are, the
manner in which; kaumaram, boyhood; yauvanam, youth, middle age; and
jara, decrepitude, advance of age; dehinah, to an embodied being, to one
who possesses a body (deha), to the Self possessing a body; asmin, in
this, present; dehe, body . These three states are mutually distinct. On
these, when the first state gets destroyed the Self does not get
destroyed; when the second state comes into being It is not born. What
then; It is seen that the Self, which verily remains unchanged, acires
the second and third states. Tatha, similar, indeed; is Its, the
unchanging Self's dehantarapraptih, acisition of another body, a body
different from the present one. This is the meaning. Tatra, this being
so; dhirah, an intelligent person; na, does not; muhyati, get deluded.
