2.28 It is not reasonable to grieve even for beings which are
constituted by bodies and organs, since 'all beings remain unmanifest'
etc. (Bharata, O descendant of Bharata;) bhutani, all beings,
avyaktaduni, remain unmainfest in the beginning. Those beings, viz sons,
friends, and others, constituted by bodies and organs, \[Another reading
is karya-karana-sanghata, aggregates formed by material elements acting
as causes and effects.-Tr.\] who before their origination have
unmanifestedness (avyakta), invisibility, nonperception, as their
beginning (adi) are avyaktaadini. Ca, and; after origination, before
death, they become vyakta-madhyani, manifest in the middle. Again, they
eva, certainly; become avyakta-nidhanani, unmanifest after death. Those
which have unmanifestness (avyakta), invisibility, as their death
(nidhana) are avyakta-nidhanani. The idea is that even after death they
verily attain unmanifestedness. Accordingly has it been said: 'They
emerged from invisibility, and have gone back to invisibility. They are
not yours, nor are you theirs. What is this fruitless lamentation!'
(Mbh. St. 2.13). Ka, what; paridevana, lamentation, or what prattle, can
there be; tatra, with regard to them, i.e. with regard to beings which
are objects of delusion, which are invisible, (become) visible, (and
then) get destroyed!
