2.41 Kuru-nandana, O scion of the Kuru dynasty; iha, is this path to
Liberation; there is only eka, a single; vyavasayatmika, one-pointed;
buddhih, conviction, which has been spoken of in the Yoga of Knowledge
and which has the characteristics going to be spoken of in (Karma-)
yoga. It is resolute by nature and annuls the numerous branches of the
other opposite thoughts, since it originates from the right source of
knowledge. \[The right source of knowledge, viz the Vedic texts, which
are above criticism.\] Those again, which are the other buddhayah,
thoughts; they are bahu-sakhah, possessed of numerous branches, i.e.
possessed of numerous variations. Owing to the influence of their many
branches the worldly state becomes endless, limitless, unceasing,
ever-growing and extensive. \[Endless, because it does not cease till
the rixe of full enlightenment; limitless, because the worldly state,
which is an effect, springs from an unreal source.\] But even the
worldly state ceases with the cessation of the infinite branches of
thoughts, under the influence of discriminating wisdom arising from the
valid source of knowledge. (And those thoughts are) hi, indeed; anantah,
innumerable under every branch. Whose thoughts; Avyavasayinam, of the
irresolute ones, i.e. of those who are devoid of discriminating wisdom
arising from the right source of knowledg.
