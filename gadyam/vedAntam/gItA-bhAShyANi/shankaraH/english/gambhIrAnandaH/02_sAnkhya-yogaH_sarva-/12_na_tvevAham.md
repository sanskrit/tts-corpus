2.12 Why are they not to be grieved for; Because they are eternal. How;
Na tu eva, but certainly it is not (a fact); that jatu, at any time;
aham, I ; na asam, did not exist; on the contrary, I did exist. The idea
is that when the bodies were born or died in the past, I existed
eternally. \[Here Ast. adds ghatadisu viyadiva, like Space in pot
etc.-Tr.\] Similarly, na tvam, nor is it that you did not exist; but you
surely existed. Ca, and so also; na ime, nor is it that these ;
jana-adhipah, rulers of men, did not exist. On the other hand, they did
exist. And similarly, na eva, it is surely not that; vayam, we; sarve,
all; na bhavisyamah, shall cease to exist; atah param, after this, even
after the destruction of this body. On the contrary, we shall exist. The
meaning is that even in all the three times (past, present and future)
we are eternal in our nature as the Self. The plural number (in we) is
used following the diversity of the bodies, but not in the sense of the
multiplicity of the Self.
