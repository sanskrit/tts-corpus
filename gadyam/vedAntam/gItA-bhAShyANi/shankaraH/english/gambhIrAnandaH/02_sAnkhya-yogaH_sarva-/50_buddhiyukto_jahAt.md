2.50 Listen to the result that one possessed of the wisdom of eanimity
attains by performing one's own duties: Buddhi-yuktah, possessed of
wisdom, possessed of the wisdom of eanimity; since one jahati, rejects;
iha, here, in this world; ubhe, both; sukrta-duskrte, virtue and vice
(righteousness and unrighteousness), through the purification of the
mind and acisition of Knowledge; tasmat, therefore; yujyasva, devote
yourself; yogaya, to (Karma-) yoga, the wisdom of eanimity. For Yoga is
kausalam, skilfulness; karmasu, in action. Skilfulness means the
attitude of the skilful, the wisdom of eanimity with regard to one's
success and failure while engaged in actions (karma) called one's own
duties (sva-dharma) with the mind dedicated to God. That indeed is
skilfulness which, through eanimity, makes actions that by their very
nature bind give up their nature! Therefore, be you devoted to the
wisdom of eanimity.
