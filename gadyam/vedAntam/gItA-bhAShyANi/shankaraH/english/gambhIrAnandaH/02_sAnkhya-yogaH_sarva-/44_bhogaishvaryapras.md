2.44 And vyavasayatmika, one-pointed; buddhih, conviction, with regard
to Knowledge or Yoga; na vidhiyate, does not become established, i.e.
does not arise; samadhau, in the minds the word samadhi being derived in
the sese of that into which everthing is gathered together for the
enjoyment of a person ; bhoga-aisvarya-prasaktanam, of those who delight
in enjoyment and wealth, of those who have the hankering that only
enjoyment as also wealth is to be sought for, of those who identify
themselves with these; and apahrta-cetasam, of those whose intellects
are carried away, whose discriminating judgement becomes covered; taya,
by that speech which is full of various special rites.
