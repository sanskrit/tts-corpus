2.26 This (verse), 'On the other hand,' etc., is uttered assuming that
the Self is transient. Atha ca, on the other hand, if ( conveys the
sense of assumption ); following ordinary experience, manyase, you
think; enam, this One, the Self under discussion; is nityajatam, born
continually, becomes born with the birth of each of the numerous bodies;
va, or; nityam, constantly; mrtam, dies, along with the death of each of
these (bodies); tatha api, even then, even if the Self be of that
nature; tvam, you; maha-baho, O mighty-armed one; na arhasi, ought not;
socitum, to grieve; evam, thus, since that which is subject to birth
will die, and that which is subject to death will be born; these two are
inevitable.
