2.24 Since this is so, therefore ayam, It; acchedyah, cannot be cut.
Since the other elements which are the causes of destruction of one ano
ther are not capable of destroying this Self, therefore It is nityah,
eternal. Being eternal, It is sarva-gatah, omnipresent. Being
omnipresent, It is sthanuh, stationary, i.e. fixed like a stump. Being
fixed, ayam, this Self; is acalah, unmoving. Therefore It is sanatanah,
changeless, i.e. It is not produced from any cause, as a new thing. It
is not to be argued that 'these verses are repetive since eternality and
changelessness of the Self have been stated in a single verse itself,
"Never is this One born, and never does It die," etc. (20). Whatever has
been said there (in verse 19) about the Self does not go beyond the
meaning of this verse. Something is repeated with those very words, and
something ideologically.' Since the object, viz the Self, is
inscrutable, therefore Lord Vasudeva raises the topic again and again,
and explains that very object in other words so that, somehow, the
unmanifest Self may come within the comprehension of the intellect of
the transmigrating persons and bring about a cessation of their cycles
of births and deaths.
