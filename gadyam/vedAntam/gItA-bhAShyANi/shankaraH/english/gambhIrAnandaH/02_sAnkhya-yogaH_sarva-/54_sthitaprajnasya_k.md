2.54 O Kesava, ka, what; is the bhasa, description, the language (for
the description) how is he described by others ; sthita-prajnasya, of a
man of steady wisdom, of one whose realization, 'I am the supreme
Brahman', remains steady; samadhi-sthasya, of one who is Self-absorbed;
Or kim, how; does the sthitadhih, dhih, man of steady wisdom; himself
probhaseta, speak; How does he asita, sit; How does he vrajeta, move
about; That is to say, of what kind is his sitting or moving; Through
this verse Arjuna asks for a description of the man of steady wisdom.
