2.31 Api, even; aveksya, considering; svadharmam, your own duty, the
duty of a Ksatriya, viz battle considering even that ; na arhasi, you
ought not; vikampitum, to waver, to deviate from the natural duty of the
Ksatriya, i.e. from what is natural to yourself. And hi, since that
battle is not devoid of righteousness, (but) is supremely righteous it
being conducive to virtue and meant for protection of subjects through
conest of the earth ; therefore, na vidyate, there is nothing; anyat,
else; sreyah, better; ksatriyasya, for a ksatriya; than that dharmyat,
righteous; yuddhat, battle.
