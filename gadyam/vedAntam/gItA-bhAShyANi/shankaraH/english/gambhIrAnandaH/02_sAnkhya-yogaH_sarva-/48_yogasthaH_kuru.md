2.48 If action is not to be undertaken by one who is under the impulsion
of the fruits of action, how then are they to be undertaken; This is
being stated: Yogasthah, by becoming established in Yoga; O Dhanajaya,
kuru, undertake; karmani, actions, for the sake of God alone; even
there, tyaktva, casting off; sangam, attachment, in the form, 'God will
be pleased with me.' \['Undertake work for pleasing God, but not for
propitiating Him to become favourable towards yourself.'\] Undertake
actions bhutva, remaining; samah, eipoised; siddhi-asidhyoh, in success
and failure even in the success characterized by the attainment of
Knowledge that arises from the purification of the mind when one
performs actions without hankering for the results, and in the failure
that arises from its opposite. \[Ignorance, arising from the impurity of
the mind.\] What is that Yoga with regard to being established in which
it is said, 'undertake'; This indeed is that: the samatvam, eanimity in
success and failure; ucyate, is called; yogah, Yoga.
