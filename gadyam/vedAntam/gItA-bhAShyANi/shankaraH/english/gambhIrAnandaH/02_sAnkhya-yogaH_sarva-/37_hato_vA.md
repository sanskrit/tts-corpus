2.37 Again, by undertaking the fight with Karna and others, va, either;
hatah, by being killed; prapsyasi, you will attain; svargam, heaven; or
jitva, by winning over Karna and other heroes; bhoksyase, you will
enjoy; mahim, the earth. The purport is that in either case you surely
stand to gain. Since this is so, Kaunteya, O son of Kunti; tasmat,
therefore; uttistha, rise up; krta-niscayah, with determination;
yuddhaya, for fighting, i.e. with the determination, 'I shall either
defeat the enemies or shall die.'
