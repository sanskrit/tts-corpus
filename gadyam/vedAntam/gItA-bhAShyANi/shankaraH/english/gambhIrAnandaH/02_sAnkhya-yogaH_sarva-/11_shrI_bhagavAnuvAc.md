2.11 Bhisma, Drona and others are not to be grieved for, because they
are of noble character and are eternal in their real nature. With regard
to them, asocyan, who are not to be grieved for; tvam, you; anvasocah,
grieve, (thinking) 'They die because of me; without them what shall I do
with dominion and enjoyment;'; ca, and; bhasase, you speak; prajnavadan,
words of wisdom, words used by men of wisdom, of intelligence. The idea
is, 'Like one mad, you show in yourself this foolishness and learning
which are contradictory.' Because, panditah, the learned, the knowers of
the Self panda means wisdon about the Self; those indeed who have this
are panditah, one the authority of the Upanisadic text, '৷৷.the knowers
of Brahman, having known all about scholarship,৷৷.' (Br. 3.5.1)
\['Therefore the knowers of Brahman, having known all about scholorship,
should try to live upon that strength which comes of Knowledge; having
known all about this strength as well as scholorship, he becomes
meditative; having known all about both meditativeness and its opposite,
he becomes a knower of Brahman.'\] ; na anusocanti, do not grieve for;
gatasun, the departed, whose life has become extinct; agatasun ca, and
for those who have not departed, whose life has not left, the living.
The ideas is, 'Your are sorrowing for those who are eternal in the real
sense, and who are not to be grieved for. Hence your are a fool!.'
