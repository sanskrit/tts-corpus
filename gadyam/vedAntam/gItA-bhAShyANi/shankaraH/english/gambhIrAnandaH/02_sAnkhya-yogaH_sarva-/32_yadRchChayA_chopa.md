2.32 Why, again, does that battle become a duty; This is being answered
(as follows) \[A specific rule is more authoritative than a general
rule. Non-violence is a general rule enjoined by the scriptures, but the
duty of fighting is a specific rule for a Ksatriya.\]: Partha, O son of
Partha; are not those Ksatiryas sukhinah, happy \[Happy in this world as
also in the other.\] who labhante, come across; a yuddham, battle;
idrsam, of this kind; upapannam, which presents itself; yadrcchaya,
unsought for; and which is an apavrtam, open; svarga-dvaram, gate to
heaven; \[Rites and duties like sacrifices etc. yield their results
after the lapse of some time. But the Ksatriyas go to heaven immediatley
after dying in battle, because, unlike the minds of others, their minds
remaind fully engaged in their immediate duty.\]
