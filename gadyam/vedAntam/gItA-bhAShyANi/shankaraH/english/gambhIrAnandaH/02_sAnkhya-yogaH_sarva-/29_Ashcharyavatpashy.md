2.29 'This Self under discussion is inscrutable. Why should I blame you
alone regarding a thing that is a source of delusion to all!' How is
this Self inscrutable; \[It may be argued that the Self is the object of
egoism. The answer is: Although the individualized Self is the object of
egoism, the absolute Self is not.\] This is being answered in, 'Someone
visualizes It as a wonder,' etc. Kascit, someone; pasyati, visualizes;
enam, It, the Self; ascaryavat, as a wonder, as though It were a wonder
a wonder is something not seen before, something strange, something seen
all on a sudden; what is comparable to that is ascarya-vat; ca, and;
tatha, similarly; eva, indeed; kascit, someone; anyah, else; vadati,
talks of It as a wonder. And someone else srnoti, hears of It as a
wonder. And someone, indeed, na, does not; veda, realize It; api, even;
srutva, after hearing, seeing and speaking about It. Or, (the meaning
is) he who sees the Self is like a wonder. He who speaks of It and the
who hears of It is indeed rare among many thousands. Therefore, the idea
is that the Self is difficult to understand. Now, in the course of
concluding the topic under discussion, \[viz the needlessness of sorrow
and delusion,from the point of view of the nature of things.\] He says,
'O descendant of Bharata, this embodied Self', etc.
