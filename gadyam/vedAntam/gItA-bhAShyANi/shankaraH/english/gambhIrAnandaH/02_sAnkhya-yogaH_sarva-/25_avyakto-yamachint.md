2.25 Moreover, ucyate, it is said that; ayam, This, the Self; is
avyaktah, unmanifest, since, being beyond the ken of all the organs, It
cannot be objectified. For this very reason, ayam, This; is acintyah,
inconceivable. For anything that comes within the purview of the organs
becomes the object of thought. But this Self is inconceivable becuase It
is not an object of the organs. Hence, indeed, It is avikaryah,
unchangeable. This Self does not change as milk does when mixed with
curd, a curdling medium, etc. And It is chnageless owing to
partlessness, for it is not seen that any non-composite thing is
changeful. Not being subject to transformation, It is said to be
changeless. Tasmat, therefore; vidivata, having known; enam, this one,
the Self; evam, thus, as described; na arhasi, you ought not;
anusocitum, to grieve, thinking, 'I am the slayer of these; these are
killed by me.'
