2.47 Te, your; adhikarah, right; is karmani eva, for action alone, not
for steadfastness in Knowledge. Even there, when you are engaged in
action, you have ma kadacana, never, i.e. under no condition whatever; a
right phalesu, for the results of action may you not have a hankering
for the results of action. Whenever you have a hankering for the fruits
of action, you will become the agent of aciring the results of action.
Ma, do not; thus bhuh, become; karma-phalahetuh, the agent of aciring
the results of action. For when one engages in action by being impelled
by thirst for the results of action, then he does become the cause for
the production of the results of action. Ma, may you not; astu, have;
sangah, an inclination; akarmani, for inaction, thinking, 'If the
results of work be not desired, what is the need of work which involves
pain;'
