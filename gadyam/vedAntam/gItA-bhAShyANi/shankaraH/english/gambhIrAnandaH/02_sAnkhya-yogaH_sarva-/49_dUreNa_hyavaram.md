2.49 Then again, O Dhananjaya, as against action performed with eanimity
of mind for adoring God, karma, action undertaken by one longing for the
results; is, hi, indeed; durena, ite, by far; avaram, inferior, very
remote; buddhi-yogat, from the yoga of wisdom, from actions undertaken
with eanimity of mind, because it (the former) is the cause of birth,
death, etc. Since this is so, therefore, saranam anviccha, take resort
to, seek shelter; buddhau, under wisdom, which relates to Yoga, or to
the Conviction about Reality that arises from its (the former's)
maturity and which is the cause of (achieving) fearlessness. The meaning
is that you should resort to the knowledge of the supreme Goal, because
those who under take inferior actions, phala-hetavah, who thirst for
rewards, who are impelled by results; are krpanah, pitiable, according
to the Sruti, 'He, O Gargi, who departs from this world without knowing
this Immutable, is pitiable' (Br. 3.8.10). \[See note under 2.7.-Tr.\]
