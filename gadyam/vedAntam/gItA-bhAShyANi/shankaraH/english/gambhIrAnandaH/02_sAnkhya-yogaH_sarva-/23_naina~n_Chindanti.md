2.23 Why does It verily remain unchanged; This is being answered in,
'Weapons do not cut It,' etc. Sastrani, weapons; na, do not; chindanti,
cut; enam, It, the embodied one under discussion. It being partless,
weapons like sword etc. do not cut off Its limbs. So also, even pavakah,
fire; na dahati enam, does not burn, does not reduce It to ashes. Ca,
and similarly; apah, water; na enam kledayanti, does not moisten It. For
water has the power of disintegrating a substance that has parts, by the
process of moistening it. That is not possible in the case of the
partless Self. Similarly, air destroys an oil substance by drying up the
oil. Even marutah, air; na sosayati, does not dry; (enam, It,) one's own
Self. \[Ast. reads 'enam tu atmanam, but this Self', in place of enam
svatmanam.-Tr.\]
