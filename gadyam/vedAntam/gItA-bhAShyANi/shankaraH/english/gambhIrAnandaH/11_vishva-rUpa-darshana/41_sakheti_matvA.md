11.41 Like a fool, ajanata, without knowing-. Not knowing what; In
answer he says: idam, this; mahimanam, greatness-the Cosmic form; tava,
of Yours, of God; yat, whatever; uktam, was said; maya, by me (to You);
prasabham, rashly, slightingly; pramadat, through inadvertence, being in
a distracted state of mind; va api, or even; pranayena, out of
intimacy-itimacy is the familiarity arising out of love; whatever I have
said because of that reason; erroneously matva, thinking (You); sakha
iti, to be a friend, of the same age; iti, addressing You as, 'O Krsna,'
'O Yadava,' 'O friend,'-. In the clause, 'tava idam mahimanam, ajanata,
without knowing this greatness of Yours,' idam (this) (in the neutor
gender) is connected with mahimanam (greatness) (in masculine gender) by
a change of gender. If the reading be tava imam, then both the words
would be in the same gender.
