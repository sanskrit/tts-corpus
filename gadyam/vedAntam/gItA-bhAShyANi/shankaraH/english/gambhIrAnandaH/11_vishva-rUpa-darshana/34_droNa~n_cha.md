11.34 By saying, 'who have been killed by Me,' the Lord names Drona and
those very warriors with regard to whom Arjuna had (his) doubts. Now
then, uncertainty with regard to Drona and Bhisma is well-founded. Drona
was the teacher of the science of archery, and was eipped with heavenly
weapons; and particularly, he was his (Arjuna's) own teacher and most
respected. Bhisma was destined to die at will, and possessed heavenly
weapons. He fought a duel with Parasurama and remained unvanished. So
also Jayadratha-whose father was performing an austerity with the idea
that anyone who made his son's head fall on the ground would have even
his own head fall. Since Karna also was eipped with an unerring spear
given by Indra, and was a son of the Sun, born of a maiden (Kunti),
therefore he is referred to by his own name itself. As a mere
instrument, tvam, you; jahi, destory them; who have been hatan, killed;
maya, by Me. Ma, do not; vyathisthah, be afraid of them. Yuddhyasva,
fight. Jetasi, you shall coner; the sapatnan, enemies-Duryodhana and
others; rane, in battle.
