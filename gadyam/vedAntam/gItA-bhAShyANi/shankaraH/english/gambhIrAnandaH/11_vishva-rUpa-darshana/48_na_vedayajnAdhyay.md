11.48 Na veda-yajna-adhyayanaih, not by the study of the Vedas and
sacrifices, (i.e.) not by the methodical study of even the four Vedas
and the study of the sacrifices-since the study of the sacrifices is
achieved by the very study of the Vedas, the separate mention of the
study of sacrifices is for suggesting detailed knowledge of sacrifices;
\[This separate mention of the study of sacrifices is necessary because
the ancients understood the study of Vedas to mean learing them by
rote.\] so also, na danaih, not by gifts-in such forms as distributing
wealth eal to the weight of the giver; na ca kriyabhih, not even by
rituals-by Vedic and other rituals like Agnihotra etc.; nor even ugraih
tapobhih, by severe austerities such a Candrayana \[A religious
observance or expiatory penance regulated by the moon's phases. In it
the daily antity of food, which consists of fifteen mouthfuls at the
full-moon, is curtailed by one mouthful during the dark fornight till it
is reduced to nothing at the new moon; and it is increased in a like
manner during the bright fortnight.-V.S.A.\] etc. which are frightful;
sakyah aham, can I; evam rupam, in this form-possessing the Cosmic form
as was shown; drastum, be perceived; nrloke, in the human world;
tvad-anyena, by anyone other than you; kuru-pravira, O most valiant
among the Kurus.
