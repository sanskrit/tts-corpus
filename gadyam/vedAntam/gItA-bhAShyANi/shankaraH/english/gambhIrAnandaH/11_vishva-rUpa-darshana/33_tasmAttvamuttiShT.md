11.33 Tasmat, therefore; tvam, you; uttistha, rise up; (and) labhasva,
gain; the yasah, fame, that Arjuna has conered the Atirathas
\[Atiratha-see note under 1.4.6.-Tr.\], Bhisma, Drona and others, who
are unconerable even by the gods. Such fame can be acired only by
virtuous actions. Jitva, by defeating; satrun, the enemies, Duryodhana
and others; bhunksva, enjoy; a rajyam, kingdom; that is samrddham,
propersous, free from enemies and obstacles. Ete, these; nihatah, have
been definitely killed, made lifeless; eva maya, verily by Me; eva
purvam, even earlier. Bhava, be you; nimitta-matram, merely an
instrument, O Savyasachin. Arjuna was called so because he could shoot
arrows even with his left hand.
