11.35 Srutva, hearing; etat, this, aforesaid; vacanam, utterance;
kesavasya, of Kesava; Kiriti, krtanjalih, with joined palms; and
vepamanah, trembling; nama-skrtva, prostrating himself; aha, said;
bhuyah eva, again; krsnam, to Krsna; sa-gadgadam, with a faltering
voice-. A person's throat becomes choked with phlegm and his eyes full
of tears when, on being struck with fear, he is overcome by sorrow, and
when, on being overwhelmed with affection, he is filled with joy. The
indistinctness and feleness of sound in speech that follows as a result
is what is called faltering (gadgada). A speech that is accompanied with
(saha) this is sa-gadgadam. It is used adverbially to the act of
utterance. Pranamya, bowing down with humility; bhita-bhitah, overcome
by fits of fear, with his mind struck again and again with fear-this is
to be connected with the remote word aha (said). At this juncture the
words of Sanjaya have a purpose in view. How; It is thus: Thinking that
the helpless Duryodhana will be as good as dead when the four
unconerable ones, viz Drona and others, are killed, Dhrtarastra, losing
hope of victory, would conclude a treaty. From that will follow peace on
either side. Under the influence of fate, Dhrtarastra did not even
listen to that!
