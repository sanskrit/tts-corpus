11.55 Pandava, O son of Pandu; yah, he who; mat-karma-krt, works for Me:
work for Me is mat-karma; one who does it is mat-karma-krt-.
Mat-paramah, who accepts Me as the supreme Goal: A servant does work for
his master, but does not accept the master as his own supreme Goal to be
attained after death; his one, however, who does work for Me, accepts Me
alone as the supreme Goal. Thus he is matparamah-one to whom I am the
supreme Goal-. So also he who is madbhaktah, devoted to me: He adores Me
alone in all ways, with his whole being and full enthusiasm. Thus he is
madbhaktah-. Sanga-varjitah, who is devoid of attachment for wealth,
sons, friends, wife and relatives, Sanga means fondness, love; devoid of
them-. Nirvairah, who is free from enmity; sarva-bhutesu, towards all
beings-berefit of the idea of enmity even towards those engaged in doing
unmost harm to him-. Sah, he who is such a devotee of Mine; eti,
attains; mam, Me. I alone am his supreme Goal; he does not attain any
other goal. This is the advice for you, given by Me as desired by you.
