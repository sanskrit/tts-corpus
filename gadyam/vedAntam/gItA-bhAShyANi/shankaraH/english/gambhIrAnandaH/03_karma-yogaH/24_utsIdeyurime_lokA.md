3.24 Cet, if; aham, I; na kuryam, do not perform; karma, action; all
ime, these; lokah, worlds; utsideyuh, will be ruined, owing to the
obsence of work responsible for the maintenance of the worlds. Ca, and,
futher; syam, I shall become; karta, the agent; sankarasya, of
intermingling (of castes). Conseently, upahanyam, I shall be destroying;
imah, these; prajah, beings. That is to say, I who am engaged in helping
the creatures, shall be destroying them. This would be unbefitting of
Me, who am God. 'On the other, if, like Me, you or some one else
possesses the conviction of having attained Perfection and is a knower
of the Self, it is a duty of such a one, too, to help others even if
there be no obligation on his own part.'
