3.35 Svadharmah, one's own duty; being practised even though vigunah,
defective, deficient; is sreyan, superior to, more commendable than;
para-dharmat, another's duty; though svanusthitat, well-performed,
meritoriously performed. Even nidhanam, death; is sreyah, better; while
engaged svadharme, in one's own duty, as compared with remaining alive
while engaged in somody else's duty. Why; Paradharmah, another's duty;
is bhayavahah, fraught with fear, since it invites dangers such as hell
etc.
