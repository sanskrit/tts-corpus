3.14 It is a matter of direct perception that annat, from food, which is
eaten and is transformed into blood and semen; bhavanti, are born;
bhutani, the creatures. Anna-sambhavah, the origin of food; is
parjanyat, from rainfall. Parjanyah, rainfall; bhavati, originates; from
yajnat, from sacrifice. This accords with the Smrti, 'The oblations
properly poured into fire reaches the sun. From the sun comes rain, from
rain comes food, and from the sun comes rain, from rain comes food, and
from that the creatures' (Ma.Sm.3.76). (Here) sacrifice means its unie
\[Also termed as the unseen result (adrsta).-Tr.\] result. And that
sacrifice, i.e. the unie result, which arises (samudbhavah) from action
(karma) undertaken by the priest and the sacrificer, is
karma-samudbhavah; it has action for its origin.
