3.17 Tu, but; that manavah, man, the sannyasin, the man of Knowledge,
steadfast in the knowledge of the Self; yah, who; atmaratih eva syat,
rejoices only in the Self-not in the sense objects; and atma-trptah, who
is satisfied only with the Self-not with food and drink; and is
santustah, contented; eva, only; atmani, in the Self; tasya, for him; na
vidyate, there is no; karyam, duty \[Duty with a view to securing
Liberation.\] to perform. \[Rati, trpti and santosa, though synonymous,
are used to indicate various types of pleasures. Or, rati means
attachment to objects; trpti means happiness arising from contact with
some particular object; and santosa means happiness in general, arising
from the acisition of some coveted object only.\] All people surely feel
contened by aciring an external thing. But this one, without depending
on it, remains contented only with the Self; thta is to say, he remains
detached from everything. The idea it that, for a man who is such a
knower of the Self, there is no duty to undertake.
