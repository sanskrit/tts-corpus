3.18 Moreover, tasya, for him, who rejoices in the supreme Self; na,
there is no; artham, concern; eva, at all; krtena, with performing
action. Objection: In that case, let there be some evil called sin owing
to non-performance! Reply: Iha, here, in this world; na, nor is there;
for him kascana, any (concern); akrtena, with nonperfromance. Certainly
there is no evil in the form of incurring sin or in the form of
self-destruction. Ca, moreover; asya, for him; na asti, there is no;
kascit artha-vyapasrayah sarva-bhutesu, dependence on any object, from
Brahma to an unmoving thing, to serve any purpose. Vyapasrayah is the
same as vyapasrayanam, dependence, which is possible of being created by
action promted by necessity. (For him) there is no end to gain by
depending on any praticular object, due to which there can be some
action for that purpose. 'You (Arjuna) are not established in this
fullest realization which is comparable to a flood all around.'
