3.23 Again, O Partha, yadi, if; jatu, at any time; aham, I; an, do not;
varteyam, continue; atandritah, vigilantly, untiringly; karmani, in
action; manusyah, men: anuvartante, willl follow; mama, My; vartma,
path; sarvasah, in every way, I being the Highest. And if that be so,
what is the harm; In reply the Lord says: \[Ast. omits this sentence
completely.-Tr.\]
