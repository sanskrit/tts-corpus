3.31 Ye, those; manavah, men; who (nityam, ever;) anutisthanti, follow
accordingly; me matam, My teaching- this teaching of Mine, viz that
'duty must be performed', which has been stated with valid reasoning;
sraddhavantah, with faith; and anasuyantah, without cavil, without
detracing Me, Vasudeva, the Teacher \[Here Ast. adds 'parama,
supreme'-Tr.\]; te api, they also, who are such; mucyante, become freed;
karmabhih, from actions called the righteous and the unrighteous.
