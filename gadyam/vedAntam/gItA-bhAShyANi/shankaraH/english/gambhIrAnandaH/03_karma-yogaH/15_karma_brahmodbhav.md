3.15 Again, \[a different reading in place of this is: 'Tat ca vividham
karma kuto jatamityaha, From where did those various kinds of action
originate; In reply the Lord says৷৷.' Still another reading is: 'Tat ca
karma brahmodbhavam iti aha, And the Lord says: That action has the
Vedas as its origin.'-vide A.A., 1936, p. 116). Astekar's reading is:
Tat ca evam vidham karma kuto jatamityaha, And from where has this kind
of aciton originated; The answers this.'-Tr.\] viddhi, know; that karma,
action; is brahmodbhavam, it has Brahma, the Veda, as its udbhavam,
origin. \[Here Ast. adds 'revealer'-Tr.\] Further, Brahma, called the
Veda, is aksara-samudbhavam, it has aksara, the Immutable, Brahman, the
supreme Self, as its source. This is the meaning. Since the Veda came
out, like the breath of a man, from the supreme Self Itself, called the
Immutable, therefore the Veda, being the revealer of everything, is
sarva-gatam, all pervading. Even though all-pervading, the Veda is
nityam, for ever; pratisthitam, based; yajne, on sacrifice, because the
injunctions about sacrifices predominate in it.
