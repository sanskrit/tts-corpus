being done; sarvasah, in ever way; gunaih, by the gunas, (i.e.) by the
modifications in the form of body and organs; (born) prakrteh, of
Nature-Nature, (otherwise known as) Pradhana \[Pradhana, Maya, the Power
of God.\], being the state of eilibrium of the three alities of sattva,
rajas and tamas; ahankara-vimudha-atma, one who is deluded by egoism;
manyate, thinks; iti, thus; 'Aham karta, I am the doer.' Ahankara is
self-identification with the aggregate of body and organs. He whose
atma, mind, is vimudham, diluded in diverse ways, by that (ahankara) is
ahankara-vimudha-atma. He who imagines the characteristics of the body
and organs to be his own, who has self-identification with the body and
the organs, and who, through ignorance, believes the activities to be
his own-, he thinks, 'I am the doer of those diverse activities.'
