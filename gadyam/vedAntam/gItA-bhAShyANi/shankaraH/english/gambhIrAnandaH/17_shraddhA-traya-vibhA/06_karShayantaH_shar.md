17.6 (And who,) acetasah, being non-discriminating; karsayantah,
torture; bhuta-gramam, all the organs; sarirastham, in the body, ca, as
also; torture eva, even; mam, Me; antah-sarira-stham, who reside in the
body as the witness of its actions and intellect-non-adherence to My
injunctions itself is 'torturing Me'; viddhi, know; tan, them;
asura-niscayan, as possessed of demoniacal convictions. Know them so
that they may be avoided. This is an instruction. The liking of persons
possessing the alities of sattva, rajas and tamas for foods that are
divided into three groups, viz succulent, oleaginous, etc., is
respectively being shown here so that, by knowing the presence of the
alities of sattva, rajas and tamas (in oneself) from the indications of
the degree of one's preference for particular foods as are succulent,
oleaginous, etc., one may avoid foods having the characteristics of
rajas and tamas, and accept food with the characteristics of sattva.
Similarly, sacrifices etc. also are being explained here under three
categories according to the distinguishing ality of sattva etc. So that
one may reject those known to be born of rajas and tamas, and undertake
only those born of sattva.
