17.28 O son of Prtha, whatever is hutam, offered in sacrifice, poured as
oblation; and dattam, given in charity to Brahmanas,without faith;
whatever tapah, austerity; is taptam, performed without faith; so also,
whatever is krtam, done without faith, e.g. praise, salutation, etc.;
all that ucyate, is said to be; asat iti, of no avail, since it is
outside th course of discipline leading to Me. Ca, and, although
involving great effort; na ca tat, it is of no conseence; pretya, after
death, for producing (some) result; na, nor even for any result; iha,
because it is condemned by the wise. \[Thus it is established in this
chapter that, among persons who are not at all versed in the scriptures,
but are possessed of (either of the) three characterisitcs of sattva,
(rajas) etc., only those shall attain to Liberation who steadfastly
resort to sattva alone by partaking of sattvika food, (performing
sattvika) sacrifices) etc. to te exclusion of rajasika and tamasika food
etc., who destroy any defect that might arise in sacrifice etc. by
uttering the names of Brahman, who have fully purified their intellect,
and who have attained to the realization of Truth arising from one's
being endowed with such disciplines as hearing and and thinking
(sravana, manana) of, and meditation (nididhyasana) on Brahman.\]
