10.42 Athava, or, on the other hand; kim, what is the need; of tava
jnatena, your knowing; etena bahuna, this extensively-but
imcompletely-in the above manner, O Arjuna; You listen to this subject
that is going to be stated in its fullness: Aham, I; sthitah, remain;
vistabhya, sustaining, supporting, holding firmly, in a special way;
idam, this; krtsnam, whole; jagat, creation; ekamsena, by a part, by a
foot \[The Universe is called a foot of His by virtue of His having the
limiting adjunct of being its efficient and material cause.\] (of
Myself), i.e. as the Self of all things \[As the material and the
efficient cause of all things\]. The Vedic text, 'All beings form a foot
of His' (Rg., Pu. Su. 10.90.3; Tai. Ar. 3.12.3) support this. \[A Form
constituted by the whole of creation has been presented in this chapter
for meditation. Thery the unalified transcendental Reality, implied by
the word tat (in tattva-masi) and referred to by the latter portion of
the Commentator's otation (viz tripadasyamrtam divi: The immortal
three-footed One is established in His own effulgence), becomes
established.\]
