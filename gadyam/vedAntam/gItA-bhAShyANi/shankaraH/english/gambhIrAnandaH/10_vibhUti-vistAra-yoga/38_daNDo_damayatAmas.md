10.38 Damayatam, of the punishers; I am dandah, the rod, which is the
means of controlling the lawless. I am the nitih, righteous policy;
jagisatam, of those who desire to coner. And guhyanam, of things secret;
I am verily maunam, silence. I am jnanam, knowledge; jnanavatam, of the
men of knowledge.
