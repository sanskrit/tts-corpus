of going; by virtue of making the janas, the demons who are opposed to
the gods, go to hell etc. He is called Jana-ardana. Or, He is called so
because He is prayed to \[The verbal root ard has got a second meaning,
'to pray'.\] by all beings for the sake of human goals, viz prosperity
and Liberation. Kathaya, narrate to me; bhuyah, again, though spoken of
