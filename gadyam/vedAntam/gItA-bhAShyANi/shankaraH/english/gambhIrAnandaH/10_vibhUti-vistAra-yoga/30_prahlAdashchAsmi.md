10.30 Daityanam, among demons, the descendants of Diti, I am the one
called Prahlada. And I am kalah, Time; kalayatam, among reckoners of
time, of those who calculate. And mrganam, among animals; I am
mrgendrah, the loin, or the tiger. And paksinam, among birds; (I am)
vainateyah, Garuda, the son of Vinata.
