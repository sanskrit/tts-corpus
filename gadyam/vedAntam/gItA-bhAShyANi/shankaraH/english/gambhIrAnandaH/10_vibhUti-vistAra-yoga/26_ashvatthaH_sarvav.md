10.26 Sarva-vrksanam, among all trees, (I am) the Asvatta; and Narada
devarsinam, among the divine sages-those who were gods and became sages
by virtue of visualizing Vedic mantras; among them I am Narada.
Gandharvanam, among the gandharvas, I am the gandharva called
Citraratha. Siddhanam, among the perfected ones, among those who, from
their very birth, were endowed with an abundance of the wealth of
virtue, knowledge and renunciation; (I am) munih, the sage Kapila.
