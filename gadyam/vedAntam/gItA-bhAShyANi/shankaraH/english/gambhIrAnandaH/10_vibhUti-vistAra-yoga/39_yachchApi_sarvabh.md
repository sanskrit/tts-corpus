10.39 Ca, moreover; O Arjuna, yat api, whatsoever; is the bijam, seed,
the source of growth ; sarva-bhutanam, of all beings; tat, that I am. As
a conclusion of the topic the Lord states in brief His divine
manifestations: Na tat asti bhutam, there is no thing; cara-acaram,
moving or non-moving; yat, which; syat, can exist; vina maya, without
Me. For whatever is rejected by Me, from whatever I withdraw Myself will
have no substance, and will become a non-entity. Hence the meaning is
that everything has Me as its essence.
