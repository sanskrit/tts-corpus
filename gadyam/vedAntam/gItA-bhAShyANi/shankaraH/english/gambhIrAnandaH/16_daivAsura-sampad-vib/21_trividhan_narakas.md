16.21 Idam, this; dvaram, door; narakasya, of hell-for entering it;
which is the nasanam, destroyer; atmanah, of the soul; is trividham of
three kinds. It is that by the mere entry into which the soul perishes,
i.e., it ceases to be fit for attaining any human goal. hence it is said
that it is the door which is the destroyer of the soul. Which is that;
Kamah, passion; krodhah, anger; and also lobhah, greed. Tasmat,
therefore; tyajet, one shoud forsake; etat trayam, these three. Since
this door is the destroyer of the soul, therefore one should renounce
this group of three-passion etc. This is a eulogy of renunciation.
