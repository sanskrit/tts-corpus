16.16 Aneka-citta-vibhrantah, bewildered by numerous thoughts,
confounded variously by thoughts of the kind stated above;
moha-jala-samavrtah, caught in the net of delusion-moha is
non-discrimination, lack of understanding; that itself is like a net
because of its nature of covering; enshrouded by that; prasaktah,
engrossed; kama-bhogesu, in the enjoyment of desirable objects, being
immersed in that itself; they patanti, fall, owing to the sins
accumulated thery; asucau, into a foul; narake, hell, such as Vaitarani.
\[Vaitarani: It is the most terrible place of punishment; a river filled
with all kinds of filth-blood, hair, bones etc., and running with great
impetuosity, hot and fetid. The other hells are Tamisra, Andhatamisra,
Raurava, Kumbhipaka, and so on.\]
