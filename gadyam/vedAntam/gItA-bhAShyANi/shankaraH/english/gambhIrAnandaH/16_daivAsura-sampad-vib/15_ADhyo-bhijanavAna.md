16.15 Adhyah, I am rich in wealth; abhi-janavan, high-born in respect of
my lineage; my seven generations are endowed with Vedic learnig etc.
From that point of view also there is none eal to me. Kah anyah, who
else; asti, is there; sadrsah, similar; maya, to me; Besides, yaksye, I
shall perform sacrifices; in respect of sacrifices also I shall defeat
others. Dasyami, I shall give-to actors and others; modisye, I shall
rejoice, and I shall derive intense joy. Iti, thus; are they
ajnana-vimohitah, diversely deluded by non-discrimination, subject to
various indiscrimination.
