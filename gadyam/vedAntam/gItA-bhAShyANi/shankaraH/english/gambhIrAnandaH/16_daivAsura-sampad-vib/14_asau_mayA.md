16.14 Asau, that; unconerable satruh, enemy, named Devadatta; hatah, has
been killed; naya, by me; and hanisye, I shall kill; aparan, the other
wretched ones. What will these pitiable persons do; There is none eal to
me at all. Aham, I; am the isvarah, lord; I am the bhogi, enjoyer; and I
am siddhah, well-established in every respect-I am blessed with sons,
and grandsons born of sons and daughters. Not only am I a man, but I am
also balavan, mighty; and I myself am sukhi, happpy; others are born to
be but a burden to the earth!
