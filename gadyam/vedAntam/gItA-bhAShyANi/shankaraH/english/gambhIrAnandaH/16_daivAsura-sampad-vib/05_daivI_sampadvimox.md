16.5 That which is daivi, divine; sampad, nature; is vimoksaya, for
Liberation from the bondage of the world. The asuri, demoniacal nature;
mata, is considered to be; nibandhaya, for inevitable bondage. So also
is the fiendish nature. Now, when such a statement was made, the Lord,
noticing Arjuna having this kind of inner cogitation-'Am I endowed with
the demoniacal nature, or am I endowed with the divine nature;'-, says:
ma, do not; sacah, grieve, O son of Pandu! Asi, you are; abhijatah,
destined to have, born with the good fortune of having; daivim, the
divine; sampadam, nature; i.e., you are destined for an illustrious
future.
