16.8 Te, they, the domoniacal persons; ahuh, say; that the jagat, world;
is asatyam, unreal-as we ourselves are prone to falsehood, so is this
whole world unreal; apratistham, it has no basis, it does not have
righteousness and unrighteousness as its basis; it is anisvaram, without
a God-nor is there a God who rules this (world) according to
rigtheousness and unrighteousness (of beings). Hence they say that the
world is godless. Moreover, it is aparaspara-sambhutam, born of mutual
union. The whole world is born of the union of the male and female
impelled by passion. (That union is) kama-haitukam, brought about by
passion. Kama-haitukam and kama-hetukam are the same. Kim anyat, what
other (cause can there be); There exists to other unseen cause such as
righteousness, unrigtheousness, etc. Certainly, the passion of living
beings is the cause of the world. This is the view of the materialists.
