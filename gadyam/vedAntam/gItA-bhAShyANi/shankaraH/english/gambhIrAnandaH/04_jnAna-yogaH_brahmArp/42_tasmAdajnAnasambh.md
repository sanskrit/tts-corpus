4.42 Tasmat, therefore, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; atistha, take
recourse to, i.e. undertake; yogam, yoga -performance of actions, which
is a means to full Illumination; and now, uttistha, rise up for battle;
chittva, cutting asunder; jnanasina, with the sword of
Knowledge-Knowledge is full Illumination, which is a destroyer of such
defects as sorrows, delusion, etc.; that itself is the sword; with that
sword of Knowledge-;enam, this; samsayam, doubt; atmanah, of your own,
which is a source of one's own ruin and is most sinful; hrtstham, in the
heart, residing in the intellect; ajnana-sambhutam, arising from
ignorance, born of non-discrimination. The word atmanah is used because
doubt concerns oneself. Indeed, another's doubt cannot be removed by
someone else. Hence the word 'own' is used. So, although the doubt is
with regard to the Self, it is really one's own.
