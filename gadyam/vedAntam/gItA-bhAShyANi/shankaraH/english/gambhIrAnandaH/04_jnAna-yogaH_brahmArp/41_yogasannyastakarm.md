4.41 Yoga-sannyasta-karmanam, one who has renounced actions through
yoga: that person who is a knower of the supreme Goal, by whom actions
called righteous or unrighteous have been renounced through the yoga
characterized as the Knowledge of the supreme Goal. How does one become
detached from actions through yoga; The Lord says: He is
jnana-samchinna-samsayah, one whose doubts (samsaya) have been fully
dispelled (samchinna) by Knowledge (jnana) characterized as the
realization of the identity of the individual Self and God. O
Dhananjaya, he who has thus renounced actions through yoga, atmavantam,
who is not inadvertent, not careless; him, karmani, actions, seen as the
activities of the gunas (see 3.28); na nibadhnanti, do not bind, (i.e.)
they do not produce a result in the form of evil etc. Since one whose
doubts have been destroyed by Knowledge-arising from the destruction of
the impurities (of body, mind, etc.) as result of the practise of
Karma-yoga-does not get bound by acitons owing to the mere fact of his
actions having been burnt away by Knowledge; and since one who has
doubts with regard to the practice of the yogas of Knowledge and actions
gets ruined-
