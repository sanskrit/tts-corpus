4.34 Viddhi, know; tat, that, the process by which It is acired; by
approaching teachers pranipatena, through prostration, by lying fully
streched on the ground with face downward, with prolonged salutation;
pariprasnena, through iniry, as to how bondage and Liberation come, and
what are Knowledge and ignorance; and sevaya, through the service of the
guru. (Know it) through these and other (disciplines) \[Other
disciplines such as control of the mind, body, etc. Sankaracarya's own
words in the Commentary are evamadina, after which Ast. puts a full
stop, and agreeing with this, A.G. says that the word viddhi (know) is
to be connected with evamadina. Hence this translation. Alternatively,
those words have to be taken with prasrayena. Then the meaning will be,
'Being pleased with such and other forms of humility৷৷.'-Tr.\]. Being
pleased with humility, jnaninah, the wise ones, the teachers;
tattva-darsinah, who have realized the Truth; upadeksyanti, will impart,
will tell; te, you; jnanam, the Knowledge as described above. Although
people may be wise, some of them are apt to know Truth just as it is,
while others may not be so. Hence the alification, 'who have realized
the Truth'. The considered view of the Lord is that Knowledge imparted
by those who have full enlightenment becomes effective, not any other.
That being so, the next verse also becomes appropriate:
