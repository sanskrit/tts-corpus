4.31 Yajna-sista-amrta-bhujah, those who partake of the nectar left over
after a sacrifice, i.e. those who, after performing the sacrifices
described above, eat, during the leisure after the sacrifice, the food
called nectar, as prescribed by the injunctions; yanti, reach; sanatanam
brahma, the eternal Brahman. For the sake of consistency (with the
Upanisads) it is understood that if they (the sacrificers) are seekers
of liberation, (then they reach Brahman) in due course of time. \[The
Upanisads describe the different stages through which those who do good
deeds and practise meditation have to pass before reaching the alified
Brahman after death. For liberation there is need also of purification
of the heart, Thus, they reach Brahman by stages, and not immediately
after death. (See Ch. 8.5 and subseent portion; also, Br. 4.3.35 to
4.4.25, etc.)\] Even ayam lokah, this world, common to all beings; na
asti, ceases to exist; ayajnasya, for one who does not perform
sacrifices, for him who does not have to his credit even a single one of
the above sacrifices. Kutah anyah, what to speak of the other world
which can be achieved through special disciplines; kurusattama, O best
among the Kurus!
