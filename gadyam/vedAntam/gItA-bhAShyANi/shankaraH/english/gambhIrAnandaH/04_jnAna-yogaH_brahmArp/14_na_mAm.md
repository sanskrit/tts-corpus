4.14 Because of the absence of egoism, those karmani, actions; na
limpanti, do not taint; mam, Me, by becoming the originators of body
etc. And me, for Me; na sprha, there is no hankering for the results of
those actions. But in the case of transmigrating beings, who have
self-identification in the form, 'I am the agent', and thirst for
actions as also for their results, it is reasonable that actions should
taint them. Owing to the absence of these, actions do not taint Me.
Anyone else, too, yah, who; abhijanati, knows; mam, Me; iti, thus, as
his own Self, and (knows), 'I am not an agent; I have no hankering for
the results of actions'; sah, he; na badhyate, does not become bound;
karmabhih, by actions. In his case also actions cease to be the
originators of body etc. This is the import.
