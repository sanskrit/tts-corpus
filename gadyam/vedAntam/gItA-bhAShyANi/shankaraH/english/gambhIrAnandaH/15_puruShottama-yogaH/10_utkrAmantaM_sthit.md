15.10 Thus, the embodied soul, utkarmantam, when it is leaving the
body-the body that was assumed earlier; or sthitam, while residing in
the (present) body; or bhunjanam, experiencing sound etc.; or
guna-anvitam, in association with, i.e. identified with, the alities
called happiness, sorrow and delusion-even when, under such conditions,
this one comes very much within the range of cognition; vimudhah, the
persons who are diversely deluded as a result of their hearts being
forcibly attracted by the enjoyments of seen and unseen objects; na, do
not; anu-pasyanti, see. And the Lord regrets this saying, 'Alas! How
sorrowful this is!' Those others, again, jnana-caksusah, who have the
eye of knowledge, \[Jnana-caksuh means the scriptures supported by
reasoning, which are the means of knowledge.\] who have the insight of
under-standing which has arisen from the valid means of knowledge, i.e.,
those having a clear vision; pasyanti, see this one.
