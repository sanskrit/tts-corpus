15.16 There are imau, these; dvau, two-grouped separately; purusau,
persons, so called \[Persons-so called only figuratively, since they are
the limiting adjuncts of the supreme Person.\]; loke in the world; the
ksarah, mutable-one group consists of the perishable; the other person
is the aksarah, immutable, opposite of the former, the power of God
called Maya, which is the seed of the origin of the person called the
mutable. That which is the receptacle of the impressions of desires,
actions, etc. of countless transmigrating creatures is called the
immutable person. Who are those persons; The Lord Himself gives the
answer: Ksarah, the mutable; consists of sarvani, all; bhutani, things,
i.e. the totality of all mutable things. Kutasthah is the one existing
as Maya: Kuta means a heap; kutasthah, is that which exists like a heap.
Or, kuta is maya, deception, falsehood, crookedness, which are
synonymous; that which exists in the diverse forms of maya etc. is the
kutasthah. It is ucyate, called; the aksarah, immutable, because, owing
to the countless seeds of worldly existence, it does not perish.
