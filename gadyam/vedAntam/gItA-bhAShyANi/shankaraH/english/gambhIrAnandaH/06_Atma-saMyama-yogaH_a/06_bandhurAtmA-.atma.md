6.6 Tasya, of him; yena, by whom; jitah, has been conered, subdued; his
eva atma, very self, the aggregate of body and organs; that atma, self;
is bandhuh, the friend; atmanah, of his self. The idea is that he is a
coneror of his senses. Tu, but; anatmanah, for one who has not conered
his self, who has no self-control; atma eva, his self itself; varteta,
acts; satruvat, like an enemy; satrutve, inimically, with the attitude
of an enemy. As an enemy, who is different from oneself, does harm to
oneself, similarly one's self behaves like an enemy to oneself. This is
the meaning. \[If the body and organs are under control, they are
helpful in concentrating one's mind on the Self; but, if they are not
under control, they oppose this concentration.\]
