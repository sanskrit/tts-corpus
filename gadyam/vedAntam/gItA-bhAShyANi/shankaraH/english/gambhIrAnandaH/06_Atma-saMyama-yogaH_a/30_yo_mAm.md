6.30 Yah, one who; pasyati, sees; mam, Me, Vasudeva, who am the Self of
all; sarvatra, in all things; ca, and; sees sarvam, all things, all
created things, beginning from Brahma; mayi, in Me who am the Self of
all;-aham, I who am God; na pranasyami, do not go out; tasya,of his
vision-of one who has thus realized the unity of the Self; ca sah, and
he also; na pranasyati, is not lost; me, to My vision. That man of
realization does not get lost to Me, to Vasudeva, because of the
indentity between him and Me, for that which is called one's own Self is
surely dear to one, and since it is I alone who am the seer of the unity
of the Self in all.
