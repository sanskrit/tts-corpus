6.26 In the beginning, the yogi who is thus engaged in making the mind
established in the Self, etat vasamnayet, should bring this (mind) under
the subjugation; atmani eva, of the Self Itself; niyamya, by
restraining; etat. it; tatah tatah, from all those causes whatever, viz
sound etc.; yatah yatah, due to which, doe to whatever objects like
sound etc.; the cancalam, restless, very restless; and therefore
asthiram, unsteady; manah, mind; niscarati, wanders away, goes out due
to its inherent defects. (It should be restrained) by ascertaining
through discrimination those causes to be mere appearances, and with an
attitude of detachment. Thus, through the power of practice of Yoga, the
mind of the yogi merges in the Self Itself.
