\[It has been shown thus far that Karma-yoga has monasticism as its
ultimate culmination. And in the course of expounding Dhyana-yoga
together with its ausxiliaries, and instructing about the means to
control the mind, the Lord rules out the possibility of absolute ruin
for a person fallen from Yoga. He has also stated that steadfastness in
Knowledge is for a man who knows the meaning of the word tvam (thou) (in
'Thou are That'). All these instructions amount to declaring that
Liberation comes from the knowledge of the great Upanisadic saying,
'Thou art That.'\]
