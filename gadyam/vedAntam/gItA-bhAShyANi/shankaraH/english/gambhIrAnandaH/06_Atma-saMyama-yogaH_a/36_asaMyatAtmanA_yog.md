difficult to be attained; asamyata-atmana, by one of uncontrolled mind,
by one who has not controlled his mind, the internal organ, by practice
and detachment. Tu, but, on the other hand; sakyah, Yoga is possible;
avaptum, to be attained; yatata, by one who strives, who repeatedly
makes effort; upayatah, through the means described above; and
vasyatmany, by one of controlled mind, by him whose mind has been
brought under control through practice and detachment. As to that, by
accepting the practice of Yoga, actions leading to the attainment of
this or the next world may be renounced by a yogi, and yet he may not
attain the result of perfection in Yoga, i.e. full Illumination, which
is the means to Liberation. Conseently, at the time of death his mind
may waver from the path of Yoga. Apprehending that he may be thery
ruined.
