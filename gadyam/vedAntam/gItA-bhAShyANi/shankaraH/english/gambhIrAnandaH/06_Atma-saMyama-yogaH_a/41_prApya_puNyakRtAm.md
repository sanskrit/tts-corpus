6.41 Prapya, attaining, reaching, lokan, the worlds; punya-krtam, of the
righteous, of the performers of the Horse-sacrifice, etc.; and usitva,
residing there, enjoying the stay; for sasvatih, eternal; samah, years;
(then,) when the period of enjoyment is over, the yoga-bhrastah, man
fallen from Yoga, the one who had set out on the path Yoga, i.e. a
monk-as understood from the force of the context \[From Arjuna's estion
it minght appear that he was asking about the fate of people who fall
from both the paths, viz that of Karma and of Meditation. But the
possibility of getting ruined by performing actios (rites and duties)
according to Vedic instructions does not arise, since their results are
inevitable. However, the estion of ruin is relevant in the case of a
monk, for on the one hand he has renounced actions, and on the other he
may fail to attain perfection in Yoga in the present life. Hence, the
Lord's answer relates to the fall and ruin of a monk alone.\];
abhijayate, is born; gehe, in the house; sucinam, of the pious, who
perform actions according to scriptural instructions; and srimatam, who
are prosperous.
