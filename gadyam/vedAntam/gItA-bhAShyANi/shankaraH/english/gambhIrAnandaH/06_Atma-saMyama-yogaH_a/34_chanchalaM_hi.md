6.34 Hi, for, O Krsna-the word krsna is derived from the root krs
\[Another derivative meaning may be-'the capacity to draw towards
Himself all glorious things of this and the other world'.\], in the
sense of 'uprooting'; He is Krsna because He uproots the defects such as
sin etc. of devotees-; manah, the mind; is cancalam, unsteady. Not only
is it very unsteady, it is also pramathi, turbulent. It torments,
agitates, the body and the organs. It brings them under extraneous
control. Besides, it is balavat, strong, not amenable ot anybody's
restraint. Again, it is drdham, obstinate, hard as the (large shark
called) Tantu-naga (also known as Varjuna-pasa). Aham, I; manye,
consider; tasya, its-of the mind which is of this kind; nigrahah,
control, restraint; to be (suduskaram, greatly difficult;) vayoh iva, as
of the wind. Control of the wind is difficult. I consider the control of
the mind to be even more difficult than that. This is the idea. 'This is
just as you say.'
