18.71 Yah narah, any man who; being sraddhavan, reverential; and
anasuyah, free from cavilling; srnuyat api, might even hear this
text-the word even suggests that one who knows the meaning (of the
Scripture) hardly needs to be mentioned-; sah api, he too; becoming
muktah, free from sin; prapnuyat, shall attain; subhan, the blessed,
auspicious; lokan, worlds; punya-karmanam, of those who perform virtuous
deeds, of those who perform rites like Agnihotra etc. In order to
ascertaini whether or not the disciple has comprehended the meaning of
the Scripture, the Lord asks (the following estion), the intention of
the estioner beings, 'If it is known that it has not been comprehended,
I shall again make him grasp it through other means.' Hery is shown the
duty of the teacher that a student should be made to achieve his goal by
taking the help of a different method.
