18.76 And, rajan, O king, Dhrtarastra; after having heard, samsmrtya
samsmrtya, while repeatedly remembering; imam, this; adbhuttam, unie;
samvadam, dialogue; kesava-arjunayoh, between Kesava and Arjuna; which
is punyam, sacred, removes sin even when heard; hrsyami, I rejoice;
muhuh, muhuh, every moment.
