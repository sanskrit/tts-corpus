18.62 Gaccha saranam, take refuge; tam eva, in Him, the Lord alone;
sarva-bhavena, with your whole being, for getting rid of your mundane
sufferings, O scion of the Bharata dynasty. Tat-prasadat, through His
grace, through God's grace; prapsyasi, you will attain; param, the
supreme; santim, Peace, the highest Tranillity; and the sasvatam,
eternal; sthanam, Abode, the supreme State of Mine who am Visnu.
