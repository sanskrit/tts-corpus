18.5 Yajna-dana-tapah-karma, the practice of sacrifice, charity and
austerity-this threefold practice; na tyajyam, is not to be abandoned;
tat, it; is eva, surely; karyam, to be undertaken. Why; Yajnah,
sacrifice; danam, charity; and tapah, austerity; are eva, verily;
pavanani, the purifiers, the causes of sanctification; manisinam, of the
wise, i.e. of those who do not seek results for themselves.
