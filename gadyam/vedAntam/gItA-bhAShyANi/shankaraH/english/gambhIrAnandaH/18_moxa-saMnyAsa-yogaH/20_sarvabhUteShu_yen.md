18.20 Viddhi, know; tat, that; jnanam, knowledge, realization of the
Self as non-dual, complete realization; to be sattvikam, originating
from sattva; yena, through which knowledge; iksate, one sees; ekam, a
single; avyayam, undecaying-that which does not undergo mutation either
in itself or by the mutation of its alities-' i.e. eternal and
immutable; bhavam, Entity-the word bhava is used to imply an entity-,
i.e. the single Reality which is the Self; sarvabhutesu, in all things,
in all things begining from the Unmanifest to the unmoving things; and
through which knowledge one sees that Entity to be avibhaktam,
undivided; in every body, vibhaktesu, in all the deversified things, in
the different bodies. The idea is: that Reality which is the Self
remains, like Space, undivided. Being based on rajas and tamas, those
that are the dualistic philosophies are incomplete, and hence are not by
themselves adeate for the eradication of worldly existence.
