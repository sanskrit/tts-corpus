18.37 Yat, that joy which is; iva, like; visam, poison, a source of
pain; agre, in the beginning-when it first comes in the early stages of
(acisition) of knowledge, detachment, meditation and absorption, since
they involve great struggle; but amrtopamam, comparable to nectar;
pariname, in the end, when it arises from the maturity of knowledge,
detachment, etc.; and which atma-buddhi-prasadajam, arises from the
purity (prasada), trasparence like water, of one's intellect
(atma-buddhi); tat, that; sukham, joy; is proktam, spoken of, by the
learned ones ;as sattvikam, born of sattva. Or, the phrase
atma-buddhi-prasadajam may mean 'arising from the high degree of
clearness of that atma-buddhi (knowledge of or connected with the
Self)'; therefore it is born of sattva.
