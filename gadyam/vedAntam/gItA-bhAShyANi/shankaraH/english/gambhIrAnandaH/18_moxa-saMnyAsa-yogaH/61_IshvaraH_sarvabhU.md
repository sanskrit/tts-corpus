18.61 Arjuna, O Arjuna-one whose self is naturally white (pure), i.e.
one possessing a pure internal organ. This follows from the Vedic text,
'The day is dark and the day is arjuna (white) (Rg. 6.9.1). Isvarah, the
Lord , Narayana the Ruler; tisthati, resides, remains seated; hrd-dese,
in the region of the heart; sarva-bhutanam, of all creatures, of all
living beings. How does He reside; In answer the Lord says: bhramayan,
revolving; mayaya, through Maya, through delusion; sarva-bhutani, all
the creatures; as though yantra-arudhani, mounted on a machine-like man'
etc., made of wood, mounted on a machine. The word iva (as though) has
to be thus understood here. Bhramayan, revolving, is to be connected
with tisthati, resides (conveying the idea, 'resides৷৷.while
revolving').
