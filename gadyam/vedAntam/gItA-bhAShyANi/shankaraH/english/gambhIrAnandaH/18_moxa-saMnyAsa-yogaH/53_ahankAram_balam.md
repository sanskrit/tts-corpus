18.53 (That person) vimucya, having discarded; ahan-karam, egotism,
thinking of the body, organs, etc. as the ego; balam, force-which is
associated with desire and attachment; not the other kind of strength
consisting in the fitness of the body etc., becuase being natural it
cannot be descarded-; darpam, pride, which follows elation and leads to
transgresson of righteousness-for the Smrti says, 'An elated person
becomes proud; a proud man transgresses righteousness' (Ap. Dh. Su.
1.13.4); kamam, desire; krodham, anger, aversion; parigraham,
superfluous possessions-even after removing the defects in the organs
and the mind, there arises the possibility of acceptance of gifts either
for the maintenance of the body or for righteous duties; discarding them
as well, i.e. becoming a mendicant of the param-hamsa class; nirmamah,
free from the idea of possession, becoming devoid of the idea of 'me'
and 'mine' even with regard to so much as one's body and life; and for
the very same reason, santah, serene, withdrawn; the monk who is
effortless and steadfast in Knowledge, kalpate, becomes fit;
brahma-bhuyaya, for becoming Brahman.
