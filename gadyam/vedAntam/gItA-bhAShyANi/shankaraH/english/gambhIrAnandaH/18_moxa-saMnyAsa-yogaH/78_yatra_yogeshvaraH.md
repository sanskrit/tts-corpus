18.78 To be brief, yatra, where, the side on which; there is Krsna,
yogeswarah, the Lord of yogas-who is the Lord of all the yogas and the
source of all the yogas, since they originate from Him; and yatra,
where, the side on which; there is Partha, dhanurdharah, the wielder of
the bow, of the bow called Gandiva; tatra, there, on that side of the
Pandavas; are srih, fortune; vijayah, victory; and there itself is
bhutih, prosperity, great abundance of fortune; and dhruva, unfailing;
nitih, prudence. Such is me, my ; matih, conviction.
