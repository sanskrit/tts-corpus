18.75 And vyasa-prasadat, through the favour of Vyasa, by having
received divine vision from him; aham, I; srutvan, heard; etat \[The
Commentator uses etam in the masculine gender, in place of etat in the
text, because it refers to the masculine word samvada.\] (should rather
be etam), this; guhyam, secret dialogue, such as it is; concerning the
param, supreme; Yogam, Yoga-or, this dialogue itself is the Yoga because
it is meant for it-; krsnat, from Krsna; yogeswarat, from the Lord of
yogas; kathayatah, while He was speaking; svayam, Himself; saksat,
actually; not indirectly through others.
