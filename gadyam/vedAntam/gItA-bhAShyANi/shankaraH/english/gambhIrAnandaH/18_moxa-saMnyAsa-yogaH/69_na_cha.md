among the present human beings, surely none else other than him exists
who is a better accomplisher of what I cherish. Moreover, na bhavita,
nor will there be in future; anyah, anyone else, a second person; bhuvi,

means for It, therefore he will have no inclination to transmit
scriptural teachings. To this the Lord's answer is: One longing for
Liberation has a duty to impart this scriptural teaching to one
possessing the aforesaid alities.\]
