18.24 But tat, that; karma, action; udahrtam, is said to be; rajasam,
born of rajas; yat, which; is kriyate, done; kamepsuna by one desirous
of results; va, or; saahankarena, by one who is egotistic; and
bahulaayasam, which is highly strenuous, accomplished by the agent with
great effort. 'Egotistic' is not used in contrast to knowledge of Truth.
What then; It is used in contrast to the absence of egotism in an
ordinary person versed in the Vedic path. For in the case of the knower
of the Self, who is not egotistic in the real sense, there is no estion
of his being desirous of results or of being an agent of actions reiring
great effort. Even of actions born of sattva, the agent is one who has
not realized the Self and is possessed of egoism; what to speak of
actions born of rajas and tamas! In common parlance, a person versed in
the Vedic path, even though not possessing knowledge of the Self, is
spoken of as being free from egotism thus-'This Brahmana is free from
egotism'. Therefore, 'sahan-karena va' is said in contrast to him only.
Punah (again) is used to complete the meter.
