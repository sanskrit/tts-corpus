18.58 Maccittah, having your mind fixed on Me; tarisyasi, you will cross
over; sarva-durgani, alldifficulties, all cuases of transmigration which
are difficult to overcome; mat-prasadat, through My grace. Atha cet, if,
on the other hand; tvam, you; na srosyasi, will not listen to, will not
accept, My words; ahankarat, out of egotism, thinking 'I am learned';
then vinanksyasi, you will get destroyed, will court ruin. And this
should not be thought of by you-'I am independent. Why should I follow
another's bidding;'
