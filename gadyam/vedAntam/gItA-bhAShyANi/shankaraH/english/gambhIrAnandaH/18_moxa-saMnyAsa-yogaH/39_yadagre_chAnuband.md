18.39 That joy is udahrtam, said to be; tamasam, born of tamas; yat,
which; both agre, in the beginning; ca, and; anubandhe, in the seel,
after the end (of enjoyment); is mohanam, delusive; atmanah, to oneself;
and nidra-alasya-pramada-uttham, arises from sleep, laziness and
inadvertence. Therefore, now is begun a verse in order to conclude this
section \[The section showing that all things in the whole of creation
are under the influence of the three gunas.\].
