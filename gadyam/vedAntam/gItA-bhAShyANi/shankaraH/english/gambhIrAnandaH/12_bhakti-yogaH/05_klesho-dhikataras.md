12.5 Tesam, for them; avyakta-asakta-cetasam, who have their minds
attached to the Unmanifest; klesah,the struggle; is adhika-tarah,
greater. Although the trouble is certainly great for those who are
engaged in works etc. for Me, still owing to the need of giving up
self-identification with the body, it is greater in the case of those
who accept the Immutable as the Self and who kept in view the supreme
Reality. Hi, for; avyakta gatih, the Goal which is the Unmanifest-(the
goal) which stands in the form of the Immutable; that is avapyate,
attained; duhkham, with difficulty; dehavadbhih, by the embodied ones,
by those who identify themselves with the body. Hence the struggle is
greater. We shall speak later of the conduct of those who meditate on
the Unmanifest.
