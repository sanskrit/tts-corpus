12.2 Ye, those who, being devotees; upasate, meditate; mam, on Me, the
supreme Lord of all the masters of yoga, the Omniscient One whose vision
is free from purblindness caused by such defects as attachment etc.;
avesya,by fixing, concentrating; their manah, minds; mayi, on Me, on God
in His Cosmic form; nitya-yuktah, with steadfast devotion, by being
ever-dedicated in accordance with the idea expressed in the last verse
of the preceding chapter; and being upetah, endowed; paraya, with
supreme; sraddhaya faith;-te, they; matah, are considered; to be
yukta-tamah, most perfect yogis; me, according to Me, for they spend
days and nights with their minds constantly fixed on Me. Therefore, it
is proper to say with regard to them that they are the best yogis. 'Is
it that the others do not become the best yogis;' No, but listen to what
has to be said as regards them:'
