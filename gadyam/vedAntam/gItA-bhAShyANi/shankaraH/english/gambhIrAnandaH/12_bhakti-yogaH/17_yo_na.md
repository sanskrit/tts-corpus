object; na dvesti, does not fret on getting an undesirable object; na
socati, does not lament on the loss of a dear one; and na kanksati, does
not hanker after an object not acired; subha-asubha-parityogi, who gives
up good and bad, who is apt to give up good and bad actions; bhaktiman,
who is full of devotion-he is dear to Me.
