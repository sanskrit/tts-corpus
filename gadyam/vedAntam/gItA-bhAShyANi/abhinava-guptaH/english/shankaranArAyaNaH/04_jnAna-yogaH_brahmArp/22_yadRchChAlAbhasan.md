nibadhyate 'gets bound' is a usage of transitive verb with its object
functioning as the subject. \[Hence\] the meaning is : The Self binds
Itself by undertaking the dirt of mental impressions for fruits \[of
action\]. Otherwise \[the usage would amount to attribute\] freedom of
actions to the insentient in binding \[the Self\] - a proposition which
is not a very happy one.
