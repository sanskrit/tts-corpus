4.11-12 Ye yatha etc. and Kanksantah etc. Different persons with
differents forms in their mind take refuge in Me. Assuming the same
\[respective\] forms for them I favour the. Only in this manner, those
who are full of Me and those who are not so-all just follow my Path. For
\[even the performance of sacrifices\] Jyotistoma and so on, is not a
different path; that is also My own will of that nature. Indeed it is
going to be declared \[by the Lord\] as 'the four-fold caste-structure
has been created by Me'. Some one says : The Present Tense
(anuvarttante) is in the sense of Potential. Just as in the sentence
'They take hold of the group of sixteen in the Atiratra \[sacrifce\]',
the expression 'They take hold of' means 'They should take hold of' in
the same way in the present sentence too 'they follow', means 'they
should follow'. The success \[of the action\] viz., the enjoyment and
emancipation is \[achieved\] here alone in this word of men and not
anywhere else.
