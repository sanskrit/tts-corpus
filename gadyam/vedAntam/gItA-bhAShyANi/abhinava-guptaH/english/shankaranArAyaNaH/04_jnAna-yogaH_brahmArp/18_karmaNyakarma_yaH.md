4.18 Karmani etc : He who finds the actions, \[seemingly\] of his own,
to be non-actions \[of his\], on account of his being non-performer \[of
any action\], because of his state of total tranility; and he who
recognises the non-actions \[of his\] i.e., the actions performed by
others, as actions being performed by himself (or who recognises the
non-actions undertaken by others as being undertaken by himself),
because of his intrinsic nature of the fully risen state; that person
alone is a man of intelligence in the midst of all; and he \[alone\]
performs action fully i.e., in its entirity. Therefore what fruit should
be borne for him by what action ; This is at the stage of rising. But,
at the stage of total tranility he injures, or cuts all actions. Thus he
performs all action or performs no action. This is the secret and sacred
knowledge, got by sitting near (by serving) the feet of the preceptors.
Therefore -
