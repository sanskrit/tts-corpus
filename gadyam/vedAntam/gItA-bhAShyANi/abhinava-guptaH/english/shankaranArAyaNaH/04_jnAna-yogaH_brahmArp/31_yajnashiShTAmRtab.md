Nirananda, which is of the nature of relaxing in their own Self and
which has been ordained-i.e., brought about - by the sacrifice and which
is the remnant of the sacrifice in the form of satisfying \[the deities
of\] their own sense-organs. Yet, remaining as Brahman Itself, they get
themselves mixed \[in this mundane life\] to their heart-content. Here
we refrain \[ourselves\] from the free talk of clearly disclosing what
is highly secret. Further, here a good amount of tasty secret has been
kept well hidden. Yet, this becomes an object of \[actual\] chewing and
\[thus\] becomes the cause for enjoying (realising) what is Real, in the
case of those persons whose \[bodily and internal\] elements have been
ealised by the powerful medicines of the tradition learnt from the
revered teachers, pleased with service, laden with very assiduous
devotion. In this context other explanations have been offered by
\[other\] commentators. However, let the intellectuals weigh and decide
for themselves, those explanations and the etymological interpretations
offered by our revered preceptors. So, look ! What is the use of the
sport of criticising the statements of those commentators ; Hence let us
stick to only what we have begun with.
