4.26 Srotradini etc. But others \[offer\] the sense-organs into the
fires of the restrainer. Restrainer : the mind. Its fires are the
tongues of flame that are in the form of subdued views of objects and
are capable of burning up desires. Into them they offer the
sense-organs. Hence, they are the performers of penance-sacrifices.
Still others offer objects into the fires of sense-organs that are fully
set-blaze by wisdom and that are capable of burning up the fruits \[of
actions\]. I.e., they seek enjoyment only for destroying the \[past\]
mental impression of differences \[between the enjoyer and the objects
of enjoyment\]. This is the secret and sacred truth. Hence I (Ag.) have
myself stated in the laghvi Prakriya (the Little Process) as : 'The
object of enjoyment does not manifest as different from you, the
enjoyer. Because, it is the \[process of\] enjoyment that itself is the
identification (or unity) of hte enjoyer and the object of enjoyment'.
In the \[work\] Spanda also \[it has been said\] : 'It is the enjoyer
himself who remains in all the instances and at all times, in the form
of the object of enjoyment'.
