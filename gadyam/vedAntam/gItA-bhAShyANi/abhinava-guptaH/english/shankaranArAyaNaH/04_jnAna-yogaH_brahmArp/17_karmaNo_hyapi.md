action and non-action is difficult to comprehend. That is to say there
is bad action even among the action that has been ordained \[in the
scriptures\], just as the animal-slaughter in the \[pious\] Agnistoma

scripture\], there is auspicious action; for example there is an end for
the trouble of the people in the act of killing a murderous animal. Even
in the case of non-performance of action, there do exist \[both\] the
auspicious and inauspicious acts; for there will be necessarily \[some\]
acts performed by the sense of speech and by the mind as they are
difficult to avoid without wisdom. Therefore on account of its
mysterious nature, even hte experts have not properly understood the
action as : 'Prosperity would be for as by this \[particular\]
auspicious action; and emancipation would be for us by that
\[particular\] non-undertaking of \[certain\] actions'. Therefore, it is
the fire of wisdom taught in the seel, that alone is capable of
positively burning down the fuel of all the auspicious and inauspicious
