4.1-3 Evam etc. upto uttamam. Eventhough it has come down by regular
succession of teacher, it is lost now. By this \[statement\] the
Bhagavat indicates the rarity (or difficulty) and respectability of this
knowledge. You are My devotee and friend too : You are a devotee having
nothing but Me as your final goal and you are a friend too. This 'too'
indicates the secondary importance \[of the friendship\]. Hence, just as
in the sentence 'wander begging food \[etc\]', the importance lies in
the act of begging food, but unimportance in the act of bringing the
cow; in the same way, in the present case it is devotion towards the
teacher that is important and not the friendship also. This is the idea
intended here.
