4.5-9 Bahuni etc. upto Arjuna. Indeed the Bhagavat is Himself devoid of
all bodily connections on account of His having the group of the 'six
attributes' in toto. Yet, out of His nature of stabilising \[the
universe\], and out of compassion, He sends forth (or creates) that is
which the Self is secondary. The meaning is this : He takes hold of a
body, in which the Self, with the group of 'six alities' in full,
remains secondary because of Its role as a helper of the body. On
account of this, His birth is divine. For, it has been created not by
the results of actions, but by His own Trick-of-Illusion, by the highest
knowledge of Yoga, and by the energy of Freedom of His own. His action
too is divine, as it is incabable of yielding fruits \[for Him\].
Whosoever knows this truth in this manner i.e., realises in his own Self
also in this manner, he necessarily understands the Bhagavat Vasudeva
beng.
