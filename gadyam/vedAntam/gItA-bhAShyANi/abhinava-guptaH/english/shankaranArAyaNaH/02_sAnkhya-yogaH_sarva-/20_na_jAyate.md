2.20 Na jayate etc. Having not been at one time, This etc. : this Self
will come to be, having not been at any time non-existent, but only
having been existent. Therefore This is not born, This does not die too.
For, having been \[at one time\], This will never be non-existent \[at
another time\]; but certainly This will be \[always\] existent.
