2.42-44 Yam imam etc., upto na vidhiyate. Those, who crave for objects
of desire, speak, on their own accord, of this flowery Vedic speech
which is pervaded by the fruits i.e., the heaven in the future; and who,
hence, desire the action itself as the fruit of their birth - these are
men without insight. further, having their mind carried away by the same
Vedic sentence imagined by themselves, these persons, eventhough they
are endowed with the determinate knowledge, are not fit for
concentration, because they do not decide this (concentration) as a
fruit \[of their action\]. This is the purport of the traid of these
verses.
