2.23-25 Nainam etc. upto arhasi. The weapons etc., that cause
destruction, haldly do anything to This. For, being, by nature,
exclusively pure Consciousness, remaining without support, having no
component parts and being independent, this cannot be destroyed through
the process of either assumption of an altogether different nature, or
the destruction of the support, or the mutual separation of the
component parts, or the rise of an opponent, and so on. Nor the act to
going to another body is a new thing for This. For, even when This is
\[apparently\] with a single body, This travels always to different
body; for the body does not remain the same even for a moment. By
understanding this Self to be as such, you should not lament This.
