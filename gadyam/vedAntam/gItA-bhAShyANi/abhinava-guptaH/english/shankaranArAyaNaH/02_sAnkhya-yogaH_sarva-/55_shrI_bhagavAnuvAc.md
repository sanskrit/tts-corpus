2.55 Prajahati etc. \[The expression 'a man-of-stabilized-intellect'
denotes\] a man whose intellect has stabilized, i.e., has grown roots.
Growing roots is growing roots permanently on the Self. For, if that is
achieved, the agitation in the form of desire born of the distraction by
sense-objects comes to an end. Therefore, the nomenclature 'a
man-of-stabilized-intellect' applied to a man-of-Yoga, has an
etymological sense and it is appropriate in this way. In this manner one
estion has been answered.
