2.70 Apuryamanam etc. the man of Yoga does not run out for the sake of
pleasure; but, rather just as the floods of the rivers enter into the
sea, the objects of pleasure \[themselves\] continuously enter into him
on account of their being peculiar attributes of the sense-organs; and
they do not create in him waves \[of agitation\]. thus the third estion
is decided.
