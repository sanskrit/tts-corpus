2.63 Dhyayatah etc. krodhat etc. In the case of an ascetic, the very act
of abandoning sense-objects itself resutls in undertaking the
sense-objects. For, they abandon indeed by meditating \[on them\], and
at the very time of such a meditation, attachment etc., are born in
regular succession. Hence the act of abandoning objects is harmless only
in the case of a man-of-stabilized-intellect. (65)
