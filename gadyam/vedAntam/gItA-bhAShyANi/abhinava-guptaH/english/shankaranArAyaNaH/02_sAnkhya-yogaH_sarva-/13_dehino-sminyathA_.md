2.12-13 Na hi etc. Dehinah etc Never indeed did I not exist, but I did
exist \[always\]. Likewise are you and these kings. If there can be
lamentability for one, on attaining change in physical form then why is
one not lamented over when one attains the youth from the boyhood ; He,
who is wise, does not lament. But, wisdom is easily attainable for him
whose concern is not even for this \[present\] body. Therefore you must
seek wisdom.
