2.4-6 Katham etc. upto Dhartarastrah. By the portion Bhisma and Drona in
war' etc., and by the portion 'I would \[not\] enjoy the objects of
pleasure', the Sage indicates that in Arjuna's objection, the intention
for a particular act and the intention for a particular result are the
points deserving rejection. By the portion 'We do not know this' etc.,
he speaks of the intention for a particular action. For, without
intention no action is possible. Certainly one does not proceed on a war
with an intention of getting defeated. '\[In the present war\] even our
victory would be surely our misfortune.' This he says by the portion 'It
is good even to go about begging without killing the elders'. It is also
impossible to conclude 'Whether we desire victory or defeat'; for even
in the case of our victory our relatives would perish totally.'
