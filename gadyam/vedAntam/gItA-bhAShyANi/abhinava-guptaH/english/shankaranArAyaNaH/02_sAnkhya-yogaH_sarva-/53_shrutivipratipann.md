2.52-53 Yada te etc. Sruti-etc. At the time, when the determining facult
with regard to the Yoga is attained, the clear sign of recognizing it,
is this : An attitude of futility about the revealed literature that has
to be listened to, that has been listened to and that is being declared.
What has been declared by the above is this : 'This present view of
yours about the ruination of your race is out of place and it is due to
the influence of your deceptive notion, born of mental impressions
created by your listening to the teachings of those scriptures that
favour the observers who are fallen deep into the course of ignorance.
But, that view shall vanish when the respect for such a teaching
disappears.
