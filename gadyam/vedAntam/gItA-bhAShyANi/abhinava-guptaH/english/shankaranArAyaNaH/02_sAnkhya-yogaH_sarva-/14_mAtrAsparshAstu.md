2.14 Matra etc. But the unwise lament even over those passing situations
of cold and heat, pleasure and pain that are created by those touches
i.e., the contacts of the sense-objects-referable with the term matra -
with the Soul through the door of the sense-organs; but the wise do not
do so. Thus says \[the Lord\]. Or, the passage may be interpreted as :
The touches (contacts) of these objects are with the matras, i.e., with
the sense-organs, and not directly with the Supreme Self, Coming :
birth. Going : destruction, Those situations that have these two you
must forbear i.e., put up with.
