11.37 Kasmat etc. Existent (11.Sat) : i.e. as a purport of words (11.or
as material object). Non-existent (11.Asat) : Because, the Absolute does
not become an object of perception. Or Asat signifies negation; \[in
fact\] it is also well connected with the words which denote it
directly, or indicate it indirectly by denoting what contains it; it
also enjoys a form (11.becomes an object) of knowledge (11.of its own);
and \[hence\] is has no separate existence other than the existence of
the Absolute Brahman ; (11.It is) beyond both the existent and
non-existent : For, It is realised when the knowledge of both of them
disappears. (11.38)
