11.18 Tvam aksaram etc. Guardian of the pious acts of the Satvatas.
Satvatas are the same as the Satvatas i.e. those who are established in
the Truth that does not take cognizance of any difference between the
Action (11.Spanda) and the Consciousness; the Truth which is nothing but
Existentiality and is in the form of Awarenes. Their pious act is that
act \[of meditation\] of theirs which - on account of its being
continously engaged in the process of undertaking and rejecting
\[things\] - consists of the act of emanation and absorption, and is the
most superior of all the paths \[leading to salvation\]. The Lord
protects that pious act. This is the secret in this chapter and it has
been made almost clear by me (11.Ag.) in my (11.Ag.'s) Vivrti
(11.Commentary) on the Devistotra (11.Goddess-Hymn). That is
self-evident to the learned readers, with critical accuman, and
initiation. Hence, why to take recourse to the verbiage of explaining
again and again what is already known very clearly.
