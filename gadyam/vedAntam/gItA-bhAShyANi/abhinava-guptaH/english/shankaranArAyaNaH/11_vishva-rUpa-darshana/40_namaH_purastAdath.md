11.39-40 Namo namah etc. Salutation and salutation : This repetition
reveals the intensity of the devotion. What has been taught by the past
chapters by the Bhagavat regarding His own intrinsic nature, Arjuna -
witnessing the same by perception - declares it openly by way of
devotional hymn. Hence, to comment on the hymn would symply amount to
the repetition \[of what has already been said by us\]. Hence, let me
(11.Ag.) abstain \[from commenting on it\].
