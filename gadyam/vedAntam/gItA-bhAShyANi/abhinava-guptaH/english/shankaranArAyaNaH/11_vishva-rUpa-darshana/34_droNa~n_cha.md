11.33-34 Tasmat etc. Drona etc. The world is of the nature of perfect
and imperfect knowledge and it is swallowed (11.completely controlled)
by the power of the perfect, imperfect and mixed Consciousness. Hence,
here an answer is given accordingly by the Bhagavat. This secret is a
almost indicated in this chapter. Yet for the benefit of those persons
who are capable of understanding only what has been clearly marked, let
us (11.Ag.) assume the misfortune of taking the trouble of writing a few
lines. What is declared by the Bhagavat - viz., 'As the foes have been
slain \[by Me\], be a token cause and win glory', this is by way of
answering to what Arjuna has said earlier viz., 'We do not know who,
amongst both of us, is more powerful than the other etc. (11.II, 6)'.
