15.19 Yo mam etc. He, who knows Me thus i.e., he who meditates
exclusively on Me as identical with all, and to be the very Brahman - he
realises all to be identical with Me and adores (or experiences) Me
alone with his entire being viz., his form, action and thought. \[That
is to say\], whatever he perceives, he experiences it as the form of the
Bhagavat ; and so on. Hence \[it has been said\] by myself (Ag.) in the
Sivasaktyavinabhavastotra as : O Mother (Goddess) ! Our praise to You is
unusual one ; all (uttering) sounds constitute Your body indeed; in my
entire body and in all \[my\] mental and external activities there is
Your association. O Siva, O Alleviator of what is inauspicious ! When I
fully contemplate in this manner, then it has been accomplished in the
world, without any effort \[of mine\], that for me there is indeed not
even a small fraction of time without praise, recitation \[of hymns\],
worship and contemplation \[of Yours\].
