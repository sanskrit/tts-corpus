15.7 Mama etc. The individual Soul is a portion just of the Brahman only
: Because, due to the attribute (or, nature) viz., the nescience, the
Self does not realise Its all pervaisveness and because the
Consciousness is also not absent, It is figuratively referred to as
portion \[of the Brahman\]. For, a real apportioning is not possible
\[in the Absolute\]. For the scripture also says : 'In the case of the
Brahman (the Absolute), even the particular manifestation (or a
particular space) does not preclude Its all-comprehensive nature'. This
figurative usage may be resorted to wherever reired. Hence there is no
room for any difference of opinion.
