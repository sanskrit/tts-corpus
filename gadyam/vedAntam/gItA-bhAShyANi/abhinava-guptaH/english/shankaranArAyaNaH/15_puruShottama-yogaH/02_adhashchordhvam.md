15.1-2 Urdhva-mulam etc. Adhas ca etc. In other scriptural texts it is
delcared 'All is the holy Fig-tree; that alone is to be meditated upon'.
The present verse tells us this : What is intended by that declaration
is only the religious meditation of the Brahman, the Bhagavat. Root :
the one with a highly tranil nature. That is high (above) : Becasue it
can be attained by him alone who has withdrawn himself from every other
\[lower\] thing. The \[Vedic\] hymns are the leaves \[of it\] etc. :
Just as the girth, height, the fruits and the taste etc. of a tree are
indicated by its leaves, in the same fashion the idea of the
Brahman-being is through the scriptures that are included in the 'Vedic
hymns'. This is what is narrated here. With Strands : i.e., with the
Sattva etc. Well developed : i.e., starting from gods down to the
stationary ones. Of this tree, the roots, that are below, are the good
and bad actions.
