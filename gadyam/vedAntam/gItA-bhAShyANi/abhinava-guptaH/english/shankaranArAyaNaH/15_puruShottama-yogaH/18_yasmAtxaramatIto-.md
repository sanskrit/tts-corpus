15.16-18 Dvav imau etc. upto Purusottamah. What has been stated in the
passage 'There are two persons in the world etc.', is this : The body
organism is made of the earth and other elements. In the world every
person, unitelligent by nature, takes the body for the Self and
\[hence\] views the Soul to be of perishing nature. Hence, the sense of
duality does not come to an end with regard to the worldly persons,
because of their delusion. But I am (the I-consciousness is) the One
favouring all, and by cutting the daulity-knot I am to be realised as
the One pervading all. (I) have transcended the perishing : Since the
elements are insentient. (I) have transcended the nonperishing : Since
the omnipresence \[of the Self\] is cut off (not comprehended) when the
Self is not properly realised. In the world and in the Veda too I am
acclaimed as the Highest of Persons : The Self same Supreme Self,
admitting no duality, is described in this manner with the sentences 'He
is he Highest Person' and the like.
