16.17-20 Atmasambhavitah etc. upto gatim. They pretend to perform
sacrifices : The meaning is that their sacrifice is fruitless. Indeed
all is ruined because of their anger. Or, namayjna \[may mean\] 'the
sacrifices which are in name only'. Or, it \[may denote\] those
sacrifices that are performed for one's name sake i.e., for one's
reputation, because of which one gets the appellation as 'He is
performer of \[such and such\] sacrifices' These sacrifices, performed
out of hypocricy alone, do not , however fetch any fruit. Becasue these
persons are rugged with anger etc., they hate people and by that they
hate Me only \[in fact\]. For, I, the Vasudeva (the Universal Soul),
dwell every-where. Entertaining hatred towards their own Soul, they
perform action, that is hostile to themselves, and responsible for their
own fall into the hells. These persons I hurl into nothing but the
demoniac wombs.
