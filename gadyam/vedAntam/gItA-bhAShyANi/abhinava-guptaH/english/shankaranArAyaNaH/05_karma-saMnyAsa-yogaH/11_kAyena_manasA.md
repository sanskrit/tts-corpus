5.7-11 Yogayuktah etc. upto atma-siddhaye. He, whose (by whom) Self is
\[realised to be\] the Self of all beings, is not stained, eventhough he
performs all \[sorts of\] actions. For, he has undertaken neither what
is enjoined nor what is prohibited. Hence, even while performing actions
such as seeing and the like, he bears in mind, -i.e., he resolves with
\[all\] firmness of observation, - that 'If the sense-organs like eyes
etc., function on their respective objects, what does it matter for me ;
Indeed one is not stained by what another does'. This act is nothing but
dedicating one's actions to the Brahman. In this regard the
characteristic mark is his detachment. Due to that he is not stained.
Because they do not have attachment, the men of Yoga perform actions
only with their body etc., that are freed from attachment and do not
depend on each other.
