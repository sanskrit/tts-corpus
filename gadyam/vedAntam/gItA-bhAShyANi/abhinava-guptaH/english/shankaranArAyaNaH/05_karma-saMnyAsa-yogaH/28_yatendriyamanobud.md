5.27-28 Sparsan etc.; Yatendriya-etc. Warding off outside, i.e., not
accepting, the external contacts (objects); establishing all the
sense-organs - indicated by 'sense of sight' - in the middle place in
between the two wandering ones, i.e., the right and the left views in
the form of desire and wrath viz., in that particular place which is
free from both these; he would remain fixing in eipoise (or making
neutral) both the forward (upward) and backward (downward) moving forces
viz., the pious and impious acts, within the mental modification. Nasa
'that which acts crookedly'. This is mental modification, because it
behaves crookedly i.e., ineally due to anger etc. The same is in the
external plane. A man of Yoga of this type is just free, though he
transacts all mundane business.
