5.24 Yo'ntah etc : Within : For him there is happiness nowhere but
within and it does not depend on any external object ; there alone he
rejoices; his lustre is there only. But, there is an apparent ignorance
\[of him\] in his worldly dealings. That has been said as - '\[A man of
realisation\] would wander, like a fool, with no inclination for
discussion.' (PS, 71)
