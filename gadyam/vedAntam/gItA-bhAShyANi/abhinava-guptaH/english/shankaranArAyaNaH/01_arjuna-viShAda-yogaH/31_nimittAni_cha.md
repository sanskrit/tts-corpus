1.30 1.34 Na ca sreyah, etc., upto mahikrte. Those who are wrongly
conceived as object of slaying, with the individualizing idea that
'these are my teachers etc.'8 would necessarily generate sin. Similarly,
the act of slaying even of those deserving to be slain in the battle-if
undertaken with the idea that 'This battle is to be fought for the
apparent results like pleasures, happiness etc.'- then it generates sin
necessarily. This idea lurks in the objection \[of Arjuna\]. That is why
a reply is going to be given \[by Bhagavat\] as 'You must undertake
actions simply as your own duty, and not with an individualizing idea'.
