1.1 Dharmaksetre etc. Here some \[authors\] offer a different
explanation as1 :-Kuruksetra : the man's body is the ksetra i.e., the
facilitator, of the kurus, i.e., the sense-organs. 2 The same is the
field of all wordly duties, since it is the cuse of their birth; which
is also the field of the righteous act that has been described as :
'This is the highest righteous act viz., to realise the Self by means of
the Yogas'; and which is the protector4 \[of the embodied Self\] by
achieving emancipation \[by means of this\], through the destruction of
all duties. It is the location where there is the confrontation among
all ksatras, the murderous ones-because the root ksad means 'to kill' -
viz, passion and asceticism, wrath and forbearance, and others that
stand in the mutual relationship of the slayer and the slain. Those that
exist in it are the mamakas,-i.e., the intentions that are worthy of man
of ignorance and are the products of ignorance-and those that are born
of Pandu: i.e., the intentions, of which the soul is the very knowledge
itself5 and which are worthy of persons of pure knowledge. What did they
do; In other words, which were vanished by what; Mamaka : a man of
ignorance as he utters \[always\] 'mine'6. Pandu : the pure one.7
