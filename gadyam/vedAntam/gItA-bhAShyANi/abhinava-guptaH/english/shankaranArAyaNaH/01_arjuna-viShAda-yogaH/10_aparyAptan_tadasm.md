1.10 Aparyaptam etc. For us, for Pandava army grauded by Bhimasena is
unlimited, i.e., it is not possible to vanish; or it is not sufficient,
i.e., very insignificant when compared with our army. This is the
meaning. On the other hand, for these Pandavas, this army guarded by
Bhisma, belonging to us, is limited i.e., it is possible to vanish; or
it is sufficient i.e., too much; in other words it is not possible to be
vanished in the war by these (Pandavas).
