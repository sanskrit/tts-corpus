14.14-15 Yada etc. Rajasi etc. When the Sattva is predominantly on the
increase on account of increase on account on account of incessantly
practising actions of the Sattva throughout the entire life-at that
\[time\] having met dissolution \[of body\], one attains the auspicious
worlds. Likewise whosoever has practised throughout his life the
activities of the Rajas, he, by his \[last\] journey attains manhood for
mixed enjoyment. Likewise : i.e. in the same order, if one practises
action of the Tamas alone by one's entire life, then \[on his death\] he
is rorn in the bodies of the hell, of the animals, of the trees and so
on. Those, who explain \[the passage under study to the effect\] :
'These results \[are for him in whom\] the Sattva etc., have
predominantly increased only at the time of death' - these commentators
have not correctly entered into (grasped) the behaviour of the embodied.
For, nothing but delusion arises, by all means at the last moment,
without exception in the case of one and all. However, with regard to
our explanation \[given above\] these passages and other verses (Ch.
VIII, 5ff) speak in one voice.
