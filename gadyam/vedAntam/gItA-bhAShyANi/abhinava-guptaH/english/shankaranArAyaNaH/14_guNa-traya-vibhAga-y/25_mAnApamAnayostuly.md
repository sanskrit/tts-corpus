14.23-25 Udasinavad etc. upto ucyate. He, who is ignorant i.e., he who
does not distinguish \[even the existence and nonexistence of the
Strands\] - he alone is wise, because of his correct knowledge. That is
why he is not shaken i.e., he does not fall from his own nature. The
means in this regard is the firm conviction : 'The exertion that \[in
found in my body etc.\] is nothing but the innate nature of the body,
the sense-organs etc.; and I am unconcerned with any fruit \[of any
action\]'.
