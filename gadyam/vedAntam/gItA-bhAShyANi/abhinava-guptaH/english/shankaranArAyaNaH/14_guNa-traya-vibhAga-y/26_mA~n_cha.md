14.26 Mam ca etc. By this \[verse the Lord\] teaches the basic means.
Here the word ca has been used in the sense of affirmation in exclusion
of all other things. \[So the meaning is\] : 'He, who serves Me
exclusively'. Hence, craving for fruits etc. \[of action\], whosoever
takes hold of that fruit as his principal aim, but Me (the Supreme) as a
subsidiary one-he is excluded by this interpretation. Because the
devotion of this person is not unfailing. For, he has consideration for
fruit \[alone\]. On the other hand, he who does not entertain any desire
for any fruit; who, even when estioned \[by somody as\] 'Why do you
under-take this desagreeable (foolish) act ;' would give reply by
silence alone, shedding tears that roll on his both the eyes wide open,
and having shake in body and bodily hair thrilled-\[all\] due to his
internal organ, agitated on account of being struck by the incessant
devotion towards the Bhagavat-it should be born in mind that this person
alone, not anybody else, in purified by the unfailing devotion which is
(nothing but) the foremost Energy (Grace) of the Bhagavat, the Supreme
Lord.
