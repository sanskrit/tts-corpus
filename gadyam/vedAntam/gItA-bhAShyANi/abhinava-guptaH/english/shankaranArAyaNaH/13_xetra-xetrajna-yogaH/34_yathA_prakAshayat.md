13.31-34 Yada etc. upto na upalipyate. When \[a man of Yoga\] perceives
the mutual difference i.e., separateness of all beings (all mutually
different beings) in the very Self on account of Its all pervasive
nature and realises the said difference as having sprung up from the
Self alone - even then he does not get any stain. For \[in that case\]
he would be the creator (or performer) of all. For, he is none but the
Supreme Self; and though residing in the body, he is not stained just as
the Eather is \[not stained\].
