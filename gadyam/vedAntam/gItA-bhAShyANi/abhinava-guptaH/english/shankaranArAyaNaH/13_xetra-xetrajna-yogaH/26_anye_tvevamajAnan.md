13.25-26 Dhyanena etc., Anye etc. A knowledge of this sort is the main.
\[For this end\] some practise religious meditation of the Self as Self;
others \[try\] by means of the Sankhya (knowledge) mentioned already
(Ch. V, 5ff), while still others \[strive\] through action. Still
others, bent upon hearing \[from the preceptors etc.\] practise the
religious meditation as they have heard, even though they do not
themselves know, (have) the knowledge of this kind. They too cross over
the death, i.e., the cycyle of birth and death. What is conveyed here is
this : The category Bhagavat, if mentally reflected upon by one means or
the other, does transport across \[the ocean of death circle\].
Therefore , let one remain in this fashion by all means.
