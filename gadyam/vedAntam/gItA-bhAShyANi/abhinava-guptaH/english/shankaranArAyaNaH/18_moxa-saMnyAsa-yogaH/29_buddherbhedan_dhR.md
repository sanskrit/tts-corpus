18.29 Buddheh etc. Intellect : the faculty of resolving. Content :
satisfaction. After having performed either good or wicked action,
everyone, at the end, feels 'what is to be necessarily performed has
been performed; so why furhter more ;' Or else what could be the cause
for \[one's\] retiring from that action ;' Therefore in every one there
is content. This is the meaning intended here. The word-meaning, that is
not clearly known-that alone is certainly explained \[hereinafter\].
