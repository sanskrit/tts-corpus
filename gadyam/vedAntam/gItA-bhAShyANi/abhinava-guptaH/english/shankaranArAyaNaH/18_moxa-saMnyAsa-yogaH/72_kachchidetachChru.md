18.68-72 Ya idam etc. upto Dhananjaya. The very act of explaining this
among My devotees is itself an act of cultivating devotion towards Me.
Whosoever shall declare etc : Whosoever directs the mind \[of the
devotees\] by face to face method, following the best procedure
prescribed in the scriptures; i.e., he who shall impart \[this
knowledge\] - he becomes one with Me. This is an injunction \[concerning
the result\] and not a sentence of praise. Likewise is \[the case\] in
other places also.
