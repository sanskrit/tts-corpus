18.4-11 Niscayam etc. upto abhidhiyate. The conclusion here is this :
Due to the manifoldness of the nature of the Strands, that have been
defined earlier, the act of relinishment itself is performed with a
certain mental disposition which is a modification of the Sattva, the
Rajas and the Tamas (the Strands). Because it reflects (is contaminated
by) the nature of the person having the same (the said mental
dispositon), what is called the real (unalloyed) relinishment is the
performance of the actions by the knowers of the Supreme Brahman by
giving up desire to achieve fruits and by avoiding the craving and
hatred on account of their eanimity to \[the pairs of opposites like\]
success and failure etc. That is why \[the Bhagavat\] says : 'By the act
of relinishment born of the Rajas or of the Tamas (Strands), no
connection with the fruit \[of relinishment\] is attained'. However, for
an act of relinishing, born of the Sattva (Strand), there is the fruit
in the form of honouring the purport of the scriptures. The application
of the term 'relinishment' stands to reason, in fact, only in the case
of a sage who has relinished his holding on the multitude of the
Strands.
