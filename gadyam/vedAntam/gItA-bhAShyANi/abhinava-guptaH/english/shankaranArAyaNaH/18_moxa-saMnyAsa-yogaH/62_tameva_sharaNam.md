18.61-62 Isvarah etc. Tam eva etc. This Lord, the Supreme Self, must be
taken hold of as refuge. When that Supreme Ruler, the \[real\]
Agent-of-all-actions, the \[real\] Knower, the very Self of your own, is
reflected upon, there (in the heart) the \[effects of\] actions do not
enjoy any locus standi. Indeed, the deer-calves which are of wavering
mind \[by nature\] and are noted only for their power of running away to
escape, do not take recourse to their skill in pursuing freely their
\[usual\] activities while there dwells in the \[nearby\] cave a
loin-calf, the glory of whose valour has been made evident by the
accessories in the form of the heaps of pearls scattered from the
elephants' temples broken upon with the very sharp edges of his
(lion-calf's) excellent claws. By the cocluding statement that commences
'To Him alone you must go for refuge' and \[runs\] as 'Through My Grace
etc.', the Bhagavat indicates the Lord Supreme Self, and Vasudeva krsna
to be identical.
