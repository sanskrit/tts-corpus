18.74-78 Ityaham etc. upto matir mama While concluding the
\[Krsna-Arjuna\] dialogue with Sanjaya's speech, the \[sage Vyasa\]
teaches this : What leads to the Absolute Brahman is nothing but the
recollection of the purport of the dialoguea recollection that is led
finally to the status of the highly vivid, direct cognition admitting no
differentiation \[between its subject and object\], resulting from the
continuity helped by the series of incessant contemplations \[on the
purport of the dialogue\] according to the method of firmly fixing.
Thus, only through the recollection of the dialogue of the Bhagavat and
Arjuna, the Reality could be reached and due to that come fortunes,
voctories and prosperity.
