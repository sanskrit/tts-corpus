18.66 Sarvadharman etc. Abandoning all attributes : This act of slaying
the kinsmen and the like that arises incidentally while fighting a war -
not owning those acts as your own attribute by your thought 'I am the
doer of all these'; also giving up by mind, the notion 'If the act of
slaying the teacher etc., is avoided, merit will accrue to me'. come to
Me: Come to Me alone, the Agent-of-all-actions, the Supreme Lord, the
Sovereign. As your Refuge : as the Guardian of all your natural
impulses. On that account I, the Omniscient, shall rescue you from all
the sins. Don't be sorrowful : Don't get perplexed 'What to be done'.
