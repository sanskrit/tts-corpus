9.22 Ananyah etc. \[See for example\] those who are different \[from the
above mentioned\] and who think of Me. How \[do they think\] ; They have
nothing else : They have no other fruit apart from Me to desire for.
Acisition : gaining (realising) My nature not gained (realised) earlier.
Security of acisition : protection of the already achieved gain of being
well established in the nature of the Bhagavat. On account of this there
may not be even a doubt regarding the fall from the Yoga. This is the
idea here.
