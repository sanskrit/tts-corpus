9.4 Maya etc. All beings exist in Me : Because no other abode of rest is
available, even if one wanders \[in search of it\] for long. The beings
(or elements) that form the objects of knowledge possess their
well-known nature of insentiency. When these beings manifest with this
nature foremost, their other innate nature viz., sentiency, that is
opposed to this \[former nature\], remain hidden. This is what He says
by I do not exist in them.
