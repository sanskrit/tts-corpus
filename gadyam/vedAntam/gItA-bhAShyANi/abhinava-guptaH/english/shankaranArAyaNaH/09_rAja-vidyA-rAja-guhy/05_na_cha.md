who are blind with nescience, do not see the reality. The ignorant do
not consider the Absolute Lord - Who is of the nature of infinite
Consciousness - as a basis of determinate knowledge of all objects. On
the other hand conceiving \[like\] 'I, the lean Devadatta, know this, as

signifies the Power \[of the Absolute\], because it is being employed.
This is indeed My Sovereignty, which is the Freedom of behaving in this
manner in a highly strange way. This is the idea (here).
