9.2 Raja-etc. Shines : that which illumines in the midst of all
sciences. Here \[in the Gita\] itself it is said 'The science of the
Self \[is the chief\] among the sciences'. Here in this science kings
like Janaka etc., have a right and pervilege (adhikara) \[to learn\]. It
is their secret, as it is much protected (by them) by heroism easy for
the Ksatriyas. As they do not waver \[in their mind\] because of their
heroic nature that is common in the members of the warring class, it is
very easy to do i.e., to observe. Imperishable : Unlike other actions
this action of worshipping Brahman does not perish through the enjoyment
of \[its result\].
