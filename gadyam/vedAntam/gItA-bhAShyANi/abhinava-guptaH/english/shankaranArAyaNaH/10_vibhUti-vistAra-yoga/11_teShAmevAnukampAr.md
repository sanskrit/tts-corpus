10.9-11 Maharsaya etc., upto bhasvata. Through the process of mutual
enlightening, the wisdom-shock is transmitted to each other. On account
of that, they get the all-inclusive \[knowledge\] 'Indeed all sentient
subjects are only a single Absolute Lord'. By means of this extensive
pervasion, they easily come to realise their own Self as Omnipotent and
omnipresent and by that they attain the Absolute Lordship. This is the
idea here.
