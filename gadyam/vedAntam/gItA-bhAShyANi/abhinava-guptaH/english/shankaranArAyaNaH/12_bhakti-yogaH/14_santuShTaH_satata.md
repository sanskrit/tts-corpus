12.13-14 Advesta etc. Santustah etc. \[Friend\] : he who has
friend-liness (or goodwill) i.e. unselfishness. In the same manner
'compassionate' \[is to be interpreted\]. 'These are mine' etc., is the
sence of 'mine' (or sense of possessiveness); 'I am generous', 'I am
powerful', 'I am victorious' etc., is the sense of 'I' (or egotism). In
whom these two are absent that man is free from the senses of 'mine' and
of 'I'. Forbearance : a thought that entertains no enmity even towards
an enemy who has \[actually\] injured. A man of Yoga at all times :
because his internal organ remains completely iet even at the stage of
his mundane dealings.
