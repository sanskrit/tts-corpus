The same purport is summed up -


12.12 Sreyah etc. Knowledge in the form of entering into \[the Lord\] is superior to practice; for practice bears that result. 

Due to the entering into the Lord, the meditation i.e., getting absorbed in the Bhagavat, becomes pre-eminent i.e., attains superiority, because of the achievement of what is desired. 

When meditation i.e., getting absorbed in the Bhagavat is accomplished, then it is possible to renounce fruits of actions. Otherwise how can there be a renunciation in what is unknown; 

When renunciation of fruits of actions is achieved, there arises an uninterrupted peace. 

Therefore, being the root of all \[these\], the knowledge a'one, in the form of fixing the mind in the Lord is important.
