12.6-8 Ye tu etc. upto asthitah. Those who renounce all (all actions) in
Me according to the instruction related above - of them I am the
redeemer from all the afflictions like obstacles \[on the way to
realisation\] etc. The act of causing the mind to enter \[into the
Supreme\] has been explained (under XII, 2 above). Therefore, this alone
is the highest form of Yoga, because it is natural. Hence \[I have
said\] in my Hymn : 'If, during \[one's\] concentration, reflecting with
high esteem and remaining in a \[particular\] posture, and the best
process (karana), a person causes a certain awakening to shine forth,
that is not the Consciousness of Yours (i.e. of the Goddess) that rises
up perennially and flows with its own (unadulterated) taste; for, here
(in the former) too the presence of the triad is distinctly felt. On the
other hand, when \[glowing\] without fuel; holding to its independence;
following horripilation, \[bodily\] shake and tears, \[all\] breaking
forth spontaneously; and clearly assuming the indifference \[even\] to
the body; the awakening fire of Consciousness suddely shines, on its own
accord simultaneously; then alone, O Goddess, that body of Yours, the
mightly Lord (Mahesa) is realised - a body which is devoid of \[all\]
supports, and which breaks the bondage of the dependent.' And so on.
