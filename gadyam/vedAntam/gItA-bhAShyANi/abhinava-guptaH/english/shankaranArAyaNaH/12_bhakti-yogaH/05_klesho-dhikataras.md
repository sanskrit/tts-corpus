contemplate on the Self as the motionless Brahman - by them also all the
attributes of Absolute Lord are superimposed on the Self - the
attributes that are indicated by the adjectives 'omni-present' etc.

attributes like absence-of-sin etc., and then comtemplate on It. Thus,
while without any effort \[on the part of the contemplator\] the Lord is
readily available with the greatness due to the host of
self-accomplished attributes, these persons undergo two-fold trouble.
