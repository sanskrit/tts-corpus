12.11 Atha etc. In case due to ignorance, you do not know the method,
enjoined in the scriptures and hence you are not able to perform actions
for the Lord, then renounce (dedicate) all that to Me, through offering
your own self \[to Me\]. This is the intention \[here\]. Holding the
same intention, I have myself declared in the Laghuprakriya as :
'Whatever action I have done, whether it is incomplete or superfluous,
not properly understood, bereft of a proper order of precedence, devoid
of \[good\] care, and full of slip of intellect; O Lord of All ! Please,
with mercy forgive all these of me, the afflicted and foolish devotee of
Yours; for you are compassionate; With this prayer-Yoga, I offer myself
to You \[so that\] I do not become a receptacle of miseries again
unnecessarily.' the same idea may be observed in the scriptural texts of
the Siddhanta \[system\] - that have the Supreme Lord as their subject
matter - while they speak of offering oneself \[to the Lord\].
