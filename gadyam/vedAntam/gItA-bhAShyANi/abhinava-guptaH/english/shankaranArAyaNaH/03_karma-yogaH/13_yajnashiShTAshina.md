3.13 Yajnasista-etc. Those who enjoy the pleasures of obects that have
come to them on the authority of laws enjoining what is to be
necessarily performed; and who enjoy them viewing \[the enjoyment\] only
as a secondary (or intermediate) action and conseently as a subsidiary
having no separate purpose; and again those who enjoy the remnant of the
necessary action in the form of gratifying the group of the devas of the
snese-organs-that residue of food marked with bliss in being firmly
established in their own Self - that is to say, those who have mounted
upon the Self and are desirous of enjoying objects only as a means to
achieve this end - they are freed from all faults of good and bad.
Those, who for their own selves etc. : On the other hand, those who
believe, under the influence of ignorance, the sheer superficial
enjoyment of objects as their final goal, and act with the notion 'We
perform this \[act\] for the sake of ourselves' - those persons alone
gain the sin in the form of good and bad.
