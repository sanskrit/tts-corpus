3.4-5 Na karmanam etc Na hi etc. Knowledge, deserted by action, does not
exist; and the action, combined with dexterity does not exist, \[if it
is\] deserted by knowledge. Therefore knowledge and action constitute
one and the same thing. Hence it has been delclared : 'Knowledge is not
deserted by action and action is not deserted by knowledge. \[Hence\] a
teacher who is well accomplished in knowledge and action, is the cutter
of the fetters of the fettered'. Therefore the action that is included
within the knowledge cannot be avoided. For, the body, the organ of
speech and the mind are, by nature, in a perpetual motion; and hence an
individual, being simply under the control of other than himself,
necessarily performs one action or the other. For, the body, the
speech-organ and the mind are of the nature of throbing.
