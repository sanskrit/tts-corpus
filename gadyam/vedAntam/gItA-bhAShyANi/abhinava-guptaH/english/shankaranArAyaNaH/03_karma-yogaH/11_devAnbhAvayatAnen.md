3.11 Devan etc. Devas : Those that have a tendency of playing i.e., the
deities who preside over the organs and who dwell in the senses (or who
are nothing but the sensitive faculty of the senses) and who are
well-known in the Rahasyasastra. 'You must gratify these deities by this
action i.e., feed them compability with sense-objects. Then, being
satisfied, let these deities gratify (cause) you to have emancipation
suitable exclusively to the intrinsic nature of the Self. For, \[then
alone you attain\] a capacity to remain in your own Self. Thus when the
mutual gratification - you gratifying the \[deities of the\] senses, and
they letting \[you\] be absorbed in the Self - in the uninterruped
series of periods of being extrovert and of meditation, you shall soon
undoubtedly attain the highest good i.e., the Supreme that is marked
with the total disappearance of \[all\] mutual differences.' This path
of the said nature is to be followed not merely for emancipation, but
also for gaining all super - human powers (or success siddhi). This
\[the Lord\] says -
