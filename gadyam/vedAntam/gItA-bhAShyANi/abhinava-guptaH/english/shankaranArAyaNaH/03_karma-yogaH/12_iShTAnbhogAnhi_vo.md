3.12 Istan etc. \[The deities of\] the senses, gratified by the necessry
actions, bind \[the aspirant's mind\] to the state of remaining firm on
some object of meditation. Therefore when they are at work, the things,
i.e., the objects are granted \[to him\] by none but the \[deities of
the\] senses, through recollection, resolution, meditation etc., of
their objects. If these objects are not offered for the enjoyment of the
deities, then it would amount to the status of a theif i.e., to an act
of thief, because he is acting deceitfully. Indeed it has already been
declared by the Bhagavat that 'He is called a man of deluded action'.
Therefore the idea in the passage \[under study\] is this : Whosoever is
desirous of attaining by easy means, the supernatural power \[like anima
etc.\], or of attaining emancipation, he should enjoy the objects as and
when they are brought, \[and enjoy\] just with the aim of simply
alliviating the impatience of the \[deities of the\] senses.
