3.34-35 Indriyasya etc., Sreyan etc. A person living the worldly life
does entertain likes or dislikes towards every sense-object. For, due to
his total ignorance he imagines that actions are performed only by his
Self. Thus there is this difference between a man of knowledge and a man
of worldly life, eventhough they perform alike their \[respective\]
worldly activities such as eating etc. The established view of ours \[in
this regard\] is this : For a person, who, freed from attachment in
every way, Performs his own duty, there is hardly any bond of merit or
demerit. Indeed one's own duty never disappears from one's heart and it
is certainly rooted there deeply as a natural taste. Not a single
creature is born without that. Hence it should not be given up.
