3.37 Kama esah etc. A total absence of difference among these two
(desire and wrath) is indicated by the word esah 'this' twice uttered.
These desire and wrath are ever interrelated and remain in an
inseparable mutual co-existence. Hence \[the Lord\] well describes them
only as identical. This is a swallower i.e., a devouer of the morsel of
festival i.e., the happiness. The wrath alone is a bestower of sins as
it is the cause of great sins. This is man of intelligence should view
to be an enemy.
