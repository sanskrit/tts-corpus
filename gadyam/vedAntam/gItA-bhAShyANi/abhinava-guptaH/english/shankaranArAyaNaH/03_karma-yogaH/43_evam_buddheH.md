3.42-43 Indriyani etc. Evam etc. 'Because the sense-organs are different
from the sense-objects that indicate the foe \[in estion\]; from them
the mind is different; from that too different is the intellect; what is
instrinsically different from the intellect also is the Self; so due to
wrath, risen at the sense-organs, how can there be a disturbance in the
mind, in the intellect or in the Self ;' Let one contemplate in this
manner. This is what is meant here. This is intention of the experts of
the Rahasya \[literature\] : The Supreme I-consciousness viz., the
awareness 'All I am', which remains beyond the intellect, and the
essence of which allows no difference-that is indeed the highest
identity. Therefore no furstration (or cut) can be for That which is
complete all around; hence wrath etc., do not rise \[in It\]. Therefore,
taking hold of the Supreme Energy which in essence is Consciousness, you
must slay the foe, the wrath which is ignorance in essence.
