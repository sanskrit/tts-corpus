8.17-19 Sahasra-etc., upto aharagama. Those who could see afar (great
seers), see \[actually\] the night and day even in the case of Brahma as
being marked \[respectively\] by the destruction and creation \[of the
world\]. Accordingly, having risen from sleep, the same \[Selves\]
continue their own respective activities every day; they theyselves,
putting an end to their activities every night, remain exclusively in
the form of Energy \[of the Absolute\]. In this manner they come to be
again and again at the time of creation and of dissolution. No new, but
only the self-same personal Souls are let loose. Their mutual difference
in the form of the idea of the long and short lives is based only on the
concept of time. This delimitation is unavoidable even in the case of
the Prajapatis. Hence it is established that they too are cetainly of
the nature of having evolution and dissolution. \[The Lord\] clarifies
His \[own\] statement : 'People do return from each and every world; but
having attained Me, the Supreme Lord, they do not do so.'
