8.3 Aksaram etc. the Supreme is \[called\] Brahman because It is big and
causes everything to grow \[in It\]. On the same ground, what is termed
'as the Lord-of-self' is that thing which bears the name Consciousness
which never ceases to be in It (Brahman) and which is nothing but the
Brahman (svah bhavah). This Brahman, which is nothing but Consciousness,
embraces the Power of \[creating\] the universe because of Its unlimited
aspect of being external; and on account of Its freedom in the form of
supremacy there arises the emitting (i.e. creative) activity \[in it\]
in the form of manifesting Itself as the external inanimate beings and
also as various external animate ones. \[These two aspects of\] this
activity cause respectively the birth of the inanimate beings - i.e. the
insentient beings, and the animate ones i.e. the sentient beings like
Brahman etc. \[In other words\], It manifests as varigated insentient
and sentient beings. Again this activity bestows on what is real, its
intrinsic nature i.e. creates a reality for the one from which all that
is false is excluded. this emitting activity is what is known as
'action'.
