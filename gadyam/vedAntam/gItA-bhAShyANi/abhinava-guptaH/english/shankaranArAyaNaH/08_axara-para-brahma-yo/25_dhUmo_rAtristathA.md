8.24-25 Agnih etc. Dhumah etc. Northern : upper (or upward). Course :
the one taken \[by the sun\] during the period of six months. This
course, on account of its illuminating nature, is figuratively described
by the words denoting fire etc., and the course, contrary to this, by
opposite terms. This course is intercepted with the lunar parts of
enjoyment. Hence \[it leads to\] the return for enjoyment.
