7.27 Iccha-etc. \[At the time of destruction\] he (the personal Soul) is
led to expand exceedingly, while he still remains unconcious on account
of his desire, aversion, agner, dellusion etc. On account of this, the
entire world takes recourse to the sleeping stage while it continues to
exist in its entirity within the stomach of the Prakrti (the Prime
Casue); and to exist just being (temporarily) not capable of performing
its activities. For, as long as there is delusion, the mental
impressions are to be experienced, as in the case of the sleeping stage
in the night time every day. But on that account no emancipation is
gained. For, when the experience of loss of unconsciousness is over
(i.e., when consciousness is regained), again the mundane life with its
varieties of activites is found.
