7.30 Yesam etc. upto yukta-cetasah. Those, in whom the darkness
(ignorance) has totally vanished, and the Self is well secured due to
the decaying of the good and bad effects of actions-they break off the
canopy of their \[castle of the\] mighty delusion and realise everything
as the Brahman studded (purified) with the rays of the Bhagavat,
emerging out of the darkness of old age and death; and realise 'what
governs the Self, the beings, the deities and the sacrifices are all My
own different aspects'. They also experience Me at the time of their
journey, on account of their having internal organ permanently immersed
in the thought of the Bhagavat. For, those who remember the Bhagavat
even earlier, since their birth-they at the last momnet would very well
remember the Absolute Lord. \[Hence\] it is good to simply keep silent
with regard to those who opine 'What is the use of worshiping since
\[the time of\] birth ;'
