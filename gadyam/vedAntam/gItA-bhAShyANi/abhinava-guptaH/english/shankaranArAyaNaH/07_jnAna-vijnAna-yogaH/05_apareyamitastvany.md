7.4-5 Bhumih etc. Apard etc. \[The demonstrative\] 'this' denotes what
is being perceived \[as objects\] through sense-organs by all men at the
stage of mundane life. This is only one and at the same time is divided
eigth-fold. Therefore the universe is one and unitary, because it is
made of one single material cause. By this statement, monism is
demonstrated even while following the Prakrti theory. The selfsame
Prakrti has become the living one i.e., the personal Soul. Hence it is
superior \[to what has become eight-fold\]. It also belongs to Me alone
and not to anybody else. This Prakrti is \[thus\] two-fold and varied in
the form of the universe consisting of the knowables and the knower.
That is why this Prakrti (the basic material nature), being the
substratum of all beings reflected on the surface of the clean mirror,
viz., the Self , is nothing but Self's own nature and \[hence\] never
leaves Him. This world : the Earth etc. \[mentioned in the 4th verse\].
