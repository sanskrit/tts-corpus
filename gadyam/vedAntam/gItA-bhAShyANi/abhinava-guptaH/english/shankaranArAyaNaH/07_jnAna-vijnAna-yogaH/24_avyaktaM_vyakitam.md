7.24 Avyaktam etc. Becuase of their poor intellect, these \[worshippers
of other deities\] do not at all recognise the unmanifest and ultimately
true nature of Mine. On the contrary, they conceive Me merely as one,
possessing only a manifest form with a particular knowledge and a
particular innage nature, all suitable to their own desires. \[They
think\] not otherwise. That is why, no name or form \[of a deity\] is
insisted upon \[by the Lord\]. However, this is the established view
\[of the teachers of the school\] in this regard : If a person holds
fast to a specific form of a deity in order to get rid of desires, that
\[itself\] results in his becoming pure and emancipated. If the case is
reversed, \[the result\] would be a contrary one.
