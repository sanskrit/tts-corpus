7.6-7 Etadyonini etc. Mattah etc. Keep them nearby : You should place
them in your neihbourhood following the method of experience augmented
by practice. Or \[it may mean that\] You should bear in mind that I, the
Vasudeva, am both the origin and destruction of all beings. What is
indicated by 'I' is this : Even though \[it is viewed that\] the
Absolute (Isvara) is distinct from the Prakrti, Soul and Supreme Soul,
It remains by all means immanent in all; hence there is no room for the
theory of dualism of the Sankhya and the Yoga schools. Just as the
pearls on the string. Just as the string does exist unobserved in the
interior \[in a necklace\] though its form remains undetected, in the
same fashion I remain in all.
