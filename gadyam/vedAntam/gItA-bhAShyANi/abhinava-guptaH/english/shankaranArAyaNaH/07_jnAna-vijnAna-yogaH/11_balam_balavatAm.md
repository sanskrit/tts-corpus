7.10-11 Bijam etc. Balam etc. The seed : the subtle prime cause. The
strength, free from desire and attachment : It is of the nature of
vigour and is capable of supporting all that exist. Deire : the Will,
which is nothing but Pure Consciousness and which is not opposed to any
of the attributes (its objects) like pot, cloth etc. For, the Will,
because it is the \[conscious\] energy of the Bhagavat, is immanent in
all and nowhere is it opposed, eventhough it is being differentiated
(i.e. the wills or desires are classified) on account of its attributes
like pot, cloth etc., which are \[only\] accidental. Thus the wise,
because they are devoted to this Will, are of the nature of Pure
Consciousness. That has been said also in the Sivopanisad as - '\[A man
of wisdom\] would concentrate his mind on the Will or \[Self\]
Consciousness that arises'. (VB, 98) \[Here in this otation\] that
arises means 'that has just risen but has not yet spread outside.'
Ignoring this way of interpretation \[of the Gita passage\] some
interpret it so as to bring out the idea 'He would enjoy the group of
the three, not hindering mutually'. These (commentators) are ignorant of
the customs (karma) sanctioned by the traditions; yet they interpret the
secret about the Absolute ! No doubt they deserve \[our\] salutation.
