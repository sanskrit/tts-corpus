7.16-19 Caturvidhah etc., upto sudurlabhah. Those who worship Me are men
of good action. They are of four types. All these are noble ones. For,
other persons, mean-minded as they are, beg a cure of their affliction,
and money etc., from persons who have hands, feet, stomach, body and
intelligence (or bodily strength) that are eal to their (the beggers)
own, or even from those who are very much inferior. But, by comparison
with the man of wisdom, \[the other three under estion\] are of inferior
intelligence. For, they entertain, at that sage too, a sense of duality.
Becuase, a sense of duality 'I seek this from the Bhagavat' is clearly
discernible in them. On the other hand, the man of wisdom hangs on Me
alone with a sense of identity \[of him with Me\]. Hence, I am verily
indentical with him. It is I alone, and not \[any other\] gain, that is
dear to him. That is why he is having a mind purified by the firm
conviction 'All is nothing but Vasudeva'.
