7.14 Daivi etc. Deva means 'one who plays'. What is born of (or exists
in) him is daivi 'play'. Hence, the meaning is : 'This is My play'. Due
to this \[play-trick\], the \[Strands\] Sattva etc., even though they
are not really different from the Supreme Brahman, the Pure
Consciousness, manifest as different from That. This \[differentiation\]
itself accounts for their secondary nature i.e., the nature of being an
object of enjoyment i.e., being dependent on the existence of the
enjoyer. This peculiarity of dual-nature is inexplicable for the persons
of mundane life. Hence to them it is a trick-of-Illusion. Therefore,
those who have realised the light of the Brahman, the Supreme Reality,
and find the universe as not distinct from that \[Brahman\], they
\[alone\] cross over the trick-off-Illusion which is of the nature of
manifesting in duality and is in the form of the dependent status of the
Strands, Sattva etc. This is the idea indicated by 'alone' in 'Me
alone'. On the other hand those who would find just the manifestation of
duality as they \[appear to\] exist - they do not across over the
trick-of-Illusion. Thus it is rightly said 'I am not in them (in the
beings of the Sattva etc.) etc.'
