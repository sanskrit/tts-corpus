7.9 Punyah etc. By its own nature pure is that smell which exists in the
earth as its exclusive property. The foulness, the excessiveness \[of th
smell\] are due to contamination of other elements. That has been stated
\[elsewhere\] as : '\[A particular thing\] becomes hard because of the
excess of the properties of the earth; foul-smelling on account of the
rise of the fire-properties; and stiff due to liberality (excess) of the
properties of water' and so on.
