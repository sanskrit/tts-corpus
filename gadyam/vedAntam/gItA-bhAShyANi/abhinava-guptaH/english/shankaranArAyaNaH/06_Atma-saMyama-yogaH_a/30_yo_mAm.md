6.30 Yo Mam etc. Loss : i.e., on account of serving no purpose \[on the
part of a thing\]. For example : He who does not see the all-pervasive
nature of the Supreme Self, from him the Supreme Self has fled away,
because It does not reveal Its own nature. Further, this aggregate of
objects, which is being perceived, remains settled down in the Supreme
Self, which is the very nature of their illumination (being known). Now,
whosoever fails to veiw the object as such, he gets lost from the naute
of that Supreme Self. For, nothing shines without It. On the other hand,
he who finds Me (the Supreme Consciousness) as immanent in all - for him
I am not lost; because I appear \[to him\] in my own nature. \[Again\],
when he perceives objects in Me-when his perceiverhood is complete on
account of the possibility of illumination and manifestation of these
objects due to This - then he is not lost for the Supreme Self.
