6.16-17 Yogosti etc. Yuktahara etc. For foods : for sense-objects that
are being brought \[by sense-organs\]. Effort : activity for enjoying
\[them\]. Its appropriateness is neither to have unlimited indulgence,
nor to have unlimited abstention. The same is in all cases. The rest
\[of the text\] is clear. On the authority of the Sage \[Vyasa\], the
form jagaratah etc. \[may be viewed correct\] as those in the Vedic
literature. The same is in other similar instances also.
