6.26-28 Yatah etc. upto adhigacchati. From whatever objects the mind
returns, immediately after its return, let him ieten it on the Self.
Otherwise, being not firmly established \[in the Self\], the mind would
again take hold of nothing but the sense-objects. But the Bliss,
assuming the roll of an agent (or subject, kartv-bhuta) comes to the
object (karmabhuta), viz., the man-of-Yoga, whose mind remains ite in
the Self. By this way alone the men-of-Yoga attain the Brahman easily
and not by \[any\] difficult Yoga etc. This is the idea \[here\].
