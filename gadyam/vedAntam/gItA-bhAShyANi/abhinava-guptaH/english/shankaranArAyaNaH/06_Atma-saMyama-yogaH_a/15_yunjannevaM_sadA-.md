6.10-15 Yogi etc. upto adhigacchati. Self : the mind. Let him yoke it :
let him make it single-pointed. Always : not for a limited period of
time. If the conditions like remaining alone etc., are fulfilled, this
\[controlling of mind\] is possible and not otherwise. On account of the
firmness of seat, the time-nerve (or the body ;) remains firm and due to
this, mind remains firm. He, by whom the mental activities i.e., those
that are in the form of intention, and other activities of the
sense-organs are subdued i.e., are brought under full control; \[he is
the person of the subdued mental and sensual activities\]. Holding :
i.e., with effort. If the nose-tip is looked at, \[it is possible\] not
to look at \[different\] directions. Let him remain endowed with the
state of having Me alone as supreme goal. This is the meaning \[here\].
He who yokes i.e., concentrates his self (mind) in this manner, there
arises for him Peace in which the culmination - as far as the end-is the
same as attaining Me.
