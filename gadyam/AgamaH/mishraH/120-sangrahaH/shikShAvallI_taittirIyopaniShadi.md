Ever since I read Radhakrishnan's translation of the `Principal  
Upanishads,' one of his comments has stuck to my mind.  
There is a passage in the Taittiriya Upanishad, which is an address  
by the Teacher to his students as they left the Gurukula, beginning with  
`satyam vada, dharma.n chara......' Radhakrishnan noted that this is a  
convocation address by the Vice-Chancellor that is still observed at  
the Banaras Hindu University.  
(At one time he was its President, and I don't know if in his modesty   
he did not say whether he introduced the practice.)  
This could be one of our pages to memorize.  
  
Wherever I have been asked to say a few words at a graduation party,   
I have used this to keep my speech short !!
