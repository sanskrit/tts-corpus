<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When the fruit of the *kataka* tree is put in dirty water, the water
becomes clarified, takes the clear form. But it does not become clear by
the mere mention of the name of that fruit; it needs *action*.
Similarly, the wearing of external marks is like the pronouncing of the
name of the fruit; and success is attained, not by that wearing alone,
but by the due fulfilment of such duties as ‘resting in solitude’,
‘meditation’, ‘equal-mindedness towards all beings’ and so forth.

This verse is a laudatory supplement to what has gone before.—(67)
