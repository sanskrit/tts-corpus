भिक्षाभोजनपात्रं **कपालं** कर्परम् । निकेतो **वृक्षमूलानि** । **कुचैलं** स्थूलजीर्णवस्त्रखण्डम् । **समता** शत्रौ मित्रे उभयरूपरहिते स्वात्मनि च । **मुक्तस्य लक्षणम्** । अचिरप्राप्यता मोक्षस्योच्यते, न पुनर् इयतैव मुक्तो भवति ॥ ६.४४ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The ‘*potsherd*’—the broken jar—shall be his dish and his
begging-bow;—The ‘*roots of trees*’ shall be his home.

‘*Coarse cloth*’—Rough and torn pieces of doth.

‘*Equality*’—towards the friend and the enemy, to one who is neither a
friend nor an enemy, as well as towards himself.

‘*Mark of the liberated person*’. What this means is that to such a man
liberation is quickly attained; not that the man becomes liberated by
these alone.—(44).

cow. He shall dwell at the extremity of the village, in a temple, or in
an empty house, or at the root of a tree. He should not be crooked in
bis ways; he should not observe the rules of impurity on account of
deaths or births; he should not have a house; he should he of
concentrated mind.’

044	A potsherd (instead of an alms-bowl), the roots of trees (for a dwelling), coarse worn-out garments, life in solitude and indifference towards everything, are the marks of one who has attained liberation.
