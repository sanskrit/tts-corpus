‘*Prodigies*’—appearing in the heaven, in the atmosphere and on the
earth, *e.g*., eclipess, the appearance of particular planets, the
appearance of a comet, reddening of the atmosphere, earthquake and so
forth. The man shall not go about describing the probable effects of
these, for the purpose of obtaining alms.

‘*Portents*’—the evil effects of planetary aspects.

‘*Science of astrology*’— the science which enables one to say—‘To-day
the moon is in the asterism of *Kṛttikā*, which is fit for starting on a
journey and so forth.

‘*Science of palmistry*’— which describes the effect of marks in the
palms and other parts of the body.

‘*Counsel*’— offering advice to the King and his subjects,—in such form
as ‘It is right to act in this manner,—make peace with this King—declare
war with that—why did you do this?—why don’t you do this?’

‘*Discussion*’— the urging of arguments in sheer arrogance, for and
against certain doctrines in regard to which there is difference of
opinion.—(50)

in ancient as in modern times, ascetics followed worldly pursuits and
were the teachers and advisers of the people”.

This verse is quoted in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 86).
