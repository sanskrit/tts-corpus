चक्षुषा मार्गं निरूप्य यस्मिन् प्रदेशे प्राणिनः पीडां न गच्छन्ति तत्र पादं निदध्यात् । **सत्यां वाचं वदेद्** इति सिद्धे **पूत**ग्रहणं सत्यशब्दस्योपलक्षणताम् दर्शयति । तेनापविद्धं भवति । मनसा पूतो **मनःपूतः** सदा स्यात् । परद्रवाभिध्यानादि न कुर्यात् ॥ ६.४६ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Having looked over the path with the eye, he should place his foot on a
spot where there may be no animals to suffer from his tread.

It being already known that one should tell the truth, the term
‘*pūta*’, ‘*sanctified*’, is meant to show that the term ‘*satya*’,
‘*truth*’, is purely indicative; hence there is nothing incongruous in
this.

One shall always remain *pure in his mind*; *i.e*. he shall not even
think of possessing what belongs to another and so forth.—(46)
