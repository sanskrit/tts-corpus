This being a distinct stage of life, people might think that such duties
as Vedic Study and the like, which pertain to other life-stages, should
have to be omitted now; hence with a view to show that they do not
cease, the Text has added—‘*always engaged*’; and not as in the
Householder’s stage, during which, the man being busy with his household
work, their performance leaves no time for Vedic study and such duties.

‘*Meek*’—endowed with humility; free from haughtiness.

‘*Conciliatory*’—abounding in the friendly spirit; always saying what is
agreeable and wholesome; ever ready to conciliate his neighbour.

‘*Quiet*.’—Even when urged by others, he should not speak much of what
may be irrelevant.

‘*Ever liberal*’—in making gifts of water, fruits and roots and alms.

‘*Not accepting* any *gifts*’—He should not beg anything for his
medication or diet and such needs, from a person belonging to another
stage of life and coming to see him.

‘*Compassionate towards all living beings*’—‘Compassion’ is *pity*. But
even though he be compassionate, he should not, for the sake of any
person, beg anything from another person.—(8).

‘*Dāntaḥ*’—‘Self-controlled, free from pride’ (Medhātithi and
Nārāyaṇa);—‘patient with hardships’ (Kullūka).

enjoy no pleasures, have no protector, observe silence, uttering speech
only on the occasion of the daily recitation of the Veda.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (9.8).—‘He shall only give, not receive, presents.’

*Viṣṇu* (94-6).—‘He must not relinquish the private recitation of the
Veda.’

desisting from accepting presents, studying the Veda, charitable,
devoted to the welfare of all living beings.’
