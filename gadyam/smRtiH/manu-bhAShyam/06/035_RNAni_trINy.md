One shall turn his mind towards Liberation only after having paid off the three debts; without having paid them, if he seeks for Liberation, he sinks downwards.—(35)

अपाकरणम् ऋणसंशुद्धिः । **मनो मोक्षे नेवेशयेत्** । मोक्षशब्देन प्रव्रज्याश्रमो लक्ष्यते । तत्र प्राधान्येन मोक्षैकफलतोच्यते । न तथान्येष्व् आश्रमेषु । ततो मोक्षः परिव्राज्या ॥ ६.३५ ॥

_कानि पुनस् तानि त्रीणि ऋणान्य् अत आह ।_

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Paying off*’— Clearing off the debt.

‘*One shall turn his mind towards Liberation*’.—The term ‘liberation’
here indicates the stage of Renunciation; it is this stage that is
spoken of as the principal path which leads to Liberation only; not so
the other stages (which lead to other results also); hence
‘*liberation*’ means the *Stage of Renunciation*.—(35).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.57), to the effect that until
one has begotten offsprings he is not entitled to the life of
Renunciation;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 373);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p.
808), which says that ‘*mokṣa*’ here stands for *jñāna*, knowledge, as
is clear from the use of the term ‘*sevamānaḥ*’—and in
*Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 3) along with the next verse (see below).

*Smṛtyantara* (Aparārka, p. 966).—‘Having paid off the three debts,
being freed from all motions of *I* and *mine*, the Brāhmaṇa, the
Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya may go forth from the house.’
