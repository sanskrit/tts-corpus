He should wear either skin or a bit of cloth; he shall bathe in the evening, as also in the meaning; he shall always wear matted locks, as also beard, hair on his body and nails.—(6)

**चर्म** गोमृगादीनाम् । **चीरं** वस्त्रखण्डम् । **सायं** दिवसावसानसमयः । **प्रगे** चाह्नः प्रथमोदये । एवं सायं स्नानविधानाद् रात्रौ भोजनम् अस्याहुः, भुक्ते स्नानप्रतिषेधात् । 

- <u>तद् अयुक्तम्</u> इत्य् अन्ये । यतः स्नातकव्रतम् "अतः स्नानम् आचरेद् भुक्त्वा" इति । महाभारते तु पुरुषमात्रधर्मतया स्मर्यते । त्रैकालिकम् अप्य् अस्य स्नानं भविष्यति वैकल्पिकम् । 

- **जटाश्मश्रुलोकनखानि** न कर्तयेत् ॥ ६.६ ॥

*Skin*—of the bull, the deer and other such animals.

‘*Cīra*’—a bit of cloth.

^(‘)*Evening*’—end of the day.

‘*Morning*’—opening of the day.

This rule regarding bathing in the evening implies that the man is to
eat at night only; because Bathing after meals is forbidden.

This view, some say, is not right; because among the observances of the
Accomplished Student, it is said that ‘after taking his food he shall
bathe’ (which shows that bathing after meals is not entirely forbidden),
in fact this bathing after meals is declared in the *Mahābhārata* as to
be done by each and every person.

It is open to the Hermit to bathe thrice during the day—this being a
matter of option.

‘*Matted locks*, *beard, hairs on the body and nails*’;—all this he
shall not have cut.—(6)

‘*Cīram*’—‘*Vastrakhaṇḍa*, tattered garment’ (Medhātithi, and
Govindarāja);—‘dress of bark’ (Nārāyaṇa, Rāghavānanda and Kullūka, to
whom last Buhler wrongly attributes the former explanation).

The second half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.46).
