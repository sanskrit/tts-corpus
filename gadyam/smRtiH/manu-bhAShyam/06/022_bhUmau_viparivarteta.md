**विपरिवर्तनं** केवलायां भूमाव् एकेन पार्श्वेन निषद्य पुनः पार्श्वान्तरेणावस्थानम् । आहारविहारकालौ वर्जयित्वा एवं वर्तेत, नोपविशेन् न चक्रमेत्[^६] न शय्यायां नासने न भित्तौ निषीदेद् इत्य् अर्थः । **प्रपदैः** पादाग्रैर् **वा तिष्ठेत्** । **स्थानासनाभ्यां** च दिने । रात्रौ तु केवलस्थण्डिलशायितां वक्ष्यति । **सवनेषु** प्रातर्मधन्दिनापराह्णेषु **उपयन्न् अप** इति च । असंभवे नद्यादीनाम् उद्धृतोदकेनापि स्नानं दर्शयति ॥ ६.२२ ॥

‘*Rolling about*’— Lying down on the ground on one side for sometime and
then turning over on the other side. He shall pass his time thus rolling
about, except during meal-time and the time during which he has to move
about, he shall neither sit down nor walk about, nor sit on a bed, or a
seat, or a parapet.

‘*On tip-toe*’—‘*prapadaiḥ*’.—‘He shall stand’.

‘*By standing and sitting*’.—During the day; as for the night, it is
going to be declared that the man should sleep on the bare ground.

‘*At the savanas*.’—*i.e*., in the morning, at midday and in the
evening; —‘*going to water*’.—This indicates that where a river or some
such reservoir of water is not available, one may perform his bath even
with water pulled out (of a well).—(22).
