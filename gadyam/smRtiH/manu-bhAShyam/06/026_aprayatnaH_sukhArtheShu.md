Making no effort to obtain pleasure-giving objects, and maintaining celibacy, he shall sleep on the ground; and not caring for shelter, he shall have the roots of trees for his dwelling.—(26).

सुखप्रयोजनेषु वस्तुषु प्रयत्नं न कुर्यात् । आतपपीडितः छायां नोपसर्पेत् । शीतार्दितो नाग्निं समिन्धीत । यदि तु दैवोपपादितादित्यतापादिना शीतादिदुःखनिवृत्तिर् भवतीत्य् अत्रैव दुःखापनोदः क्रियते, न निषिध्यते । वर्षादिकालाद् अन्यत्रैतद् विधीयते, तत्र प्रतिपन्नस्य धर्मस्य विधानात् । 

- <u>अथ वा</u> व्याधितस् तस्यौषधप्रयत्नो निवार्यते । व्याधिनिवृत्तिर् अपि सुखम् उच्यते । अतस् तन्निवृत्त्यर्थं यत्नं न कुर्यात् । 

- **धराशयः** केवलैस् तृणैर् आच्छादिते स्थण्डिले शयीत । **शरणेष्व्** आश्रयेषु गृहवृक्षमूलादिषु ममकारम् आत्मीयाभिनिवेशं न कुर्यात् । वृक्षमूलानि निकेतं गृहस्थानीयं कुर्यात् । तद् असंभवे शिलातलगुहादयो ऽपि विहिताः ॥ ६.२६ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

He shall make no effort to obtain things that give pleasure; *e.g*.,
troubled by heat, he shall not move into the shade, and troubled by
cold, he shall not kindle fire. If, however, his sufferings are removed
by such natural causes as the falling of the sun’s rays and the
like,—this is not forbidden. This rule refers to seasons other than the
rains; because special rules have been prescribed with special reference
to this latter Reason.

Or, the text may be taken as prohibiting the use of medicines by the
hermit if he happen to fall ill,—being cured of disease also being a
kind of ‘pleasure;’ hence he shall not make any effort to secure this
pleasure.

‘*Sleeping on the ground*’;—*i.e*., he shall sleep on the ground,
covered only with grass.

‘*Shelter*’— dwelling-places, such as houses, tree-roots and so
forth;—for these he shall not care; he shall not have any hankering
after the possession of these.

He shall make the roots of trees his dwelling. In the event of their
being not available, stone-slabs, mountain-caves and such places have
also been ordained for him.—(26).
