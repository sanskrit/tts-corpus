<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This teaches the cultivation of a mental disposition.

It is not by the abandoning of the acquisition of desired things that
one becomes ‘free from longings’; he becomes so only when he renounces
what forms the source of all longing.

‘*Disposition*’ is an attribute of the mind, or of the soul, in the form
of *desire*..

‘*Towards all things’—‘sarvabhāveṣu*.’— This second ‘*bhūva*’ denotes
*things*. The presence of the epithet ‘*all*’ implies that *attachment*
to even such necessary things as articles of food and drink which are
required for the maintenance of the body, is to be deprecated and not
the *desire*. Because the *desire* for such things, in the form of
hunger and thirst, arises from the very nature of things and is bound to
appear. But ‘desire’ is something different from ‘longing’: *Longing*
arises from attachment and is demeaning; while *desire* for food & c.
appears in the man naturally, after the digestion of what has been eaten
and drunk.—(80)
