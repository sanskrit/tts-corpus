<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

If at the stated time he should fail to obtain food, he shall not be
‘*sorry*,’ dejected in mind. He shall not allow grief or joy to overtake
him at failing or succeeding to obtain food.

‘*What suffices to sustain his life*.’—This indicates the quantity of
food to be begged. What this implies is that in the event of his failing
to obtain alms, he shall sustain his life by such fruits, roots and
water as do not belong to another person.

‘*Accessories*’— vessels, staff and so forth;—‘*attachment to
these*’—*i*. *e*., making special efforts to obtain them;—from this he
should he ‘*free*’; that is he shall harbour no longings.—(57)

‘*Mātrā*’—‘Implements, vessels, staff and so forth’ (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘portion, mouthful’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 963), which explains ‘*mātrā*’
as ‘*upakaraṇadravyam*, accessories’;—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra,
p. 563), which explains ‘*mātrā*’ etymologically as ‘*mīyante iti*’, as
meaning ‘objects’; since he is free from attachment to all objects,
therefore he should be neither glad at getting them nor sorry at not
getting them.

*Mahābhārata* (12.278.10).—‘He shall have only as much as would sustain
his life, and should not care for the obtaining of vessels; he should
not be aggrieved when ho fails to obtain things, nor should he exult at
obtaining them.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (10-22).—‘He should not be dejected when he obtains nothing,
nor glad when he receives something. He should seek only as much as will
sustain life, without caring for property.’

*Viṣṇu* (96.4).—‘If he does not get alms, he must not be sorry.’
