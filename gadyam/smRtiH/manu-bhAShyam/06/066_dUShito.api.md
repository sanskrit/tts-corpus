Even though he be adorned, the man should fulfil his duty, to whichever order he may belong. He should be equal to all beings; mere external marks are not conducive to merit.—(66)

‘*Adorned*’—with flowers, bracelets and other ornaments.

‘*Duty*’—all that has been prescribed for the Renunciate, such as
meditation on the Self and so forth, he shall perform with care. In fact
one should perform the duties of that order to which he may belong.

One should not consider himself to have become a ‘Renunciate’ merely by
wearing such external marks as the ‘three staffs’ and the like; in fact
‘*he should be equal, to all beings*’;—that is, he should, with care,
eschew all love, hatred and greed.

By deprecating the external marks it is not meant that the man should
wear ornaments.—(66)

*Cf*. 3.50 and 12.102.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.65);—and in
*Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 35), which reads *bhūṣitaḥ*’ for ‘*dūṣitaḥ*’,
explains it as ‘*adorned* with the staff and other signs of the
Remmciate’ and says that the particle ‘*api*’ implies that even when
without these, he should meditate upon the identity of the individual
and supreme selves.

**(verses 6.66-67)  
**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (10.18).—‘He shall not wear any visible mark of his order,
nor adopt any visible rules of conduct.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.65).—‘The mere adoption of any particular order is not
a means of acquiring spiritual merit.’

066	To whatever order he may be attached, let him, though blemished (by a want of the external marks), fulfil his duty, equal-minded towards all creatures; (for) the external mark (of the order) is not the cause of (the acquisition of) merit.
