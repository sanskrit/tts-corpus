**कालपक्वैः** । पनसादीनाम् अग्निनापि पाकः क्रियते तन्निषेधार्थम् । तद् अग्निपक्वं गृहस्थस्यानिषिद्धम् । वैखानसं नाम शास्त्रम्, यत्र वानप्रस्थस्य धर्मा विहितास् तेषां मते स्थितः । अन्याम् अपि तच्छास्त्रोक्तां चर्यां शिक्षेत ॥ ६.२१ ॥

‘*Ripened in their own season*’.—The jack-fruit and some other fruits
are ripened (artificially) by means of fire also; and it is with a view
to exclude these that this epithet has been added. But fruits ripened by
means of fire are not forbidden for the Householder.

‘*Vaikhānasa*’ is the name of a treatise where the duties of the Hermit
are prescribed;—keeping firm on these rules;—*i.e*. he should seek to
learn also the other details of life prescribed in that treatise.—(21).

**The commentary and the mūla texts from 6.21–38 were illegible to Derrett. This is something that we may want to revisit by reading the original Malayalam manuscript. The readable commentary ends thus:

पुनर् ब्राह्मः एतस्माल् लिङ्गाद् अग्निपरित्यागात् । । । योत्सन्नशाखास्थम् अनुत्सन्नशाखास्थं वा चतुर्थम् आश्रमान्तरं प्रसादयितयं श्रुत्यविरोदेन्ह, यत् कारणं न ह्य् अकस्मात् सर्वकर्मसूत्रकर्तनो ऽस्ति ।
