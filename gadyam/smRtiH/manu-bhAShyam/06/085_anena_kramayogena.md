**क्रमेण योगो** ऽनुष्ठानम् । आत्मज्ञानकर्मणोः समुच्चये यः क्रम उक्तः, तेन ऋणापाकरणं कृत्वेत्य् अर्थः । **विधूय पाप्मानम्** अश्व इव रोमरजांसि, तथैवात्मविद्यया । यथोक्तम् "यथा पुष्करपलाश आपो न श्लिष्यन्त्य् एवम् एतद्विदि पापं कर्म न श्लिष्यति" (छु ४.१४.३) इति । **परं ब्रह्माधिगच्छति** । तद्रूपः संपद्यते निवृत्तभेदग्रह इति विद्याश्रमफलविधिः ॥ ६.८५ ॥

‘*Successive process*’—the adopting of the method that has been
described as consisting of the combination of action and
knowledge;—*i.e*., after having paid off his debts.

‘*Shakes off evil*’—just as the horse shakes off its hairs, so the nun
shakes off evil by means of self-knowledge. This has been thus
described—‘Just as the water does not become attached to the. lotus-leaf
so evil does not become attached to the man who knows It.’

‘*He attains the Supreme Brahman*’—becomes one with Brahman, having got
rid of all notions of diversity.

This verse describee the reward following from true knowledge and from
the proper fulfilment of the duties of the particular life-stage.—(85).
