If the phrase ‘*grains fit for hermits*’ is not connected with what has
gone before, then there is no room for the objection—“how can the
sacrificial offerings be made, which are laid down as to consist of
*Vrīhi* and other cultivated grains?”

The ‘boiled mess’ and ‘cake’ meant here are those that have been
prescribed by the rules laid down for Hermits.

‘*Vāsanta*’—those that grow, or ripen, during spring; similarly
‘*śārada*’.

^(‘)*Sacred*’—this is a mere re-iteration.

^(‘)*Which he has himself gathered*’.—This forbids such means of
livelihood as receiving gifts and the like. For the due fullilment of
the aforesaid s *mārta* rites, grains have to be gathered by wandering
hither and thither.

‘*According to law*’, ‘*severally*’.—Both these terms are added for
filling up the metre.—(11).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.46), which notes that even
though the ‘*munyanna*’ is by nature pure, yet the text has added the
epithet ‘*medhya*’ with a view to indicate that the grains should be
*fit for being offered at a sacrifice*;—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra,
p. 528), which explains ‘*munyanna*’ as ‘uncultivated grains,’ and
‘*medhya*’ as ‘fit for being offered at sacrifices.’

*Āpastamba* (2.22.17-18).—‘He shall offer the burnt oblations, sustain
his life... Rice must be used for those sacrifices for which cakes mixed
with meat are offered by the Householder.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.48).—‘The rites prescribed in the Smṛti and in the
Śruti, as also all acts, he shall perform with oils extracted from
fruits.’
