‘*One living on food cooked by fire*’.—One whose food consists of
vegetables and rice &c. cooked by fire.

Or he may rat only such fruits of trees as ripen themselves in their
season.

Or his food may consist of flour obtained by grinding *nīvāra* and other
grains. That is, he should grind these grains, and having thus turned
them into dough, eat. it.

Or this phrase may mean that those nuts that ripen in their own season,
and which have a kernel beneath a hard crust,—the outer crust of these
should be broken with stone and the inner kernel eaten.

‘*Dantolūkhalikaḥ*’.—One who has his teeth for the mortar. That is the
outer crust of nuts may be removed with the teeth. This however ought
not to be done even though the nut may have been cleaned.

Or the phrase may be taken as qualifying the eating; the sense being
that—‘he shall eat in such a way that his teeth may serve the purposes
of the mortar, in the thumping and removing of chaff’.—(17).

*Bodhāyana* (3.3.1-3, 9-12),—‘Hermits belong to two classes—those who
cook, and those who do not cook, food;—those who cook are of five
kinds—those who eat everything that the forest contains, those who live
on unhusked grain, those who eat bulbs and roots, those who eat fruits
and those who eat pot-herbs. Those who do not cook are of five
kinds—those who avoid the use of iron and other implements, those who
ṭake food with the band, those who take it with the mouth, those who
subsist on water only, and those who live on air only.’

*Viṣṇu* (95, 14, 15).—‘He shall break his food with stones; or he shall
use his teeth as a pestle.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3, 49).—‘He shall use his teeth as the pestle; or he may
eat only such fruits as ripen in their own time; or he may use stone for
breaking what he eats.’
