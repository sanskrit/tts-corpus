<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

What is stated here is a mode of meditating upon the Supreme Truth,
consisting in the noting of the fact that birth and rebirth abound in
pain.

Finding that life in the world abounds in sufferings caused by the
separation from friends, relations, sons and wife and the loss of wealth
&c., how could the man voluntarily go on undergoing the physical
troubles of wandering about, begging for alms and so forth?

The ‘*conditions*’ of men abound in pain and result from the defects of
their actions,—from their doing what is forbidden; *e.g*., such acts as
doing injury to living beings, stealing, adultery, cruelty, back-biting,
improper intentions and so forth. Or ‘conditions’ may stand for what the
man undergoes in the world of the living itself,—in the shape of sorrows
resulting from poverty, disease, ill-treatment and so forth.

As regards the other world, there is ‘*falling into hell*’—*i.e*., being
born as worms and insects in places filled with urine, ordure and dirt
&c.

‘*Sufferings in the abode of the death-god*’—in the form of *Kumbhīpāka*
and other hells.

Something more has to be reflected upon (and this is pointed out in the
next verse).—(61)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 968), which explains
‘*Yamakṣaye*’ as ‘in Yama’s abode’;—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 34).

*Viṣṇu* (96.36, 38).—‘He shall reflect upon the anxieties arising in
youth from not obtaining the objects of pleasure, and upon the abode in
hells awarded as punishment for enjoying them after they have been
obtained unlawfully; and on the fearful agonies of hell.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.63, 64).—‘He should reflect upon residence in the womb,
as also the sufferings brought about by one’s own acts, mental agonies,
physical ailments and other troubles, decrepitude, bodily deformities,
birth and rebirth during thousands of lives, and vicissitudes of
pleasure and pain.’
