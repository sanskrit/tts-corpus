Of forest-grown things also, those ‘produced by ploughing’ are
forbidden; while things grown in villages, even though not ‘produced by
ploughing’, have been already forbidden by verse 3 above; the present
fresh prohibition is meant for flowers and fruits, and this prohibition
applies to the use of village-grown flowers and fruits in the
worshipping of gods &c.

‘*Even though he be in distress*’.—That is, even though nothing else be
available, and the worshipping of gods be absolutely necessary,—these
things shall not be used even as substitutes.

The term ‘*api*’, ‘*even*’, should be construed away from where it
occurs; the sense being—‘*even* f lowers shall not be used, what to say
of *grains*?’—(16).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (9.4),—‘He shall gather wild-growing roots and fruits only.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.46).—‘Wearing beard and braided hair, self-controlled,
he shall support, with grain obtained without ploughing, the fires, the
Pitṛs, gods, guests and dependants.’

*Laugākṣi* (Aparārka, p. 942).—‘Vrīhi, barley, wheat, sesamum, mustard,
sugar-cane and *Priyaṅgu*,—these are the village-grown substances.’
