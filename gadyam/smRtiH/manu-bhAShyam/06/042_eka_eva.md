He shall always wander about alone, without a companion, in order to attain success; when one realises that success accrues to the solitary man, he neither forsakes nor becomes forsaken.—(42)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse enjoins solitude.

‘*Alone*’—denotes the giving up of past acquaintances.

‘*Without a companion*’:—he shall not take with him even his former
servant &c. It is only in this way that the man becomes free from
friendship, hatred and love; and thus comes to look upon all things as
equal. Otherwise, if a servant happen to be near him, he could have the
notion that—‘this man is *mine*, not that’; and this is the attachment
that becomes the cause of bondage.

When he realises this, then he does not ‘*forsake*’—no son or anybody
else is ever forsaken, by him; and hence he himself also is not
‘*forsaken*’—*not* separated from this son and others; *i.e*., he is not
beset with the pain of separation from them. Otherwise—if there had been
attachment—the giving up would cause great pain. In fact, for auch a man
no one dies, nor does he die for any one.—(42).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 953), which explains ‘*siddhim na
jahāti*’ as ‘he is not abandoned by success’;—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 557), which adds the following explanation:—Coming to the
conclusion that when a man moves about alone, without a companion, he is
free from any such obstacles as attachment aversion and the like, and
thus becomes enabled to attain ‘success’ in the shape of True
Knowledge;—*i.e*., he acts without shackles towards its attainment; and
of that success lie is not deprived, *i.e*., he attains it. If, on the
other hand, he moves about with two or three companions, then he becomes
liable to attachment and aversion, and by reason of these obstacles, he
fails to attain that success.
