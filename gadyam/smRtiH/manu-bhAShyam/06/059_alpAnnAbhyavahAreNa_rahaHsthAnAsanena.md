**रहो** निर्जनो देशः, तत्र **स्थानासने** कर्तव्ये । एकारामतायाः फलम् इन्द्रियजयो ऽनेन प्रदर्श्यते । 

- <u>अथ वा</u> निष्कुतूहलतानेनोच्यते । यत्र बहवो जनसंघाताः स्त्रीपुंसात्मका विचित्राभरणा दृश्यन्ते न तत्र क्षणम् अपि तिष्ठेत् ॥ ६.५९ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*In solitude*’—in a place devoid of people—he shall stand and sit.

This indicates that ‘subjugation of the senses’ is the result of living
in solitude. Or, it may be taken to be indicative of *freedom from
curiosity*.

He shall not stay even for a moment at a place where large number of
people, men and women, with various kinds of dress and ornaments,
congregate.—(59)

has reached him accidentally; so much only as is sufficient to sustain
life They quote the following:—“Eight mouthfuls make the meal of a
Renunciate, etc., etc.”’
