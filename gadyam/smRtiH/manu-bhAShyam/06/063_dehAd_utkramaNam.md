There is for his Inner Soul departure from the body, then again birth in the womb, and transmigrations among millions of life-forms.—(63)

प्राणानाम् **उत्क्रमणम्** अन्तर्विच्छेदः । दुःसहा च सा पीडा । **गर्भे च संभवः** । तत्र नानाविधं दुखं इन्द्रियाणाम् अनुद्भेदात् तमोरूपता कुक्षिस्थस्य मातृसंबन्धिनाहारेण अतिशीतोष्णेन हीनातिमात्रेण वैद्योक्ता पीडा । **योनिकोटिसहस्रेषु सृतीः** सरणानि प्राप्तास् तिर्यक्प्रेतकृमिकीटपतङ्गश्वाद्याः क्षेत्रज्ञस्य ।

- <u>ननु</u> च विभुर् अन्तरात्मेष्यते नित्यश् च । तस्य सकलजगद्व्यापिनः कुत उत्क्रमणम्, क्व च योनिसरणम् । संभवोऽपरि गर्भे नित्यस्यानुपपन्नः ।

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

There is ‘*departure*’—going out—of the life-breaths; and this
constitutes unbearable pain.

‘*Birth in the womb*’— where there are several kinds of pain: the organs
are not *yet* developed, the child in the womb is in utter darkness, and
it also suffers from diseases, described in the medical science, as
proceeding from the extremely cold and hot foods eaten by the mother in
varying quantities.

‘*Transmigrations*’— passing through—‘*among millions of
life-forms*’;—the soul being born in the bodies of lower animals, worms,
insects, dogs and so forth.

*Objection*—“The Inner Soul is held to be omnipresent and eternal; how
can there be any ‘*departure*’ for it, when it is present everywhere?
how again can there be any ‘*transmigration*’ among life-forms? how too
can there be any ‘*birth*’ for it when it is eternal?”

*Our answer is as follows*:—The theory of some people is that there lies
within the body the ‘personality’ of the size of the thumb, composed of
rudimentary substances, mind and intellect; and it is this personality
that goes on being born during the entire series of births and deaths;
and when this becomes endowed with a certain merit, the faculty of
consciousness becomes manifested in it; and it is through this faculty
that the qualities of the said Personality come to be attributed to the
Inner Soul.

Or, the explanation may be that the inner soul is related to certain
entities in the shape of the life-breath and so forth; and when these
depart, the soul is said to ‘depart.’ Similarly with ‘birth.’

All this we shall explain again under Discourse XII and we need not
prolong the discussion here.—(63)
