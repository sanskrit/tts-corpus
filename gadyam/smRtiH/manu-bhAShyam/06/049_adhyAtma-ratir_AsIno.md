<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Spirituality*’— disposition to concentrate one’s attention upon the
quest for the true nature of the self;—‘*centered*’— always thinking of
it, he shall remain.

‘*Disintrested*;’—this re-iterates what has been already said before
regarding his not caring for the due fulfilment of *Dharma* and other
things.

‘*Nirāmiṣaḥ*’—free from longings. Flesh is ‘*āmiṣa*’, which indicates
(figuratively) *longing*, by reason of the fact that living beings have
a great liking for flesh; and this longing is forbidden.

All the rest has already been explained before.—(49).

*Mahābhārata* (12.330.30).—(Same as Manu, the last foot being read as
‘*yaścaret sa sukhī bhavet*.’)

*Āpastamba* (2.21.13).—‘Abandoning truth and falsehood, pleasure and
pain, the Vedas, this world and the next, he shall seek the Ātman.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (10.17, 20).—‘Freedom from future births is certain for him
who constantly dwells in the forest, who has subdued his organs of
sensation and action, who has renounced all sensual gratification, whose
mind is fixed in meditation on the Supreme Spirit, and who is
indifferent (to all things).’

049	Delighting in what refers to the Soul, sitting (in the postures prescribed by the Yoga), independent (of external help), entirely abstaining from sensual enjoyments, with himself for his only companion, he shall live in this world, desiring the bliss (of final liberation).
