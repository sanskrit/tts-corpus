The ‘*Aparājitā*’ is the name of the North-Easterly direction, known
among the people as ‘*Aiśānī*’;—‘*Having fixed upon*’ this direction—as
“this is the direction towards which I shall go’,—he should proceed
towards it.

‘*Moving straight on*’—not swerving from his path, not seeking to avoid
even rivers and streams. This is a rule laying down the going towards
the North-East.

‘*Intent*, *living upon water and air, till the falling off of the
body*.’—That is, until the body falls off, he shall live upon air and on
water.

‘*Intent*’,—having concentrated himself by the rules of Yoga.

This refers to the ‘Grand Journey’ (towards certain death).—(31).

‘*Yuktaḥ*’—‘Intent on the practice of yoga’ (Govindarāja and
Kullūka),—‘firmly resolved’ (Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānaṇda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 945), which adds the following
notes:—‘*yuktaḥ*’ means ‘*samāhitaḥ*’, ‘intent, calm, collected’; this
teaching regarding the ‘Great Journey’ is only by way of an illustration
for all such means of self-immolation as burning, drowning and the like.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.55);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
1660), which explains ‘*aparājitā*’ as ‘the north-easterly
direction,’—towards that he should go straight on, till his body falls,
living upon water and air and with mind duly concentrated and calm.
