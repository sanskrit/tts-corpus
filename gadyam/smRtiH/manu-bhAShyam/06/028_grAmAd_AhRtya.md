**ग्रास**ग्रहणान् न मूलफलभिक्षैव, ग्राम्यान्नाशनम् अन्यासाम्भवे ऽनेनानुज्ञातम् । गृहीत्वा **पुटेनैव पाणिना** भाजनरहितेन, **शकलेन** शरावाद्येकदेशखण्डेन ॥ ६.२८ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The use of the term ‘morsel’ implies that the alms are *not* to consist
of fruits and roots only. In fact the present text permits the use of
cultivated grains, in the absence of wild ones.

Receiving the alms either ‘*in the hollowed hand*’—without a dish—or in
a piece of broken earthenware, dish, &c.—(28).
