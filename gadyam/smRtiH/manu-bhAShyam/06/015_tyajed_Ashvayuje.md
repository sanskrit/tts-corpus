This throwing away of the food during the month of *Āśvina* is
applicable to cases where the man is either one who lays by provision
for six months or for one who does it for a year.

“As a rule hermits’ food should be collected only in such quantities as
may be actually needed for the rites to be performed; so that there can
be no surplus; under the circumstances, what would be there to be thrown
away?”

The answer to this is as follows At the time that the man is gathering
food he cannot always keep a weighing balance in his hand; hence it is
quite possible that some small quantities may be left over; and it is
these that have to be thrown away during the month of *Āśvina*.

‘*Worn out clothes*’.—There is no throwing away of such clothes as are
not worn out.—(15).
