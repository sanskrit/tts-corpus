**वेदम् अभ्यसेति** वेदस्यात्यागम् आह । दर्शितम् एतत् । **अभ्यस्यन्न्** इति शतृप्रत्ययान्तपाठो वा । **पुत्रैश्वर्ये सुखं वसेत्** । पुत्रग्रहणम् उतपन्नस्य पुत्रस्य । अन्यो ऽपि यस् तत्स्थानः पौरादिस् तत्रापि युक्तो गृहान्तरन्यास इत्य् आहुः ॥ ६.९५ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Having studied the Veda*’;—this implies that the Veda shall not be
given up. This has been already explained above.

The right reading would appear to be the present-participial form
‘*abhyasyan*,’ ‘studying.’

‘*He shall live at ease under the protection of his son*’;—*i.e*., if he
has a son born to him; or of any other person who may be in the place of
his son; such, for instance as his grandson. They say that in this case
also one should retire to another house.—(95).

village,’
