पर्वसु यद् देवताभ्यो दत्तं तच्छिष्टम् एव भक्षयेन् न शाकमूलफलादि । **शेषम् आत्मनि युञ्जीत** आत्मनिमित्तम् उपयोजयेत्, आत्मार्थं शरीरस्थित्यर्थम् इत्य् अर्थः । **स्वयं कृतं च लवणं** न[^३] सैन्धवादि निषेवेत ॥ ६.१२ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

He should eat only what remains after the offerings to the gods have
been made on the New and Full moon days,—and not any herbs, roots,
fruits and the rest.—‘*He shall take to himself the remnant*’ shall use
it for his own purposes, *i.e*., for the sustaining of his body.

He should eat only such salt as is ‘*prepared by himself*’ and not
rock-salt &c.—(12).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Lavaṇam svayam kṛtam*’—‘Collected from saltmarshes’
(Kullūka);—‘collected from salt or alkaline elements of trees and the
like’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.46), which explains that the
salt is to be collected from salt-marshes.
