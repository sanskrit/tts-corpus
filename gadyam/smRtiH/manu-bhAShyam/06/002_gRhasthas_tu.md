It has been said before that the person who is entitled to the life of
the Hermit is only one who has abandoned all longing for the objects of
sense: and this is what the author is explaining now.

‘*Wrinkles*’—Looseness of skin.

‘*Greyness*’—the whiteness of the hair.

‘*Child’s child*.’—They explain this to mean ‘son’s son And cultured
people have held that this rule does not apply if the man has only a son
born to his daughter, or a daughter born to his son.

Others however have taken the ‘greyness of hair’ and ‘birth of the
grandchild’ only as indicative of *old age. So* that even if an old
man’s hairs may not, for some reason, become grey, he should, at the
approach of old age, retire to the forest. Just as the person who has
got a son and has his hairs still block is entitled to the ‘kindling of
fire so is the man who has got a grandson and has his head turned grey
entitled to the Hermit’s life. And in the former case also ‘the birth of
the son’ end ‘blackness of hair’ are only indicative of a certain age.

Some people have taken the text to mean that ‘*one* should retire into
the forest *neither too early nor too late in life*.’ But in is
necessary to find out an authority for this.—(2).

“Medhātithi notes that the Śiṣṭas insist on the necessity that he who
takes to forest-life must have sons and son’s sons, and that hence
‘*apatya*’, ‘offspring,’ is to be taken in this restricted sense (of
*grandson*, not *grand-daughter*);—Nārāyaṇa holds that the verse gives
three separate grounds for entering the third order, each of which is
sufficient in itself; while Medhātithi thinks that the three conditions
must exist together—\[There is nothing in Medhātithi to indicate this\].
‘Others,’ mentioned by Medhātithi, took the verse to give a description
of the approach of old age, which entitles the house-holder to turn
hermit”—Buhler.

Medhātithi mentions,—but with disapproval—another explanation, by which
the whole verse serves only to indicate that one should take to the
hermit’s life neither ‘too early’ nor ‘too late.’

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* to the effect that one should retire
to the forest either when he has become decrepit with old age, or has
got a grandson in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 527);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 131);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 68b).
