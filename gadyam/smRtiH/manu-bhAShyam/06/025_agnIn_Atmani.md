‘*Vaitāna*’—*Śrauta*.

These fires he shall reposit within himself, by swallowing their ashes
and perfoming such other rites as have been laid down in connection with
it. The exact procedure of this *repositting* should be learnt from the
*Śravanaka* (?).

When austerities have been performed for a long time, and the man has
reached seventy years of age, then, still remaining a hermit, he shall
be ‘*without fires and without a house*’; *i.e*., he shall give up his
thatched dwelling-house.

“Where then should be live?”

He shall dwell ‘*at the roots of trees*’,—as is going to be said in the
next verse.

‘*He shall be a silent hermit’.—The* construction is ‘*muniḥ* *syāt*’,
‘he shall be a *muni*’; which means that he shall keep his speech under
control; the man who has his speech under control is called ‘a keeper of
the vow of silence’.

‘*Living upon roots and fruits*’.— This serves to exclude all other
kinds of food; he shall not eat even *Nīvarā* and the other wild
grains.—(25).

‘*Yathāvidhi*’—‘By swallowing the ashes and so forth’ (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘by repeating the vedic text, Taittirīya
Saṃhitā 2.5.8.8’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 944), which explains ‘*niketa*’
as ‘home’,—‘*muni*’ as ‘observing silence,’—and adds that alms should be
begged only in the event of his being unable to obtain wild fruits and
roots,—as is clear from what follows in verse 27 below.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.54), which explains ‘*muniḥ*’ as
‘observing the vow of silence’; and adds that in the event of his being
unable to get roots and fruits, he may beg from the houses of other
hermits, just enough to keep himself alive.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 531).

*Āpastamba* (2.21.21).—‘He shall keep only one fire, have no house,
enjoy no pleasures, have no protector, observe silence, uttering speech
only on the occasion of the daily recitation of the Veda.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (9.11.12).—‘After six months, he shall live at the root of a

Pitṛs and men will attain endless heaven.’

under a tree, eating measuredly, he shall beg alms only from the houses
