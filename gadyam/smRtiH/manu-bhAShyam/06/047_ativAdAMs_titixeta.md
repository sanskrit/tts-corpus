शास्त्रम् अतिक्रम्य यः कश्चिद् वदति सो **ऽतिवादः** अप्रियाक्रोशः । **तितिक्षेत** क्षमेत, न प्रत्याक्रोशेत् । न च मनसा क्रुध्येतेत्य् अतो वक्ष्यति "आक्रुष्टः कुशलं वदेत्" (म्ध् ६.४८) इति । अनेन मनसः क्षोभो विनिवार्यते, न कुशलशब्दाभिधानं विधीयते । तदा हि मिथ्यावादी स्याद् अन्यद् धृदये ऽन्यत् तु वाचा वदन् । **नावमन्येतेति** । अवज्ञानं न कस्यचित् कुर्यात् । गुर्वादिपूजनं नातिक्रामेत् । **न चेमं देहम्,** यदि कश्चित् प्रहरेच् छरीरे, तेन सह वैरं कुर्यात् । "किम् अनेन मे शरीरेण नष्टेनानष्टेन वा, तेजोमयं मे शरीरं भवतु" इति ध्यायेत् ॥ ६.४७ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When one speaks in a manner contrary to the scriptures, his words are
called ‘*improper*’—*i.e*. hard, disagreeable taunts;—these he shall
‘*bear patiently*’—*i.e*. tolerate, not answer back. In fact, he shall
not bear ill-will even in his mind; what is implied by the direction is
that ‘on being cursed he shall pronounce a blessing,” which forbids even
mental perturbation; and it does not mean that he shall actually ask the
man—‘is it well with you?’ Because if he spoke thus (and bore anger in
his mind) he would be a liar, saying one thing and thinking of another.

‘*He* *shall* *not* *insult*’—shall not show disrespect towards—any one.
That is, he shall not omit to show respect to his elders.

‘*For the sake of his present body*;’—*i.e*. if some one were to strike
his body—‘he shall not make enmity with him.’ He is to think all the
time in the following strain—? what would it matter whether this body
perished or not, I may have an effulgent body.’—(47).

one in his mind, nor bless the other.’
