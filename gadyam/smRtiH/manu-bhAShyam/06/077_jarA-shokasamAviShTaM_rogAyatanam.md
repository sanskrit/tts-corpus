**(verse 6.76)**

This is meant to create disgust.

To say nothing of the bodies of worms insects and fleas, which are born
in the earth and out of moisture etc.,—the human body itself, which has
been considered highly desirable, the likelihood of losing which keeps
man in constant fear,—is like a latrine, the abode of urine and ordure.
It is this latrine-hut that is described.

The *bones* constitute the pillars; the hut is supported by the
bones;—it is tied up with the tendons; it is plastered outside with
flesh and blood;—and it is covered up with the *skin*; or *roofed over*
with the skin;—‘*filled with urine and ordure*’;—the use of the Genitive
here is analogous to that in the expression ‘*odanasya pūrṇaḥ*’, filled
with rice.—(76).

**(verse 6.77)**

^(‘)*Wrinkles*’—indicates a peculiar state of the body in old age, due
to its decrepitude.

‘*Harassed*’—ever beset with diseases.

‘*Sullied with passions*’—*i.e*., harbouring desires, the non-fulfilment
of which brings irremediable unbearable pain.

Realising all this the man ‘*shall discard*’ this body, which is the
abode of ‘*material substances*’—the products of the Earth, in the form
of fat, marrow, phlegm, urine, semen and blood;—it cannot be the abode
of the *Soul*; because this is all-pervading. For all these reasons one
should not cherish any affection for the body.—(77.)

**(verses 6.76-77)  
**

*Mahāhhārata* (12.330.42.43).—(Same as Manu.)

*Maitryupaniṣad* (3.4)—Do.

*Viṣṇu* (96.43-55).—‘He must recognise this human frame to consist of
seven elements;—those elements are adeps, blood, flesh, flesh-serum,
bone, marrow and semen. It is covered with skin; and it has a nasty
smell; it is the receptacle of impure substances. Though surrounded by a
hundred pleasures, it is subject to change; though carefully supported,
it is subject to destruction. It is the stay of carnal desire, wrath,
greed, folly, pride and selfishness. It consists of earth, water, fire,
air and *ākāśa*. It is provided with bone, tubular vessels, arteries and
sinews. It is endowed with the quality of *Rajas*. It is covered with
six skin-layers; it is kept together by three hundred and sixty hones.’

*Kāmandaka* (3.10).—‘This clayey tenement rendered agreeable by
artificial means is evanescent like a shadow and vanishes even as a
bubble of water.’

077	Let him quit this dwelling, composed of the five elements, where the bones are the beams, which is held together by tendons (instead of cords), where the flesh and the blood are the mortar, which is thatched with the skin, which is foul-smelling, filled with urine and ordure, infested by old age and sorrow, the seat of disease, harassed by pain, gloomy with passion, and perishable.
