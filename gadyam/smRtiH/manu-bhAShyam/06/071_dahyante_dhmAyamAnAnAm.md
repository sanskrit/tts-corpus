Just as the impurities of metallic ores are consumed when they are blasted, even so are the taints of the senses consumed through the suspension of breath.—(71)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When the ‘metallic ores,’ of gold for instance, are blasted in a
furnace, what is left behind is pure gold; similarly when the senses
apprehend their objects, the man feels joys and sorrows, and these are
productive of sin; this sin is consumed through the suspension of
breath.

For the man seeking Liberation, indulging in joys and griefs has been
forbidden.

But even in a man who has given up all attachment, and has his organs
under his control, these are bound to appear, in howsoever small a
degree, through the sheer nature of things, whenever by chance various
kinds of colour, sound &c. become presented before him. And it is for
the removal of the taints due to these that breath-suspensions have to
be practised.—(71)

*Vaśiṣṭha* (25.6).—‘Through the inhibition of breath air is generated;
through air is produced fire; then through heat water is formed; hence
one becomes internally purified by these three.’

*Baudhāyana* (4.1.24).—(Same as above from Vaśiṣṭha.)

071	For as the impurities of metallic ores, melted in the blast (of a furnace), are consumed, even so the taints of the organs are destroyed through the suppression of the breath.
