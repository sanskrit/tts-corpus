From this time onward he shall not eat any food consisting of barley,
paddy and the like;—this is what is meant by ‘*hav* - *ing given up*’.
This is what has been described as ‘living on roots.’

‘*Belonging*’—Consisting of cows, houses, clothing, seats and beds, etc.

If the wife wishes it, then they should go away together; Otherwise he
shall go alone. Others explain the text to mean that if the wife is
still young he shall commit her to his sons, and if she is old, he is to
take her with himself.

It is only when the wife is there that there can be any rule regarding
her either being made over to the sons or going to the forest with her
husband. If the wife has died, then also the man should retire to the
forest, as declared by Āpastamba and others, in connection with the
‘Re-kindling of Fire.’

Only that man can be a Hermit whose senses are not too mobile;
otherwise, he should take another wife; such is the established
rule.—(3).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.46);—in *Parāśaramādhava*

uncultivated food;—in *Kālaviveka* (p. 427) to the effect that sexual
intercourse is possible for the Hermit also;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
132);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 68b).
