The renunciate shall go for begging alms at a time when there is no smoke issuing, when the pestle has ceased to ply, when fire embers have been extinguished, when people have eaten, and when the removal of the dishes has been finished.—(56)

भुक्तवन्तो जना यस्मिन् काले स **भुक्तवज्जनः** ।एवं **विधूमा**दयो ऽपि । **शरावाणां संपात** उच्छिष्टानां भूमौ त्यागः, स यदातीतो भवति । सर्वेणैतेन प्रथमे पाककाले भिक्षादानावसरो निवृत्तो यदा भवति, तदा भिक्षितव्यम् इत्य् आह । **विधूम** इत्यादिना द्वितीयपाकप्रवृत्तिम् आह । **सन्ना मुसला** अवघातान् निवृत्ताः स्थापिताः ॥ ६.५६ ॥

That time at which people have already eaten. Similarly with the other
epithets, ‘*Vidhūme*’ and the rest.

‘*Removal of the dishes*,’—the throwing away of the dishes in which
people have taken their food; when this has been finished.

From all this what follows is that he shall beg for food after the first
occasion for the giving of alms, during the first instalment of the
cooking, has passed away.

‘*When there ie no smoke*’ etc., indicate the impossibility of the
cooking being done again.

When the pestles have ‘*ceased to ply*’—*i.e*., kept aside.—(56)
