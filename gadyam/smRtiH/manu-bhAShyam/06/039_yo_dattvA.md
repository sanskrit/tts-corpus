He who goes forth from home after having granted freedom from all fear to all beings,—to that expounder of the Veda belong regions of light.—(39).

गार्हस्थ्यनिन्दया चतुर्थाश्रमप्रशंसा । यज्ञे हि पशवो हन्यन्ते । "प्ररोहधर्मकाश् चेतनाः" इति दर्शने तृणौषधीनां छेद इत्य् एतद् भूतभयम् । तद् गृहात् प्रव्रजितस्य समारोपिताग्नेर् नास्तीत्य् उक्तम् । **अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यो दत्वेति** । अनेनाशुष्काणां तृणपलाशानाम् अनुपादानम् आह । **तेजोमया** नित्यप्रकाशा । उदयास्तमयौ यत्रादित्यस्य न विभाव्येते । यथोक्तम् "अत ऊर्ध्वम् आदित्यो नैवोदेति न वास्तम् एति" इत्य् उपनिषत्स्व् इत्य् एवम् आहुर् वचांसि ॥ ६.३९ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse eulogises the fourth life-stage at the expense of the
Householding stage.

At sacrifices animals are killed; the cutting of herbs and grasses also
constitutes ‘killing’, according to the theory that ‘all that grows is
animate’. It is this that constitutes the ‘fear’ of living beings. So
that when one has gone away from home, and has disposed of the Fires,
there is no such fear from him. This is what is meant by the
words—‘*having granted freedom from fear to all beings*.’ This also
indicates that the Renunciate shall not pick up for his use any inch
leaves or twigs as have not quite dried up.

‘*Of light*’—ever effulgent; where the rising and s etting of the sun
are not perceived; this is what is described by the words of the
Upaniṣads—^(‘)Beyond this the sun does not rise or set’—(39).

This verse is quoted in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 20), which explains
‘*brahmavedinaḥ*’ (which is its reading for ‘*brahmavādinaḥ*’) as
‘knowing the Brahman with properties’, which is clear from its being
mentioned along with ‘effulgent regions’ which could have no connection
with one who knows the absolute Brahman.

It is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 460).

**(verses 6.39-40)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (12.244.28; and 278.22).—(Reproduces Manu, the last foot
being read as *pretya cānantyamaśnute*; under 279, 2, the same foot is
read as ‘*tathānantyāya kalpate*.’)

*Baudhāyana* (2.17.29).—‘Finally he pours as much water as fills his
joined hands, saying “I promise not to injure any living being.” They
quote the following:—“A Renunciate who roams about after having given a
promise of safety to all living beings, is not threatened with danger by
any creature.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (10.1-3).—‘The Renunciate should depart from his house,
giving a promise of safety from injury to all living beings. They quote
the following:—“That Renunciate who wanders about at peace with all
creatures, forsooth, has nothing to fear from any living being; hut he
who becomes a Renunciate and does not promise safety from injury to all
beings, destroys the born and the unborn; and so does a Renunciate who
accepts presents.”’

039	Worlds, radiant in brilliancy, become (the portion) of him who recites (the texts regarding) Brahman and departs from his house (as an ascetic), after giving a promise of safety to all created beings.
