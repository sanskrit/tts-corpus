He shall heat himself with five fires; he shall kindle, four fires close
to himself on his four sides and shall expose himself to the sun at the
head.

During the rainy season, he shall have the sky for his sole shelter;
*i.e*., he shall live in a place where the rain falls, and he shall not
hold the umbrella or any such thing to ward off the rain.

‘*During the winter*’,—*i.e*., whenever it is cold; *i.e*., during the
two seasons of *Hemanta* and *Śiśira* (Winter and Midwinter)—he shall
have his clothes wet.

‘*Gradually*’— In due course.—(23).
