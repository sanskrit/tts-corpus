अधर्मात् प्रभव उत्पत्तिः । **दुःखेन** यो **योगः** पीडानुभवः । धर्म उक्तलक्षणो यः पदार्थः, ततः सुखेनाक्षयेन संयोगः । एतद् अप्य् अवेक्ष्यम् । पारिव्राज्यं च मुख्यो धर्म इत्य् अभिप्रायः ॥ ६.६४ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The ‘*infliction*’—experiencing—‘*of* *pain*’ proceeds from Demerit.

‘*Merit*’—as described above, is an ‘*artha*’, an ‘*entity*’ and from
this—entity, essence—proceeds ‘*union with imperishable happiness*’.

This also has to be reflected upon.

The meaning is that Renunciation constitutes the principal merit.—(64)

*Viṣṇu* (96.40-42).—‘He shall reflect thus that there is no pleasure to
bo met within this never-ceasing passage of the soul through mundane
existence; and that even what is called pleasure, on account of the
absence of pain, is of a transient nature; and that he who is unable to
enjoy such pleasures, from sickness and other causes, or who is unable
to procure them, suffers severe pangs.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.63.64).—(See under 61.)
