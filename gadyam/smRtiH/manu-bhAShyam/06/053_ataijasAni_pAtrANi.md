‘*Non-metallic*—His vessels for carrying food or water shall not be made
of gold or other metals.

‘*Free from holes*’— not having any holes etc.,

These are cleansed, like the sacrificial vessels, by means of water
alone; but only when they are not stained; if there are stained, these
should be removed by the use of other (cleaning) substances also. (53)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Ācāra, p. 567);—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 3.60), which remarks that the citing of the instance of
‘Cups at the sacrifice’ indicates that the vessels may be considered
*pure* for practical purposes;—in *Āparārka*, (p. 964);—in
*Madanapārijāta*, (p. 377);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasādā*, (Saṃskāra, p. 70b);—and
in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha*, (p. 78), which shows that the example of
‘*chamasa*’ indicates that the things are ‘clean’ only so far as to be
used.

wooden bowl, or in a vessel made of gourd; he should cleanse these
vessels with water.’
