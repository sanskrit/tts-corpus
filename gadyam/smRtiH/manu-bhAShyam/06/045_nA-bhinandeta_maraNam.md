<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This denotes freedom from troubles.

He shall not seek death; nor shall he seek life, for the purpose of
acquiring more knowledge.

‘*He shall await his time*’.—He shall cultivate the habit of thinking
‘let anything happen at any time it may’.

‘*Just as the servant waits for the fulfilness of his contract*’—‘This
work I have got to do for him during the day,—if I stop in the middle, I
shall not obtain full wages’.

Worldliness having thus ceased, when the man’s body falls off, he
attains Liberation, by this process and not by doing whatever he
likes.—(45)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 953), which explains ‘*nirveśam*’
as ‘time limit’—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 569);—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 70a).

045	Let him not desire to die, let him not desire to live; let him wait for (his appointed) time, as a servant (waits) for the payment of his wages.
