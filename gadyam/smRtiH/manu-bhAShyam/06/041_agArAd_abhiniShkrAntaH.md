‘*Sacred things*’—the muttering of sacred texts, kuśa-grass, water-pot
and deer-skin; —‘*Equipped*’— supplied—with these. Or ‘*pavitra*’ may be
taken as standing for the *purifying* penances.

^(‘)*Muni*’,—^(‘)*silenty*,’— speaking little.

‘*Presented*’—offered by some person;—‘*pleasures*’— pleasure-giving
objects, such as nice food and the like, which may come to him by
chance,—or the sounds of music &c.,—or sons end other relations. When
these happen to be presented before him, he should be^(‘)*indifferent*’
to them; *i.e*., he shall not look upon them for long with loving eyes,
shall not listen to them, or shall not sit with them.—(41).
