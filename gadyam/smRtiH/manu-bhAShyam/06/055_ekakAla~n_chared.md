He shall go for alms only once, and shall not seek for a large quantity; because the renunciate who becomes addicted to collecting alms becomes attached to sensual objects also.—(55)

भैक्षकार्यस्य भोजनस्यैककालता विधीयते, न पुनर् भैक्षचरणस्यैव । द्विर्भोजनप्रतिषेधो ऽत्राभिसंहितः । तत्र सकृच् चरित्वा द्वितीयस्मिन् काले शेषयित्वा न भुञ्जीत, तदर्थो भोजनप्रतिषेधः । अत एवाह **न प्रजज्जेत विस्तर** इति । द्वितीयभोजनार्थितया हि विस्तरः प्राप्नोति । एकारामस्य न भृत्यार्थेन भैक्षविस्तर इति । हेतुं ब्रुवन् सकृद्भोजने ऽपि सौहित्यं निषेधति ॥ ६.५५ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

What is laid down here is that the man shall *eat once*, this being the
purpose of the alms; it does not mean that he shall go to beg only once.
What is intended here is the prohibition of eating twice; that is, the
man, having gone for alms once, shall not save out of it for eating
again. It is with a view to this that we have the prohibition *of
eating*. It is for this reason that the text adds ‘*he shall not seek
for a large quantity*;’ *Seeking for a large quantity* can only be for
the purpose of eating again and again; specially because for one who
delights in solitude, large quantities of food would not be wanted for
the sake of servants and other dependents. By supplying a reason for
what is laid down, the text implies that even at a single meal the man
shall not eat too much.—(55)

सायं भोजनस्य प्रतिषेधः, गार्हस्थ्ये द्विभोजनस्य प्राप्तस्य ॥ ६.५५ ॥

055	Let him go to beg once (a day), let him not be eager to obtain a large quantity (of alms); for an ascetic who eagerly seeks alms, attaches himself also to sensual enjoyments.
