These ‘*restraints*’—observances and ‘*others*’—such as standing in
water, keeping the eyes closed and so forth.

^(‘)*Vedic texts contained in the Upaniṣads*.’—He shall study the texts
contained in the esoteric sections of the Veda, and think of them and
ponder over them;^(‘)*in order to attain the Self*’.

Or this may refer to the several forms of worship that have been laid
down for attaining Brahman.

‘*Several*’—this is a mere re-iteration.—(29).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 943), which explains ‘*dīkṣā*’ as
‘determination to keep the penances’;—and ‘*saṃsiddhi*’ as ‘well-defined
cognition’;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.51), which explains ‘*ātmasamsiddhi*’
as ‘the attaining of Brahman’;—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 531).
