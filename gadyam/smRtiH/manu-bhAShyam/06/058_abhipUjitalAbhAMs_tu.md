अभ्यर्च्य यं ददाति सो **ऽभिपूजितलाभः** । तं **जुगुप्सेतेति** निन्देद् गर्हेत । अतश् च निन्दितं न समाचरेत् । **सर्वशः** सर्वकालम् । एकम् अप्य् अहस् तादृशं भैक्षं न गृह्णीयात् । उत्तरे ऽर्थवादः । न हि मुक्तस्य बन्धसंभवः ॥ ६.५८ ॥

‘*Honorific presents*’—what is given after due honouring;—this he
shall^(‘)*disdain*’—deprecate, shun; and what is deprecated he shall not
do.

‘*All*’—at all times; not even for a single day he shall accept such an
aims.

The second half of the verse is a purely laudatory exaggeration; in
reality one who has been liberated can never be^(‘)*fettered*’
again.—(58).
