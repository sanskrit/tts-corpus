The author now mentions the “occupations” by name; and their mere names
imply the excellence of some of them; and from this it follows that one
should have recourse to the deprecated ones only when the commended ones
are not possible.

Of these, the “Death” and the “Super-Death” are the most deprecated; and
worse than these is the “Truth and Falsehood,” as is clear from the fact
that the Text says that one may live ‘*even* by these;’ where the term
‘*even*’ clearly indicates undesirability.—(4)

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (1.2.25.22).—‘The householder is of two kinds—the
*Sādhaka* and the *Non-sādhaka*; for the former, teaching, officiating
at sacrifices, receiving of gifts, gleaning and picking; for the
*Non-sādhaka* householder, gleaning and picking have been declared to be
the only two means of livelihood.’

004	He may subsist by Rita (truth), and Amrita (ambrosia), or by Mrita (death) and by Pramrita (what causes many deaths); or even by (the mode) called Satyanrita (a mixture of truth and falsehood), but never by Svavritti (a dog's mode of life).
