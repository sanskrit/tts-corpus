He shall not despise himself by reason of former failures. Until death, he should seek fortune, and he should never think her unattainable.—(137)

‘*Failure*’—non-acquisition of wealth, by agriculture and such other
means.

‘*He shall not despise himself*,’—regarding himself as ‘unfortunate,’ as
a ‘sinner, ‘I have not obtained wealth at this time, at what time shall
I obtain it?’—He shall not ponder, in this fashion, over his failure.

‘*Until death, he should seek fortune*;’—*i.e*., to his very last
breath, he should not renounce the desire for acquiring wealth.

‘*He should not reyard* *her* *as unattainable*.’—Having formed the
determination, ‘My attempt shall surely succeed,’ he shall not mind the
evil aspects of planets or other disheartening circumstances, and shall
proceed to take steps to earn wealth. In this connection, there is a
saying—‘It is only persons devoid of manly courage that seek to examine
the aspect of planets; there is nothing unattainable for such persons as
are endowed with courage and energy.’

What is meant by this is as follows:—He who broods in the following
manner—‘I am in a sorry plight, I can obtain wealth, with difficulty, I
am not entitled to the setting up of Fire and other rites, and therefore
I am freed from the necessity of undergoing the trouble of performing
the Agnihotra and other rites’—does not think rightly; consequently, one
shall always try to acquire wealth.—(137)
