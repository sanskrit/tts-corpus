<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Deserted house*’—*i.e*., one in which no one lives.

‘*His* *superior*.’—One who is inferior, in occupation (learning,
wealth, &c.), shall not address to his superior such words of advice as
‘this is proper for you,’ ‘that is improper,’ and so forth, accompanied
by a statement of reasons and arguments.

‘*Udakī*’—a woman in her courses;—with her he shall carry on no
conversation.

‘*He shall not go uninvited to a sacrifice*,’—*i.e*., to a place where a
sacrifice is being performed. Gautama has said—‘For merely seeing it, he
may go, if he desires’ (9-55); hence the present prohibition pertains to
such things as eating and the like at sacrifices, without
invitation.—(57).

This verse is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 71), which explains
‘*avṛtah*’ as ‘without invitation from the sacrificer’, he should not go
to a sacrifice, with the purpose of getting something; there is nothing
wrong in merely going to see the performance, as distinctly stated by
Gautama.
