If not on himself, then on his sons,—if not on his sons, then on his grandsons (falls the punishment); an unrighteousness, once committed, never fails to bring its consequences to the perpetrator.—(173)

<u>इदम् अयुक्तं</u> यद् अन्यकृतस्य कर्मणो ऽन्यगामिता फल्स्योच्यते । कर्तुः फलदानि वैदिकानि कर्माणि । न वैश्वानरन्यायो ऽस्ति, श्रवणाभावात् । न हि पुत्राद्यर्थतात्र श्रुता ।

- <u>सत्यम्</u> । पुत्रे पीड्यमाने पीडितस्य पितुर् अधिकतरं दुःखं भवति । अतः कर्तुर् एव दुःखम् । पुत्रस्यापि स्वकृतात् पौर्वदेहिकात् कर्मणस् तत्फलम् इत्य् अविरुद्धम् । एवं **नप्तृष्व्** अपि द्रष्टव्यम् । नप्तारः पौत्राः । **कृतो ऽधर्म** इति संहितायास् तुल्यत्वाद् धर्माधर्मौ द्वाव् अप्य् उपात्तौ ॥ ४.१७३ ॥

“It is not right that the consequences of acts done by one person should
be described as falling on others. As a matter of fact, all Vedic acts
bring their fruits to the person who performs them. The principle of the
*Vaiśvānara* sacrifice (whereby the fruits of the sacrifice accrue to
the son of the performer) cannot be held to be applicable to the present
case, as there is no direct assertion to that effect. In connection with
the acts dealt with in the present context, there is no assertion to the
effect that their consequences accrue to the performer’s son.”

True; but when the son suffers pain, it causes the father still greater
pain; so that, in that case also, the resultant suffering would fall
upon the perpetrator himsef (himself?). As regards the son also, the
said suffering may be said to come to him by virtue of some past misdeed
of his son; and there would be nothing incongruous in this.

The same holds good regarding ‘*grandsons*’ also.

‘*Kṛto-dharmaḥ*.’—Whether the component words be read as
‘*Kṛtaḥ-dharmaḥ*’ or ‘*Kṛtaḥ-adharmaḥ*,’ the resultant conjunct form
would be the same—‘*Kṛto-dharmaḥ*;’ hence both *dharma* (righteousness)
and *adharma* (unrighteousness) are meant to be spoken of (as not
failing in bringing up their consequences)—(173).

*Medhātithi* (P. 356, l. 20)—‘*Vaiśvānaranyāyaḥ*’—This refers to
*Mīmāṃsā-sūtra*, 4.38 *et. seq*, where it is stated that though the
*Vaiśvānara* sacrifice is performed by the Father, yet its results
accrue to the Son.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 68)—which adds
‘*Kṛtodharmaḥ*’ should be construed as ‘*Kṛtaḥ adharma*’, as the context
deals with *Adharma*,—‘*na* *niṣphalaḥ*,’ *i.e*., unless it is expiated.

173	If (the punishment falls) not on (the offender) himself, (it falls) on his sons, if not on the sons, (at least) on his grandsons; but an iniquity (once) committed, never fails to produce fruit to him who wrought it.
