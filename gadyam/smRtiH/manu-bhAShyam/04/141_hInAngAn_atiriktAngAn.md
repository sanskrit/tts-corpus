‘*Those who are deficient in limbs*;’—*e.g*., the one-eyed person, the
leper, the dwarf, and so forth.

‘*Those who have redundant limbs*;’—that is persons suffering from
elephantiasis and such diseases.

‘*Destitute of learning*’—Illiterate.

‘*Far advanced in age*’—*i.e*., very old persons.

‘*Destitute of beauty*;’—*i.e*., persons with a flat nose or with a
squint eye, and so forth.

‘*Destitute of wealth*’—poor; devoid of wealth, riches.

‘*Of low birth*’—persons whose birth is defective; *e.g*., the ‘*kuṇḍa*’
(one born of his mother’s paramour during his father’s life-time), the
‘*golaka*’ (one so born, after his father’s death), and so forth.

‘These *he shall not insult*.’— ‘Insulting’ means *despising*; the mere
act of calling these persons by these names would be an ‘insult.’—(141)

such words, though truthful are twice as bad as untruthful words.’
