यदर्थो ऽयं पुनर् विधिस् तद् दर्शयति । आयुरादिफलकामो दीर्घकालसंध्याजपं कुर्यात् । सत्य् अपि नित्यत्वे दैघ्याद् गुणात् फलम् इदम् । अनग्निकस्य प्रोषितस्यैतत् संभवति । अन्यस्य त्व् अग्निहोत्रकालोपरोधो दीर्घसंध्याविधिसंपादनात् । दीर्घसंध्या गुणत उच्यते । संध्यासहचरिते जपादिविधौ संध्याशब्दो वर्तते । दीर्घा संध्यैषाम् इति बहुव्रीहिः । **ऋषि**ग्रहणम् अर्थवादः ॥ ४.९४ ॥

The Author proceeds to show for what purpose the aforesaid act has been
prescribed. The meaning is that if one desires such rewards as long life
and so forth, he should perform the twilight-devotions for a long time.
Though the act is an obligatory one, yet the said rewards follow from
prolonging it.

This prolongation is possible only for one who is either without Fires,
or is away from home. As for others (*e.g*., the man with the Fires
living at home), the prolongation of the Twilight-Devotions would
inpinge upon the time laid down for the Agnihotra-offerings.

The twilight devotion is called ‘*prolonged*,’ only figuratively; the
term ‘twilight devotion’ standing for the reciting of Mantras, etc.,
that is done in connection with the said devotion.

The compound ‘*dīrghasandhyā*’ is a *Bahuvrīhi*.

The mention of the sages is by way of a commendatory statement—(94)

‘*dīrghasandhyatva*’ is secured by continuing the Japa till after
sunrise.
