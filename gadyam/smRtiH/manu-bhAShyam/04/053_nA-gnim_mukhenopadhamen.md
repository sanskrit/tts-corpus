Fire should be blown with deer-skin-fans and such things.

‘*He shall not look at a naked woman*’—‘apart from sexual intercourse,’
says another Smṛti-text.

‘*Unclean thing*’—‘*ameḍhya*—‘*medha*’ means- *sacrifice*; ‘*medhya*’ is
*fit for use at sacrifice*; and ‘*amedhya*’ is *unfit* for use at
sacrifices; such things, for instance, as onions, urine, excreta, and so
forth. Anything like this, he shall not throw into fire.

He shall not raise his feet directly towards the fire and warm them at
it. There is no objection to the feet being covered and then warmed for
the purpose of exciting perspiration.—(53).

*Gautama* (9.33).—‘Blowing fire with the mouth, wrangling, obtrusive
wearing of garlands and sandal-paste, eating with his wife, looking at

eating while seated on the chair, swimming in the river, climbing
trees,—these he shall avoid.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (15.20).—‘He shall not blow (the fire,
carelessly).’

Do. (30.20).—‘He shall not stretch his legs towards fire, water,
Brahmaṇas, Deities, wind.’

throw any unclean object into the fire,—he shall not warm his feet over
the fire.’

fire.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.135).—‘He shall not look at the sun, nor at the naked
woman, nor at the woman immediately after intercourse, nor at the urine
or at the stool, nor at unclean things, nor at the eclipse or at the
stars.’

*Yajñavalkya* (1.137).—‘He shall not throw into the water spittings or
