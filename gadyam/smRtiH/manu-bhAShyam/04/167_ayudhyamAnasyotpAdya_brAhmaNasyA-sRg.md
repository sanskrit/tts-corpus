<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Asṛk*’ is blood;—he who causes this to How from the body of the
Brāhmaṇa, by the stroke of the sword or such other weapons,—‘*even the
Brāhmaṇa is not fighting*—and not when he is actually taking part in
lawful battle, like Droṇācārya.

‘*Very great, suffering*’—in the form of hell.

‘*After death*,’—*i.e*., in another birth.

‘*Through folly*,’—This is a needless reiteration; the wise man, knowing
the scriptures, can never do such a thing.—(167).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 223);—and in *Mitākṣarā* (on
1.155), to the effect that no one should be struck who has given no
cause of offence.

**(verses 4.167-168)  
**

*Gautama* (21.22).—‘On fetching blood, for as many years as there may be
dust-particles wetted with the blood (he shall be unfit for heaven).’

*Baudhāyana* (1.1.6.8).—‘Having struck the Brāhmaṇa unintentionally, one
becomes defiled under the law; for this unintentional striking, the
sages have prescribed expiations; there is no expiation for intentional
striking. On threatening the Brāhmaṇa, one should perform the *Kṛcchra*;
on striking him, the *A* *tikṛcchra*; on spilling his blood, the
*Kṛccra* as well as the *Cāndrāyaṇa*.’

167	A man who in his folly caused blood to flow from the body of a Brahmana who does not attack him, will suffer after death exceedingly great pain.
