... *Answer*:—The term has been added for the purpose of laying stress
upon the fact that those persons are meant who still keep up their study
of the Veda.

‘*Householders*.’—This does not mean that the mendicant, the ascetic and
the student are not to be honoured; all that is meant is that, since all
these live upon *alms*, they cannot be regarded as ‘guests;’ especially
as the student cannot dwell anywhere else except at his teacher’s house,
and the ascetic cannot dwell away from the forests. For the Renunciate
also, dwelling in villages is not possible, since it has been distinctly
declared that ‘he shall go to the village only when seeking for alms’
(Gautama, 3. 14). From all this it follows that, in view of the fact
that persons in the other stages of life live in places other than
‘households,’—even though it be somehow possible for them to have the
character of ‘guests,’—what is said here can apply to *householders*
only, *as a rule*.

‘*With offerings to Gods, and to Pitṛs*.’—That is, these persons are to
be received and honoured at the performance of rites in honour of Gods
and of Pitṛs.

‘*Otherwise*.’—Those who are not ‘accomplished,’ should be avoided, even
though they be free from the aforesaid defects (described in 30).—(31)

*Laghuśātātapa* (78, 83).—‘If, in the matter of feeding and gifts, one
ignores a Brāhmaṇa Student who may happen to be at hand, he destroys his
family up to the seventh generation. If a Vedic Scholar, accomplished in
the Veda, in learning and in observances, come to one’s house, all the
vegetables become delighted at the prospect of reaching the highest
state.’

*Bṛhad-Yama* (42, 43).—‘The man who is free from jealousies, who is of
good character, a Vedic Scholar cognisant of Brahman, young and endowed
with learning and modesty is the proper recipient, the best of the
twice-born. He who is conversant with the Vedanta, who is Jyeṣṭhasāman,
free from avarice, devoted to the Veda, is the person who should be
employed with special effort in the rites offered to gods and Pitṛs.’
