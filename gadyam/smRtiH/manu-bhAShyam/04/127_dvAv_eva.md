The mention of ‘*always*’ here shows that the aforesaid occasions are to
be regarded as ‘unfit for study,’ only optionally; among these also
those that are obligatory have already been indicated; *e.g*., whenever
the term ‘always’ occurs; it has also been shown where what is stated is
purely descriptive; *e.g*., verse 114.

The place is regarded as ‘*unclean*’ when it is in contact with such
unclean things as bones, the generative organs, and so forth.

The conditions that make the man himself ‘unclean’ shall be described in
Discourse V.

Though the present conditions of ‘unfitness for study,’ are mentioned in
the context dealing with ‘Vedic Study,’ yet they are, in reality,
permanently ‘unfit for study;’ for the simple reason that the unclean
man is not entitled to any act; as says the Brāhmaṇa—‘For the sacrifice,
there are two conditions that make it *unjit*—when the man himself, or
the place, is unclean.’ The sacrifice here referred to is the
‘*Brahmayajña*,’ the daily reciting of Vedic mantras.—(127).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 193), which adds that this refers
to that ‘Vedic study’ which forms part of the daily ‘*Brahmayajña*’,
being based, as it is, on the following Taittirīya text: ‘*Tasya vā
etasya yajñasya dvāvanadhyāyau yadātmā*’ *śuciryoddeśaḥ*,’—which bears
specially upon the *Brahmayajña*;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 775), which
says that this refers to that Vedic study which forms part of the daily
*Brahmayajña*;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 164), which has the same
note;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 196).

127	Let a twice-born man always carefully interrupt the Veda-study on two (occasions, viz.) when the place where he recites is impure, and when he himself is unpurified.
