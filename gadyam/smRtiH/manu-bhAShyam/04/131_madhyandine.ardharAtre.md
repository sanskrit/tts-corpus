मध्याह्ने **ऽर्धरात्रे** महानिशायां समांसं च **श्राद्धं भुक्त्वा** **न सेवेत,** चिरं न तत्रासीत । यदि कथंचिद् ग्रामादि गच्छतो नान्तरेण चतुष्पथं मार्गान्तरम् अस्ति, तदा तावन्मात्रसंबन्धो न निषिध्यते । 

- <u>केचित्</u> तु चकारम् एवं योजयन्ति । श्राद्धं भुक्त्वा सामिषं चान्यद् अपि भोजनम् । <u>अस्मिंश्</u> च संबन्धे समाचारो ऽन्वेष्यः । नान्यथा व्यवहितः संबन्धो लभ्यते ॥ ४.१३१ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

At midday—at midnight—after having eaten, at a Śrāddha, food mixed with
meat—‘*he shall not have recourse to a cross-road*;’ *i.e*., shall not
stay there for any length of time. If, however, on his way; to another
village, there is no other way save through the cross-road, his having
recourse to it to that extent is not forbidden.

Some people add a further ‘*ca*,’ and explain the text to mean, ‘after
having eaten at a *śrāddha, and* after having partaken of meat-food.’

Under this explanation, however, it would be necessary to seek for some
usage in support of this; as without some such corroborative usage,
there can be no justification for such disjointed construction.—(131)
