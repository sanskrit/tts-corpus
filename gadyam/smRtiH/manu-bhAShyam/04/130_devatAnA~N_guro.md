‘*Gods*’ here stands for *Images*; as these alone can cast shadows.

‘*Superior*’—*i.e*., his father.

‘*Preceptor*’—one who has performed for him the Initiatory Ceremony.

These two have been mentioned separately, with a view to show that this
additional respect is to be shown to the two persons concerned, not
simply because they are to be treated as ‘superiors,’ \[but because they
are, by their distinctive character, entitled to this additional form of
respect\].

Hence, what is here prescribed does not apply to the maternal uncle and
such other persons.

Some people assert that “such a view would be contrary to usage; hence
the separate mention of the two (‘superior’ and ‘preceptor’) has to be
explained as anologous to such expressions as ‘(*gobalīvarda*,’ ‘bovine
bull’ (where the tautology indicates some sort of distinctive
superiority).

‘*Tawny*’ is the reddish brown colour; it stands here for a substance
possessed of that colour; in the present context it stands for either
the *tawny cow* or the *Soma-creeper*; the term ‘*babhru*’ (‘tawny’)
being found in the Veda to be applied to both these things.

‘*intentionally*.’—This means that if it is done unintentionally, there
is no wrong done.—(130)

‘*Babhruṇaḥ*’—‘Either the tawny cow or the Soma-creeper’
(Medhātithi);—‘the tawny’ (Kullūka);—‘tawny cow’ (Nandana);—‘a brown
creature’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 193), which explains ‘*babhru*’
as ‘a tawny animal, such as the cow and the like’;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on
1.152), which explains ‘*babhru*’ as ‘the cow or any other animal which
is of the colour of the mongoose’ or ‘the Soma and other such
creepers’;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 120), which explains ‘*babhru*’
simply as ‘*kapila*’, ‘tawny’;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 523);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 575), which also explains ‘*babhru*’
simply as ‘*kapilaḥ*’;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 88a);—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 321), which explains ‘*babhru*’ as ‘of the colour
of the mongoose.’

*Viṣṇu* (63.40).—‘He shall not step over the shadow of the god, the
Brāhmaṇa, the teacher, the tawny cow and the initiated person.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.152).—‘He shall not step over the shadow of a deity, a
priest, an accomplished student, the teacher, the king, and another
man’s wife;—nor over urine, excreta or spittings or vomits.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 193).—‘He shall not intentionally step over the
shadow of a deity, the twice-born, the teacher, the wise man, the
accomplished student, the preceptor and the minister; also of the tawny
cow;—nor should he allow his own shadow to be stepped over by a eunuch
or an outcast or a Caṇḍāla, or his enemies, or by a diseased person.’
