This is another method prescribed for the Householder.

Debts to the Great Sages are paid by Vedic Study; those to the *Pitṛs*
are paid by the begetting of children; and those to the Gods are paid by
sacrifices. This is what has been described in the passage—‘The Brāhmaṇa
is under three kinds of debts.’

‘*Gatvā*’—having brought, about the three forms of freedom from debt.

‘*He shall consign*’—make over—‘*everything*’—the entire business of the
house and family—‘*to his son*’—who has attained the age of business.

He shall remain in the house ‘*fixed in neutrality*’—*i.e*., having
resigned all egoism. That is, ‘he shall continue to dwell in the house,
having relinquished all such notions as *this is my wealth, these my son
and wife, these my male and female slaves.‘Neutrality*’ consists in the
feeling, ‘I do not belong to any one, no one belongs to me,’ in which
all desire is abandoned.

What is meant is the^(‘)renunciation’ of only ordinary voluntary acts
done for some purpose, and not of all (even obligatory) acts; as we
shall show later on.—(257)

257	When he has paid, according to the law, his debts to the great sages, to the manes, and to the gods, let him make over everything to his son and dwell (in his house), not caring for any worldly concerns.
