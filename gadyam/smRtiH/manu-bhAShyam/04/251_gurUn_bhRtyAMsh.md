‘*Teachers*;’—the plural form is used, in view of some persons teaching
directly, and others only indirectly, by implication.

‘*Dependents*,’—those who have a right to be maintained by him; these
are enumerated in another *Smṛti* text as follows:—‘Aged parents, the
well-conducted wife and the infant child.’

‘*For the purpose of bringing relief to these*’—when they are suffering
from hunger;—‘*and for the purpose of honouring the gods and guests*;—
that is, for the sake of due accomplishment of his daily duties.

‘*He may accept gifts from all persons*’—good or bad.

‘*But he shall not derive from them satisfaction for
himself*.’—‘*Satisfaction*’ here stands for *relieving hunger* and other
forms of enjoyment; these he shall not do. That is, such gifts shall be
accepted only for the sake of Teachers and others, and never for his own
sake.—(251)

“How, then, is the man to maintain himself?” In answer to this, we have
the following:—

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.10).—(Same as Manu, with slight variants.)

‘*devatātithīn*.’)

*Gautama* (17.4).—‘For the maintaining of the father, the Gods, the
Teacher and the dependants,—it is ditferent.’

*Āpastamba* (1.7.21).—‘Some people hold that for the sake of the teacher
the acceptance of gifts even from Śūdras and Ugras is sanctioned by the
scriptures.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.216).—‘For the worshipping of gods and guests, and for
the sake of one’s teacher and dependants, and for one’s own livelihood,
one may accept gifts from all.’

*Aṅgiras* (Aparārka, p. 408).—‘For the teacher, for guests and for
dependants one may accept food from the Śūdra; but he himself shall not
partake of it.’
