This sums up the contents of the whole Discourse:—

“*Thus has been described the eternal course of life of the
Householder*,”—the ‘non-eternal’ one being that which shall be described
in connection with abnormal times.

The addition of the term, ‘*Brāhmaṇa*,’ indicates that the observances
laid down are for the Brāhmaṇa Accomplished Student.

‘*Goodness*’—is a quality of the soul; and it is conducive to the
increase of this quality.

‘*Praiseworthy*’—excellent. All this is mere praise.—(259)

259	Thus have been declared the means by which a Brahmana householder must always subsist, and the summary of the ordinances for a Snataka, which cause an increase of holiness and are praiseworthy.
