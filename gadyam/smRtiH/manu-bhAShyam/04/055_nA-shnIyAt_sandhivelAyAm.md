At junction-time, he shall not eat, nor travel, nor sleep. He shall not scratch the ground; and he shall not remove his own garland.—(55).

संध्याकालः **संधिवेला** । संवेशनं स्वापः । स्वाध्यायं निषेत्स्यति । स्मृत्यन्तरे-

- चत्वार्य् एव तु कर्माणि संध्याकाले तु वर्जयेत् । 

- आहारं मैथुनं निद्रां तथा संपाठम् एव च ॥

**न चैव प्रलिखेत्** । प्रकर्षेण लेखनं विदारणं भूमेर् निषिध्यते । न तु वर्तिकादिनाक्षरविन्यासः । **नात्मनोपहरेत् स्रजम्** । ग्रथितानि पुष्पाणि स्रक् । ताम् स्वयं कण्ठे शिरसि वा प्रधृता म्लानतया गुरुत्वेन वात्मनो न व्यपनयेत् । अर्थाद् अन्येनापनयेद् इत्य् उक्तं भवति । सर्व एवायं संध्यायां विधिर् इति <u>केचित्</u> ॥ ४.५५ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Junction-time*’—twilight.

‘*Saṃveśana*’—is *sleeping*.

Vedic Study also during twilight is going to be forbidden later on.
Another Smṛti has forbidden intercourse with women also, during
twilight, *e.g*.—‘At the time of twilight, one shall avoid four
acts—eating, sexual intercourse, sleeping and reading.’

‘*He shall not scratch the ground*.’—What is forbidden is the tearing of
the ground, and not the writing of letters, &c., with a writing-brush
and such things.

‘*He shall not remove his own garland*.’—Flowers stringed together are
called ‘garland;’ and when one has placed this upon his head, or on his
neck, he himself should not remove it,—either because it has faded or
because it is found to be too burdensome. What is meant is that he shall
have it removed by another person.

Some people assert that the whole of the verse pertains to the time of
twilight.—(55).
