‘*Altercation*’—a quarrel, with mutual recrimination.

‘*Fight*’—in which the parties concerned strike each other with sticks
and such other weapons.

‘*Army*’—consisting of Elephants, Horses and Infantry.

‘*Battle*’—the actual affray.

Study is forbidden for one in the midst of an army, even though it be
not actually engaged in battle.

‘*When he has just eaten*;’—*i.e*, ‘so long as his hands are still
wet’—as mentioned in another Smṛti-text.

‘*Indigestion*;’—what has been eaten on the previous day, if it still
remains in the stomach, is called ‘undigested.’

‘*Vomiting*’—is well known.

‘*Eructation* even when there is no indigestion, if there is
‘eructation,’ that same day, or the next day.—(121).

‘*Vivāde-kalahe*’—‘Verbal altercation—actual fight’ (Medhātithi and
Kullūka);—‘dispute on legal matters—altercation’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 535);—in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 194);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 162), which
explains ‘*bhuktamātre*’ as ‘so long as one’s hands are wet’;—in
*Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 773), which has the same explanation;—in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 772),—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 56),
which explains ‘*muktake*’ (which is its reading for ‘*śuktake*’, or
‘*sūtake*’) as ‘*mukhodgāre*’, ‘where there is eructation, or belching.’
