‘*These*’—*i.e*., those going to be described;—‘he shall avoid who is
reading the Veda, as also the person who does the teaching.’ Inasmuch as
the work of *teaching* is mentioned, the reading of the Veda for the
purpose of repeating and getting up (the old lessons) is permitted (on
the days specified).

‘*Always*;’—*i.e*., not only after the performance of the
‘*Utsarga*’-rite, but also during the four months and a half, following
the ‘*Upākarma*’ rite.

‘*Of pupils*’— this is only an explanatory reiteration.—(101)
