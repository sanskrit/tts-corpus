<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

What is said here has already been said before; it is reiterated here
for the purpose of laying down the additional details that follow.

‘*No guest shall dwell in his house unhonoured*.’—That is, all guests
should be lodged in the house after being honoured.

‘*To the best of his ability*.’— One or two, or several,—as many as can
he duly honoured—shall be honoured with seat and other things. What is
meant is that when guests are living in one’s house, all these things
should be provided for them, in a respectful manner; it does not mean
that one should give away one’s proprietary right over all these
articles in.the house. Since ‘fruits and roots’ have been mentioned
separately, it follows that these are to be given only in the event of
other kinds of food, in the shape of rice, juice, meat and butter, being
not available.—(29)

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.21.1).—‘In the absence of all else, a place,
water, agreeable speech,—at least these should not fail towards one who
resides in his house; one should eat what has been left by the guests;
no such sweet dishes should one eat in his house as have not been
partaken of by the guest.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.26-27).—‘Though breathing, he does not live who makes no
offerings to gods, guests, dependents, Pitṛs and his own self. The
Religious Student, the Renunciate and the Hermit derive their sustenance
from the Householder; hence when these happen to arrive at one’s house,
he shall not disregard them.’

Do. (67.30, 40, 42, 43).—‘One shall not permit a guest to live in the
house without feeding him. The foolish man who eats food without
offering it to these knows not that he is himself being devoured by dogs
and vultures. After that the husband and wife shall eat what remains.
The Householder shall eat what is left after offerings have been made to
gods, Pitṛs, men, dependents and the household-deities. The food
prescribed for the good consists in the remnant of the sacrificial
offering.’

Do. (67.32-33).—‘Never without having given; never without pouring the
oblation into fire.’

*Mahābhārata* (12.249.5, 7, 12, 13).—‘One shall not have food cooked for
himself alone; one shall not needlessly kill animals;—no Brāhmaṇa should
reside in his house, without being honoured and fed. He shall always
feed upon *Vighasa* and upon *Amṛta—Amṛta* being the remnant of
sacrifices; and the eating of it is like the eating of sacrificial food.
He who eats what has been left after all dependents have been fed is
said to *feed on Vighasa*.’
