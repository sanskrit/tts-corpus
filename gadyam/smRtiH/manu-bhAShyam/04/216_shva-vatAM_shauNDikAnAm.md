Those who keep dogs for hunting purposes are called ‘*dog-keepers*.’

‘*Wine-sellers*,’—those who deal in wines; or those who make a living in
wine-shops.

‘*Clothes-washer*,’—he who washes and cleans clothes; another name for
them is ‘*Kāruka*.’

‘*Dyer*’—one who dyes clothes in blue and other colours.

‘*Nṛśaṃsa*’—is one who sings the praises of men, known as the ‘*bandī*,’
‘*bard*.’ Or, it may stand for the *pitiless man*.

He in whose house there lives the paramour of his wife.—(216)

‘*Nṛśaṃsa*’—‘cruel person’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘a
bard’ (Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, also suggested by Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
945),—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 496), which adds the
following—‘*Śvavān*’ is one who keeps dogs for
hunting-purposes,—‘*Śauṇḍika*’ is the liquor-seller,—‘*Celanirṇejaka*’
is one who lives by washing clothes,—‘*rajaka*’ is the
cloth-dyer,—‘*nṛśaṃsa*’ is one devoid of pity—and the man in whose house
a recognised paramour lives;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 774);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 251), which explains ‘*Śvavān*’ as ‘one who
keeps dogs for hunting purposes’ and remarks that ‘*Śauṇḍika*’ and the
other terms stand for the twice-born person who follows these
professions.

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.3, 6).—‘The miser, the initiated, the imprisoned, the
diseased, the Soma-seller, the carpenter, the dyer, the wine-seller, the
spy, the usurer, the dealer in leather, the Śūdra, the weapon-wielder,
the paramour, the person who permits a paramour, who burns houses, he
who kills for the sake of other people eating the meat. The gods eat not
the food of the dog-keeper, nor of the man who has a Śūdra wife, nor of
the man controlled by his wife, nor of one who permits a paramour in the
house.’

*Vyāsa* (3.51).—‘The actor, the wine-seller, the intoxicated, the
apostate and those who have neglected their vows.’

*Gautama* (17.18).—(See above.)

*Viṣṇu* (51.16-16).—‘One who makes a living by dogs, the wine-seller,
the oilsman, the clothes-washer, the woman in her courses, and of the
man who has a paramour in the house of his wife.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.163, 164).—(See above.)
