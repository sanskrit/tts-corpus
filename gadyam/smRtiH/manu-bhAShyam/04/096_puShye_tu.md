अर्धपञ्चमेषु मासेषु गतेषु यः **पुष्यो** नक्षत्रं तत्र्**ओत्सर्जनं** कर्तव्यम् । उत्सर्गोक्तं कर्म गृह्यकारैर् आम्नातम् । **बहिर्** इत्य् अनावृते देशे । अनयोर् उपाकर्मोत्सर्गयोर् गृह्यात् स्वरूपं ज्ञातव्यम् ॥ ४.९६ ॥

On the expiry of the four months and a half, when the *Puṣya* asterism
comes for the first time,—on that day, one should perform the
‘Utsarjana’ rite. The exact form of this rite has been described by the
authors of the *Gṛhyasūtras*.

*^(‘)Outside*’—*i.e*., in an uncovered place.

The exact form of these two rites—The ‘*Upākarma*’—and the ‘*Utsarjana*’
should be learnt from the *Gṛhyasūtras*.—(96)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 186), which adds that ‘if the
*Upākarma* has been performed on the Full-moon day of *Śrāvaṇa*, then
the *Utsarjana* should be performed on the first day of the bright
fortnight of *Pauṣa*, while if the *Upākarma* has been done in
*Bhādrapada*, then the *Utsarjana* should be done in *Māgha*’.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.143) to the effect that if the
*Upākarma* has been done in *Bhādrapada*, the *Utsarjana* should be done
in *Māgha*;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 521), which adds the same
two options as *Aparārka*;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 95), which also notes
the same two options;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 297), which says that
if the *Upākarma* has been done in Śrāvaṇa then the *Utsarjana* should
be done in Pauṣa, on the first day of the bright fortnight; but if the
former has been done in Bhādra then the latter should be done in Māgha
on the same day;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 405), which adds the same
remark;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 129), which has the same note;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 147), which says that ‘*śukla pratipadi
pūrvāhne*’ goes with both, and adds the same explanation as above.
