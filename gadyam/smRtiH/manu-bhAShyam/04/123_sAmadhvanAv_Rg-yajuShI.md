<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

While the Sāma-chant is being heard, one shall not recite either Ṛk
verses or the Yajuṣ Mantras. This prohibition does not Apply to the
Brāhmaṇas appertaining to the Ṛgveda and the Yajurveda; but the
prohibition does apply to the reading of such *Ṛk* and *Yajuṣ* Mantras
as happen to be contained in the *Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa* (of the
Sāma-Veda).

‘*End of the Veda*;’—*i.e*., when the Veda comes to an end. This refers
to the end of the Mantra (Saṃhitā) Text, as also to that of the
Brāhrnaṇa Text.

‘*Āraṇyaka*’ is the name of a portion of the Veda; after having read
this, one should not read any other hook.—(123)

unfit only for the reading of the Ṛgveda and the Yajurveda.

*Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 443);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 768);—and in
