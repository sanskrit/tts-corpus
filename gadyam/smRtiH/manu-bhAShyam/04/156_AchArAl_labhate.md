न चायम् एष विद्वत्तादिगुणसंपन्नः साध्यते । प्रजाया ह्य् एते गुणाः प्रार्थ्यन्ते । तद् उक्तम्-

- तया गवा कीम् क्रियते या न धेनुर् न गर्भिणी ।

- को ऽर्थः पुत्रेण जातेन यो न विद्वान् न धार्मिकः ॥ (पञ्चतन्त्र, प्रेलुदे, व्।३)

**अक्षय्यम्** अपि प्रभूतं यद् असद्व्यसनैर् अपि अक्षय्यम्[^२२०] । **अलक्षणं**[^२२१] स्कन्धोपरि तिलकादि दारिद्र्यादिदौर्भाग्यसूचकम् । तद् अप्य् **आचारो हन्ति** । तेन ह्य् अधर्म आचारपरत्वेन नश्यति ॥ ४.१५६ ॥

It is not meant that the child is made equipped with learning and other
good qualities; in fact, such qualities are considered desirable in
children. Says an old text—‘What is to be done with the cow that does
not give milk nor bear calf; what is the use of a son being born who is
neither learned nor righteous?’

‘*Inexhaustible*—vast; which cannot become exhausted, even through
vices.

‘*Everything inauspicious*;’—such marks as a black spot on the shoulder,
and the like, which are indications of poverty, misfortune, etc. This
also is destroyed by Right Conduct.

Thus all that is unrighteous and evil is destroyed, if a man sticks to
Right Conduct.—(156)

stated.

12);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 17a).

*Viṣṇu* (71.91).—(Same as Manu, but reading ‘*gatim*’ for ‘*prajām*.’)

*Vaśiṣṭha* (8.7).—(Do., but reading ‘*phalate dhanam*’ for ‘*labhate
prajām*’ and ‘*śriyamāpnoti*’ for ‘*dhanamakṣayyam*.’)

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 161.6).—‘By right conduct the man obtains
longevity; by right conduct he acquires prosperity; by right conduct he
acquires fame, here as well as after death.’

156	Through virtuous conduct he obtains long life, through virtuous conduct desirable offspring, through virtuous conduct imperishable wealth; virtuous conduct destroys (the effect of) inauspicious marks.
