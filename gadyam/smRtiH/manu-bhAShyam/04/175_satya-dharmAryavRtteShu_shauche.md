He shall always delight in truthfulness, Law and right conduct, as also in ceanliness (cleanliness?); he shall govern his pupils in accordance with law,—with his speech arms, and belly duly controlled.—(175)

‘*Truthfulness*,’—the habit of saying things just as they are seen.

‘*Law*,’—Injunctions and Prohibitions contained in the Veda.

Though Truthfulness also would be involved under ‘law,’ yet it has been
mentioned separately, with a view to emphasize its special importance.

The fact of the matter is that ‘untruthfulness’ being the very nature of
men, it is forbidden again and again with special emphasis.

‘*Right conduct*,’—the conduct of good men. ‘Good men’ are those that
are cultured; and the ‘conduct’ or course of action adopted by them.

In all these, ‘*he shall delight*.’ ‘Delight’ is *satisfaction*. Hence,
what the text enjoins is satisfaction with those just enumerated; the
sense being that ‘he should show satisfaction of mind at the sight of
all right forms of activity.’

‘*Pupils*,’—wife, son, slaves and students; these should be governed
‘*in accordance with law*;’ the law being what has been laid down in
this connection under 8.299, *et seq*.

‘*With his speech, amis and belly duly controlled*.’— Whether there be
necessity or not, if *one* does not speak much, this is what is called
‘control of speech.’ The ‘control of arms’ consists in not causing pain
to others by the strength of one’s arms. The ‘control of belly’ consists
in non-gluttony, not eating too much;—gluttony consisting in eating much
at other people’s houses, with special zest for a particular article of
food.

What has been already said before, is repeated over and over again,
because wholesome advice is to be given at all times. This is the
explanation of all repetitions.—(175)

*Gautama* (1, 50.68, 69, 70).—‘He shall never be fickle with the
generative organ, the stomach, the hands, the feet, speech and eyes. He
shall be devoted to Truthfulness and Rightful Conduct. He shall be the
instructor of well-disciplined pupils; practised in cleanliness, and
devoted to the Veda;—ever harmless, mild, firmly active, self-controlled
and charitable.’

175	Let him always delight in truthfulness, (obedience to) the sacred law, conduct worthy of an Aryan, and purity; let him chastise his pupils according to the sacred law; let him keep his speech, his arms, and his belly under control.
