महति दाने महति च तपसि महति च यज्ञे ज्योतिष्टोमादौ यद्य् असमर्थस् तदा नोदासीनेन भवितव्यम् । किं तर्हि, **शनैः** शनैः स्वल्पेन दानेन स्वल्पेन तपसा यथाशक्ति परोपकरेण जपहोमाभ्यां स्मार्ताभ्यां **धर्मः संचेतव्यः** । यथा मृत्संघातं **पुत्तिकाः** पिपीलिकाः संचिन्वन्ति । **परलोकसहायार्थम्** इति धर्मफलानुवादः । **सर्वभूतान्य् अपीडयन्** । याच्ञया धर्मार्थया भूतानां पीडा न कर्तव्या ॥ ४.२३८ ॥

If one is unable to bestow a large gift, or perform a difficult
austerity, or offer an elaborate sacrifice—like the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the
rest,—he should not he despondent on that account; on the contrary, he
should ‘*slowly*’ and gently ‘accumulate spiritual merit,’ by means of
small gifts, small austerities, by helping others, to the best of his
ability, and by muttering prayers and offering oblations prescribed in
the *Smṛtis*; just in the same manner in which white ants accumulate the
*ant-hill*.

‘*For the purpose of obtaining a companion in the other world*.’—This
describes the fruits of spiritual merit.

‘*Without causing pain to any beings*;’ *i.e*., even for the sake of
spiritual merit, he shall not go about begging and thereby causing pain
to others.—(238)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 232), which reads ‘*vaprikāḥ*’
for ‘*puttikāḥ*’, and explains it as ‘a particular kind of art’;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 64), which explains ‘*puttikā*’ as ‘a
kind of art’; and explains that this and the following verses are meant
to eulogise *Dharma*.

238	Giving no pain to any creature, let him slowly accumulate spiritual merit, for the sake (of acquiring) a companion to the next world, just as the white ant (gradually raises its) hill.
