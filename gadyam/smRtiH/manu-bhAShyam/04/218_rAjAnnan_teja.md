अथेदानीम् अतिक्रमफलं दर्शयति । **राजान्न**भोजिनस् **तेजो**नाशः । एवं सर्वत्र द्रष्टव्यम् । **सुवर्णकारा**दयः शब्दाः शिल्पिविशेषजीविनां वाचकाः । ये सुवर्णं जीविकार्थं घटयन्ति **सुवर्णकारा** उच्यन्ते । एवं रजकादिष्व् अपि द्रष्टव्यम् । चर्मावक्र्न्तति[^२७१] छिन्दति **चर्मावकर्तिनः** । तेन कर्मणा ये जीवन्ति तेषाम् एषा रूढिः । इह येषां पूर्वत्र प्रतिषेधो नास्ति केवलं दोषः श्रूयते तेषां तत एव प्रतिषेधो ऽनुमेयः ॥ ४.२१८ ॥

The Text now proceeds to describe the effects of transgressing the above
prohibitions.

One who eats the king’s food loses his vigour; and so with all the rest.

The terms ‘goldsmith’ and the rest, are denotative of particular
*professions*; so that those persons who deal in making articles of gold
are called goldsmiths. Similarly, with ‘dyer’ and other terms. Those who
cut leather are called ‘leather-cutters,’ this name being applied to
those who live by this trade.

In the present context, there are some whose food has not been forbidden
in the foregoing verses; but the evil results flowing therefrom are now
described; the prohibition of these is to be inferred from the
latter.—(218)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 507);—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 542) to the effect that the eating of King’s food
involves a heavy penance;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 782);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka*, (p. 352).

Śūdra’s food one’s Brāhmic glory; he who cats unpurified food, eats the
dirt of the earth.’
