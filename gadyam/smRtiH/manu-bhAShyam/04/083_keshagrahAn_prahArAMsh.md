Catching of the hair, as also striking on the head,—these he shall avoid; having his head bathed, he shall touch no limb with oil.—(83)

आत्मनः परस्य वेत्य् अविशेषेण <u>केचिद्</u> इच्छन्ति । <u>अन्ये</u> त्व् आत्मन इति प्रकृतम् अभिसंबध्नन्ति । क्रोधनिमित्तश् चायं प्रतिषेधः । सुरतसंभोगे तु कामिन्याः केशग्रहः, स न निषिध्यते । शिरःस्नानं क्षालितम् अनेनेति राजदन्तादेर् आकृतिगणत्वात् परनिपातः (च्ड़्। पाण् २.२.३१) । **शिरःस्नात** इति बाहुलकेन समासः । **नाङ्गम्** आत्मीयम् ॥ ४.८३ ॥

Some people hold that this refers to one’s own head, as well as to the
head of other persons; while others connect this with the term, ‘his
own,’ of the preceding verse.

What is forbidden here is the hair-catching, etc., done in anger; for
there is ‘hair-catching’ also during sexual intercourse, and this is not
forbidden.

The compound ‘*śiraḥ-snāta*’ is to be expounded as^(‘)*śiraḥ snātam
anena*,’ he whose head has been bathed, the order of the term being in
accordance with the rule governing such compounds as, by appearance,
belong to the ‘*Rājadanta*’ group (Pāṇini 2.2.31).

‘*He shall not touch any limb*’—of his own.—(83)

‘*Tailena*’—This, is construed by almost all the commentators with
‘*spṛśet*’, ‘one should not touch with oil any *limb* after having
bathed his head’; by others with ‘*Śiraḥsnātaḥ*’, ‘one who has anointed
his head *with oil* shall noṭ touch any limb’.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 183), which construes the second
line to mean ‘having anointed his head with oil, he shall not rub that
same oil over any other limb, or he shall not, during the rest of that
day, rub his body with any oil at all’.

083	Let him avoid (in anger) to lay hold of (his own or other men's) hair, or to strike (himself or others) on the head. When he has bathed (submerging) his head, he shall not touch any of his limbs with oil.
