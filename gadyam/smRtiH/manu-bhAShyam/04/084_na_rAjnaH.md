<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It has been said above (4.33) that ‘he shall seek for wealth form
Kings,’ This word, “king,” denoting the *lord of men*, has been found to
be applied to the *Kṣatriya* as well as the *non-Kṣatriya*; *e.g*., in
such expressions as ‘the Kingdom of Brāhmaṇas,’ Hence, in connection
with a rule regarding the acceptance of gifts, when we find a
prohibition, we take the term as standing for the *lord of men*;
specially, as in the present verse, we have the phrase ‘*not born of the
Kṣatriya caste*,’ Since it is possible for one to accept, through
avarice, the gifts of the lords of men, belonging to all castes, the
text has specified it; the sense being—‘one shall not accept gifts from
such a lord of men as is not born of the *Kṣatriya* caste; nor even from
the *Kṣatriya* king, who does not behave according to the scriptures as
will be made clear by the prohibition coming later on.

‘*Sūnā*’ is *slaughter-house*; and he who lives by selling meat, after
having slaughtered the animal, is called a butcher,’ a ‘keeper of the
slaughter-house.’

Similarly, ‘*cakravān*’ is one who lives by oil-pressing; who is known
among men as ‘*khaṭika*.’

‘*Dhvaja*’ is wine-shop; and the ‘*dhvajavān*’ is he who lives by buying
and selling wine

‘*Veśa*’ is brothel; he who lives by this—be it a man or a woman.—(84)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 218), which adds that the
‘king’ here spoken of is one who tyrannises over his subjects;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 410).

**(verses 4.84-85)**

*Yājñavalkya* (1.141).—\[‘He shall not accept any gifts from a king who
is greedy and who acts against the scriptures.’\]

‘In the matter of acceptance of gifts, the butcher, the oil-presser, the
wine-vendor, the prostitute and the king are all condemned, each
succeeding one being ten times worse than the preceding.’

*Yama* (4, 58).—‘Gifts from the king should be avoided by those who are
desirous of winning the three worlds; by accepting the gift of a king,
one’s Brāhmaṇahood disappears.’

*Saṃvarta* (quoted in Parāśaramādhava, p. 199).—‘The king’s gift is
something terrible; it is like wine-drinking, and like poison; it is
better to feed on the flesh of one’s own son, than to accept of the
king’s gift.’
