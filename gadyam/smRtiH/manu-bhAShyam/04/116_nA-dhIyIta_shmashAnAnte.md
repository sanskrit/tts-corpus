The term ‘*anta*’ means *proximity*. The meaning is that he shall not
study in close proximity to the cremation-ground, or in close proximity
to a village.

‘*Cow-pasture*’—where cows goto graze. Or, ‘*govraja*’ may mean the
‘*cow-pen*.’

‘He shall not read with the same cloth on him which he had on while
having intercourse with his wife;’ the term ‘*maithuna*’ denoting,
through association, the *cloth worn during intercourse*.

‘*In connection with funeral rites*;’—he shall not read after having
accepted such presents as dry food, and the like.—(116)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 534), which
explains the third quarter to mean that ‘one should not read the Veda
when wearing the cloth that he had worn at the time of sexual
intercourse’; and adds that this refers to cases where the cloth has not
been washed after the act;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 770), which explains
‘*ante*’ as ‘near’ and ‘*maithunam vāsaḥ*’ as ‘the cloth, clad in which
he has had sexual intercourse’; he should not wear this—without its
being washed—while reading;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 56);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 160), which reproduces the same remarks as
those in *Hemādri*;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 195).
