**पाणिपादाभ्यां चपलः** । "तृतीया" (पाण् २.१.३०) इति योगविभागात् समासः । चापलं च हस्तेनानुपयुज्यमानस्यापि वस्तुनो ग्रहणापसारणे । परस्त्रीप्रेक्षणचित्रसंदर्शनादि **नेत्रचापलम्** । **परद्रोहार्थं कर्मबुद्धिश्** च न कर्तव्या ॥ ४.१७७ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The compound in ‘*pāṇipādacapalaḥ*’ is the instrumental *Tatpuruṣa*, in
accordance with Pāṇini’s Sūtra 2.1.30. The ‘fickleness’ of the hand
would consist in the picking up or removing of useless things.

The ‘fickleness’ of the eye would consist in looking at other women, or
at pictures, etc.

He shall not net or think in such a manner as would bring harm to
others.—(177).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 524), as setting
forth an epitome of what one’s ‘duty’ is;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (I., p.
695),—and again in II, p. 204, in connection with *tilaka* marks on the
forehead;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 275) to the effect that even when
living in foreign lands one should keep up the ways of his fathers;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1680);—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 68), which says
that this refers to cases of optional alternatives only;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 71a);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 9) to the effect that family-custom is to be regarded as a guide in
cases where there is a difference of opinion among the various
scriptural texts.
