The text states the evil results following from the illiterate man
accepting the gift of certain specified things.—‘He becomes reduced to
ashes, like wood;’—just as wood, on being burnt by fire, becomes reduced
to ashes, so the Brāhmaṇa, who is not endowed with proper learning,
becomes reduced to ashes, by accepting the gift of gold and other things
mentioned here.—(188).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (6.30).—‘The illiterate person, accepting the cow or gold or
cloth, or land or sesamum, becomes reduced to ashes, like wood.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.201-202).—‘Cows, land and sesamum, should be
respectfully offered by the wise man who desires his own welfare to a
proper recipient and never to an improper person; the latter accepting
the gift, drops the giver downwards.’

*Bṛhad-Yama* (58).—‘Just as when milk, curd, butter and honey placed in
an unbaked vessel becomes destroyed through the weakness of the vessel,
and the vessel also becomes destroyed, in the same manner, when an
illiterate person accepts the gift of cows or gold or clothes or food or
land or sesamum, he becomes reduced to ashes like wood.’
