He shall diligently recite the Veda, whenever he finds time. They declare this to be his primary duty; everything else is declared to be his secondary duty.—(147)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It has been said above that he should recite and offer oblations; and
now he states the means of doing the *reciting*.—‘*He shall recite the
Veda*’ The rest of the verse is purely commendatory.

‘*Whenever he finds time*’—the *Avyayībhāva* compound ‘*yathākālam*’
signifying *repetition*. The meaning is that ‘whenever the man happens
to be free from, all. worldly activity, he should recite the Veda.’ The
other duties—such as the performance of the *Agnihotra* and the
like—have their fixed time; while for *recitation*, *purity* is the only
condition.

This is the ‘*primary duty*;’ all else is ‘*secondary
duty*;’—‘*upadharma*’ means ‘nearly as good as duty.’ This compound,
therefore, is *Tatpuruṣa*, and not *Avyayībhāva*,—according to Pāṇini
2.1.55.

This deprecation of other duties is meant to be a praise of Vedic
recitation, and it is not meant to be a prohibition of those.—(147)

*Cf*. 2.237.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, on p. 69, and again on p. 229;—and
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 320), which explains ‘*upadharmaḥ*’ as
‘small dharma; *i.e*., such penances as the *Kṛcchra* and the like’.

*Yājñāvalkya* (1.40).—‘From among all sacrifices, austerities and other
meritorious acts, the Veda alone is what secures the highest good for
twice-born men.’

*Vyāsa* (Vīramitrodaya, Saṃskāra, p. 508).—‘Dharma is not known by any
other means, it grew out of the Veda alone; therefore for the purposes
of sacrifice, one should have recourse to the Veda only.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Do., p. 511).—‘Without the Veda one cannot he a Brāhmaṇa.’

*Atri* (151).—‘There is no scripture superior to the Veda; there is no
elder superior to the mother; there is no friend superior to
charity,—either here or in the next world.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (1.14.12).—‘There is no refuge beyond the Veda.’

147	Let him, without tiring, daily mutter the Veda at the proper time; for they declare that to be one's highest duty; (all) other (observances) are called secondary duties.
