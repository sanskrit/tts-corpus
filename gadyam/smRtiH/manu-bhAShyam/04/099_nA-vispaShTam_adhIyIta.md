यत्र वर्णस्वराभिव्यक्तिः स्फुटा न भवति तद् **अविस्पष्टम्** । तच् च द्रुतायां वृत्तौ प्रायेण भवति । **निशान्ते** पश्चिमरात्रिभागे । सुप्तोत्थितो यदाधीयीत पुनः श्राम्येत् तदा न शयीत । "न निशान्ते परिश्रान्तो ब्रह्माधीत्य शयीत तु" एवं युक्तः पाठः ॥ ४.९९ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Indistinct*’—when the letters and accents are not clearly pronounced.
This happens when a man is reciting hurriedly.

‘*At the end of night*’— in the latter part of night. If he, on rising
from sleep, study the Veda, he shall not, if he becomes tired, go to
sleep again. The right reading is—‘*na niśānte pariśrānto brahmādhītya
śayīta tu*.’—(99)

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (l.9.9-11).—‘The Śūdra and the outcast are like
