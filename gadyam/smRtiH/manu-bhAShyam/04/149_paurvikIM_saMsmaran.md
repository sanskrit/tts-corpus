“Every man undertakes an action only when he desires to accomplish
thereby something desirable. The recollection of former births, however,
cannot be entirely pleasant. Why then is this described as the result
following Vedic Study and the other three acts?”

In view of this question, the Author says—‘*Recollecting his former
births, he continues to study the Veda*,’ *i.e*., he acquires faith in
it; the idea being—‘Vedic study is such a good thing that it has enabled
me to remember my other births.’ Hence, recollecting his other births,
he again betakes himself to that study; and from this continuous Vedic
study extending over several lives, ‘*he obtains*’—acquires—‘*bliss*’—in
the form of the ‘attainment of Brahman’:—‘*absolute*’—*i.e*., without
the chance of returning. The term ‘*endless*’ indicates a particular
kind of bliss,—the self-sufficient complete satisfaction of the Soul;
and the eternal character of this bliss is what is expressed by the term
‘*ajasram*,’ ‘*absolute*;’ the meaning being that ‘such and such a bliss
is attained, and it never perishes.’ Though the two terms (‘absolute’
and endless’) are synonymous, yet they are not entirely tautological.
Just as, in the case of the expression, ‘*vṛttakam vahataḥ purīṣam*,’ or
‘*vṛttakam udakam purīṣam*,’—where one (the term ‘*vṛttakam*’) is the
conventional and the other (‘*purīṣam*’) the literal or etymological
name of the thing; ‘*purīṣam*’ denotes, literally, *that which fills*,
so that this latter stands for the *soli* *d*, and the former for the
*liquid*, ordure.—(149)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 229);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 320), which explains ‘*Brahma*’ as ‘Veda,’—and ‘*anantam*’
as ‘to be enjoyed for a long time.’

149	He who, recollecting his former existences, again recites the Veda, gains endless bliss by the continual study of the Veda.
