Trade is “Truth and Falsehood;” even by that one may live. Service has been declared, to be the “living of dogs;” hence one should avoid it.—(6)

नैवं मन्तव्यं सत्यानृतोभयरूपता शास्त्रेण वाणिज्ये ऽभ्यनुज्ञायत इति । किं तर्हि, वस्तुस्वभाववादो ऽयम् । लोभग्रहणम् एवानृतम् । **जीव्यत** इति वचनाद् वाणिज्या जीवनायैव, न धनसंचयाय । **सेवा श्ववृत्तिः** । यथा हि श्वा प्रेर्यते, कृच्छ्रेण च लभते, तथा च सेवकः । सेवा प्रेष्यत्वम् । यत्र कुत्रचित् कर्मणि प्रेष्यते, उचिते ऽनुचिते वा, स सेवकः । अत उत्कृष्टेनायुधकर्मादिना ये राजानम् उपसर्पन्ति ते न श्ववृत्तयः ॥ ४.६ ॥

It should not be understood that the scripture here lays down the fact
of Trade being both ‘true’ and ‘false;’ it only describes the nature of
the thing; and what constitutes the ‘falsehood’ of Trade is the element
of avaricious grabbing involved in it.

‘*May live*.’—This implies that Trade may be had recourse to, only for
the purposes of livelihood, never for that of accumulating wealth.

‘*Service is the living* *of* *the dog*.’—The dog is made to work hard,
and gets little and with difficulty; so also the servant. ‘*Service*’
here connotes being *ordered about*; the servant is always commanded to
do this and that work, right as well as wrong. Hence, when people serve
kings with such superior kind of work as the carrying of arms and the
like, these are not regarded ‘as the living of dogs,’—(6)

006	But trade and (money-lending) are Satyanrita, even by that one may subsist. Service is called Svavritti; therefore one should avoid it.
