**अन्तरागमने** ऽध्याप्याध्यापकयोर् मध्येन, अधीयानानां वा । **अहर्निशम्** अहोरात्रम् । गौतमे तु- "त्र्यहम् उपवासो विप्रवासश् चोक्तः" (ग्ध् १.५९) । श्मशानाध्ययने च एतद् एव । अत्र विकल्पो विज्ञेयः ॥ ४.१२६ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Come between*’—between the teacher and the pupil, or Among the several
students themselves.

‘*Aharnisham*’—Day and night.

Gautama (1.59), however, has declared—‘Fasting and living outside for
three days has been laid down;’ and the same holds good regarding
reading in the cremation-ground.

What is laid down in the present text is to be regarded as an option to
what has been declared by Gautama—(l 26)
