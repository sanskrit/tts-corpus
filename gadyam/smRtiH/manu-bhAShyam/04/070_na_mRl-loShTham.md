‘*Crushing*’ means *breaking into pieces*—of clods of earth; some people
hold that this refers also to such clods of earth as are mixed with lime
or other mortar. The ‘crushing’ of the earth-clod, consists either in
raising it and then throwing it down, or by pressing it with the hands.

The crushing that is forbidden here is one that is done aimlessly; nor
when it is done for the purpose of being used in cleaning the hands,
etc.,—the term ‘aimless’ of the next line being construed with this
also. Though, as such, the crushing would be included under the ‘aimless
act,’ yet it has been mentioned separately, with a view to the different
expiatory rite that has been prescribed in connection with it.

‘*Karaja*’ are nails.

‘*No aimless act*.’—*Objection*—“The *aimless act* has been already
prohibited under ‘purposeless exertion’ (63).”

Some people offer the following explanation:—‘*Exertion*’ denotes
*physical activity*; while what is forbidden here is *activity in
general* (in all its forms); which means that the building of airy
castles is to be avoided.

‘*Āyati*’ denotes *future time*. That act from which there follows, in
the future, some disagreeable, result; *e.g*., eating to indigestion,
spending one’s wealth without any consideration for the maintenance of
one’s family and dependants. All this he shall not do.—(70)

In support of the. above, we have the following commendatory
description—

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 183), which explains ‘*āyati*’ as
‘*pariṇāma*’, ‘result’—‘*Karma*’ as *Saṅkalpa* ‘volition’,
‘determination’; and this is ‘fruitless,’ ‘*niṣphala*’, when it turns
out to be *false*, *i.e*., when the determination is not carried into
practice; as regards the crushing of clods etc., what is to be avoided
is the *habit* of doing it;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 72).
