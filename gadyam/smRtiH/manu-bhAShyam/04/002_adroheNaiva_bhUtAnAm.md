By ‘*trouble*’ here is meant, not only *harm*, but the unpleasant
feeling or displeasure that is produced in the mind of one who is
constantly begged with the words ‘give me this,’ ‘give me that;’—the
*harming* of others being already generally prohibited.

‘*Little trouble*;’—If he cannot manage to live without begging, he
should beg very little. This is what.is meant by ‘little trouble.’

That ‘*means of livelihood*’—means of subsistence, such as agriculture,
service, and the like—which means does not cause trouble to other
persons,—such a means of subsistence should be taken to.

This is a general advice.

‘*By taking to that means...he should subsist*.’

What is to be done in abnormal times of distress shall be laid down in
Discourse X.

From what is said here it follows that there are also other means of
living than those that are going to be described. Otherwise, if the
present text referred to those only that are going to be described,
there would be no point in the general injunction here put forward. Thus
it is that we get at such means of living as ‘officiating at
sacrifices,’ ‘teaching,’ ‘money-lending,’ and so forth,—even though
these are not mentioned among ‘*amṛta*’ and the rest enumerated here.

‘Living on gleanings,’ which has been accepted as a very small means of
subsistence, is what is meant by ‘involving little trouble.’ Says
Gautama (10.6)—‘Agriculture and Trade, done through others, as also
money-lending.’

What is here laid down is the means of mere subsistence; the amassing of
wealth is to be done by the few specialised means going to be
enumerated.—(2)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.128), which says that what is

p. 246);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 215);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika,

*Viṣṇu* (2.11).—‘For the Brāhmaṇa, officiating at sacrifices and
receiving of gifts.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.4-6).—‘The Brāhmaṇa’s *own occupation*,
consists of studying, teaching, sacrificing, officiating at sacrifices,
making gifts, receiving gifts, inheriting of property and gleaning and
picking; also such others as may not have been adopted by others.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.69).—‘If unable to maintain himself by teaching,
officiating at sacrifices, and receiving of gifts, he may live by the
occupation of the Kṣatriya; this being the next best for him.’

*Atri* (13).—‘The occupation of the Brāhmaṇa consists of sacrificing,
making gifts, studying, austerities, receiving gifts, teaching and
officiating at sacrifices; these are the means of his livelihood.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 29).—‘For the householder, living by the means
prescribed for him, marrying in families not belonging to the same
Ṛṣi-gotra, approaching his wife only during her periods, making
offerings to gods, Pitṛs, guests and dependants and feeding on what
remains.’

002	A Brahmana must seek a means of subsistence which either causes no, or at least little pain (to others), and live (by that) except in times of distress.
