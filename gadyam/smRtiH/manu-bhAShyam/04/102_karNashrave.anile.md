When the wind blows with force, a sound is heard, which is produced by
the impact of another (contrary) wind; this is what is called the ‘*air
audible by the ear*.’ That which is heard by the ears is called
‘*audible by the ear*;’ the compound being between the instrument (ear)
and the noun formed by a verbal affix. The term ‘ear’ is added for the
purpose of indicating a particular condition, because hearing is always
by means of ears. The meaning is that ‘when the sound of wind is heard,
study should not be carried on.’

‘*Dust-whorl*’—that which brings together dust; ‘*pāṃsu*’ meaning
*dust*; this is mentioned only as indicative of the wind that produces
it (*i.e*., the dust-storm). The meaning is that ‘after it has rained,
whenever such a wind blows, that time shall be regarded as unfit for
study.’

‘*Versed in the rules of teaching*,’—who are conversant with the rules
regulating the practice of teaching.—(102)

102	Those who know the (rules of) recitation declare that in the rainy season the Veda-study must be stopped on these two (occasions), when the wind is audible at night, and when it whirls up the dust in the day-time.
