‘*Clinging pursuits*’ are those to which people become addicted; just as
singing and music; to these passionate persons *cling*, as it were.
Hence one shall not ‘seek’ —*i.e*., earn wealth by means of singing and
music.

‘*Contrary act*’—*i.e*., that which is forbidden by the scriptures, or
iś not in accordance with the usages of one’s family.

‘*Nor when wealth*’—enough for subsistence—‘*is already there*’—having
been inherited from father and others;—one shall not seek for more,

‘*Even in times of distress, not from here and there*.’—As a rule, one
should subsist on presents received from proper persons; but, in rare
cases, the scripture shall permit a contrary course also, in times of
distress.—(15)

‘*Prasaṅgena*’—‘Music, singing and such other things to which man
becomes addicted’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka Rāghavānanda and
Nandana);—‘with too great eagerness’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 59).

*Yājñavalkya* (1.129).—‘He shall not seek for such wealth as may be
incompatible with Vedic Study; nor from here and there; nor by recourse
to what is improper; and he shall remain ever contented.’

*Gautama* (9.49).—‘Among Dharma, Artha and Kāma, he shall attach the
greatest importance to Dharma.’

015	Whether he be rich or even in distress, let him not seek wealth through pursuits to which men cleave, nor by forbidden occupations, nor (let him accept presents) from any (giver whosoever he may be).
