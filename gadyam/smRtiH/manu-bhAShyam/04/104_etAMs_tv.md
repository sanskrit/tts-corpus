When these appear after the Fires have been lighted, then is it to be regarded as time unfit for study; as also when clouds are seen out of season.—(104)

नायम् अनध्यायो यस्यां कस्यांचन वेलायाम् उपजातेष्व् एतेषु, किं तर्हि **प्रादुष्कृताग्निषु** । संध्याकाल इत्य् अर्थः । तदा ह्य् अग्नयो जुहूषया नियमतः प्रादुष्क्रियन्ते । प्रादुःशब्दः प्राकाश्ये । **अनृतौ** । ऋतुर् वार्षास् ताभ्यो ऽन्यः शरदादिः । तत्र व्**आभ्रदर्शन्**ए । **प्रादुष्कृताग्निष्व्** इत्य् अपेक्ष्यते ॥ ४.१०४ ॥

It does not make the time unfit for study, if the said things appear at
any time: it is only when they appear, *after the Fires have been
lighted*,’ ‘*prāduṣkṛtāgniṣu*;’—*i.e*., at the time of twilight; as it
is only at these times that the Fires are always set ablaze for the
purpose of pouring the libations. The term ‘*prāduṣ*’ signifies
*visibility*.

‘*Out of season*.’—The ‘season’ is the Rainy season; other than this is
the time beginning with the autumn; During that time, if clouds *are
seen*. This also is meant to be taken along with the phrase, ‘*after the
Fires have been lighted*.’—(104).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 530), which notes
that the ‘*agniprāduṣkaraṇa*’ indicates the *morning twilight*; and that
this *Anadhyāya* also is to be *ākālikā* (see verse 103);—in *Hemādri*
(Kāla, p. 761);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 58) in support of the view that
the phenomena referred to should occur in the evening, or morning, and
that there is no ‘holiday’ due to the mere appearance of clouds during
the rainy season; it quotes

*Dharmaprakāśa* to the effect that ‘*prāduṣkṛtāgniṣu*’ (morning and
evening) is to be taken with the ‘appearance of clouds’ also;—in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 194);—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 566),
which explains ‘*prāduṣkṛtāgniṣu*’ as ‘at the times when the fire is
kindled for the morning and evening Libations’, *i.e*., morning and
evening, and the verse as meaning—‘when the three phenomena of lightning
and the rest are perceived during the season (Rains), then one day and
night should be treated as holiday’, and *apart from the Rainy season*,
if mere clouds appear in the morning or evening, one day and night
should be observed; but not so during the rains; the particle ‘*ca*’
implies that when lightning and thunder are heard apart from the Rainy
season, there will be a holiday for one day and night;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 149), which explains ‘*prāduṣkaraṇa*’, as
‘*viharaṇa*’, furbishing,—and says it denotes the Twlights.

*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 197) quotes the opinion of *Kalpataru* to
the effect that on the appearance of each of the phenomena individually,
only the time of the appearance is to be treated as holiday. It adds
that the accepted practice is that whenever dense clouds appear, apart
from the Rains, it is treated as a holiday.

104	When one perceives these (phenomena) all together (in the twilight), after the sacred fires have been made to blaze (for the performance of the Agnihotra), then one must know the recitation of the Veda to be forbidden, and also when clouds appear out of season.
