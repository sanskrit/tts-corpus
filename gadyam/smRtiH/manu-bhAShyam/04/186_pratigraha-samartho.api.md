<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The ‘gift’ here meant is what one obtains from another person, who gives
it with a view to some transcendental reward. Even though one may *be*‘
*entitled*’—*i.e*., fit—to accept such a gift, one shall avoid getting
into the habit of doing it again and again. The ‘*title*’ or ‘fitness’
here meant consists in being endowed with an excellence of learning,
study, and character, and possessing full knowledge of things and laws.
Hence, what is stated in the second half of the verse is only the
reiteration of what has been said above regarding the ignorant person
fearing etc. (191)—(186).

*Viṣṇu* (57.6, 7, 9).—‘He shall avoid being addicted to receiving gifts
from persons whose gifts should not be accepted; by the acceptance of
such gifts the spiritual light of Brāhmaṇas becomes extinguished; even
though entitled to receive gifts he shall avoid becoming addicted to
it.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.213).—‘If one, though entitled to receive gifts, does
not accept them, he obtains those spacious regions which are meant for
the extremely charitable persons.’

186	Though (by his learning and sanctity) he may be entitled to accept presents, let him not attach himself (too much) to that (habit); for through his accepting (many) presents the divine light in him is soon extinguished.
