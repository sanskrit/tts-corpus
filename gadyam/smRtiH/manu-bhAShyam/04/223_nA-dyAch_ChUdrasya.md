<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Śūdra’s food has been forbidden generally; and particular details
regarding it are now laid down—‘*who does not perform Śrūddhas*.

“Where has Śūdra’s food been forbidden?”

It has been forbidden in 4. 211.

“What is forbidden there is Śūdra’s *leavings*, and not other kinds of
food.”

Not so; the said verse (211) is to be construed as—‘the Śūdra’s food
should not be eaten, *nor the leavings of others*.’ The explanation that
we gave above of this verse, was in accordance with the older
Commentators; as we clearly pointed out there.

‘*Who does not perform Śrāddhas*.’—‘*Śrāddha*’ here stands for the
*sacrificing of cooked food* and such other rites as have been
prescribed for the Śūdra; hence, the meaning is ‘who does nor perform
these rites.’ What is meant is that ‘one shall not eat the cooked food
of any *Śūdra*, except those of the better class.’

Another reading is ‘*aśraddhinaḥ*’ (for ‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*); which means,
‘who is devoid of faith;’ in the next verse also we find special stress
laid down upon ‘faith,’ by the term ‘*vadānya*,’ ‘liberal.’

‘*Raw*’—dry; paddy, rice, and so forth.

‘*Sufficient for one day*’—just that quantity which may suffice for one
day,—not more.—(223)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 341), which explains
‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*’ as ‘one who does not offer the daily Śrāddhas’; and adds
that this is meant to indicate the compulsory character of these
Śrāddhas,—and ‘*ekarātrikam*’ is explained as ‘what is enough for one
day.”

Buhler notes that Nārāyaṇa explains ‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*’ as ‘destitute of
faith’. But the reading thus explained must be ‘*aśraddhinaḥ*’ which is
a var: lec: noted by Medhātithi.

The verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 490) which adds that
the term ‘*Śrāddha*’ here must be taken as standing for the *Pākayajña*,
which is prescribed for the *Śūdra*;—he who performs that is called
‘*Śrāddhin*’;—if a Śūdra does not perform it, his ‘cooked food’ should
not be eaten;—such is the explanation given by Medhātithi. *Kalpataru*
on the other hand, has explained the term ‘*Śrāddha*’ as standing for
the *daily Śrāddhas*. In some places the word is read as
‘*Aśraddhinaḥ*’, which means ‘devoid of faith’.—In the event of
‘abnormal distress’—‘*avṛttau*’—one should receive from him uncooked—not
cooked—rice or other grain, just enough to last for one day.

It is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 250);—in *Prāyascittaviveka*
(p. 253), which explains ‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*’ as the Śūdra ‘who is not
entitled to partake of Śrāddha food’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
785);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 320).

*Parāśara* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 492).—‘The food remains ‘Śūdra’s
food’ only so long as as it has not been touched by the twice-born; as
soon as it has been touched by the twice-born’s hand, it becomes sacred
food.’

*Yama* (Do.).—‘Śūdra’s food when placed in a vessel belonging to the
twice-born is not objectionable.’

*Viṣṇu-purāṇa* (Do.).—‘When Śūdra’s food comes to one’s house, it should
be eaten after water has been sprinkled over it.’

*Āpastamba* (1.18, 3 *et. seq*.).—‘ He may accept uncooked food; or even
cooked food, such as is devoid of relish; he should desist after getting
just what would keep him alive.’

*Aṅgiras* (68-73).—‘He who eats the Śūdra’s food continuously for a
mouth, even during that same life, becomes a Śūdra, and after death, is
born a dog. There is no rise upwards for one who reads, sacrifices or
offers oblations while nourished by food given by the Śūdra. If a man
has recourse to his wife after eating of the food given by a Śūdra, the
son begotten by him belongs to that Śūdra. If a man dies with Śūdra’s
food in his stomach, he is born as a hog, or is born in the family of
that same Śūdra.’

*Gautama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 489).—‘Food may be begged from all
castes, with, the exception of such persons as are accused or outcast.’

*Hārita* (Do., p. 490).—‘One who dies with Śūdra’s food in his stomach
is born as a mule or a camel, and becomes a Śūdra.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Do.).—‘The twice-born man dying with Śūdra’s food in his
stomach becomes a hog, etc., etc.’

*Yama* (Do., p. 491).—‘The Agnihotrin who does not desist from Śūdra’s
food loses his soul, his Veda and his three Fires.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Do.).—‘The householder who eats Śūdra’s food loses his
strength and vigour.’
