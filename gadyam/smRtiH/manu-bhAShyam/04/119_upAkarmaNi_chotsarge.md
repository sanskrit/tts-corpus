It has been said above (verse 97) that, at the *Utsarjana* ceremony, one
night, along with the preceding and the following days, has deen
declared to be unfit for study; and with that the present text lays down
the option of observing ‘three days.’ But, in connection with the
‘Upākarma,’ this is the original Injunction.

‘*Aṣṭakās*’—*i. e*., the three or four eighth nights during the
fortnights following after the Full-Moon of the month of *Āgrahāyaṇa*.
Though it has been said above that the whole day and night is to be
observed on the eighth days of all fortnights, yet its mention in the
present connection is only right and proper, as emphasizing the
obligatory character of the rule; and, throughout the present context,
we have to regard two rules as optional only when each is found to be
self-sufficient.

‘*On the last nights of the seasons*;’—‘one day and night’ is to be
construed with this also. There are six seasons; and the *day* on which
one ends and the other begins, is to be regarded as unfit for study; and
the mention of ‘night’ is only by way of an indicative.—(119).
