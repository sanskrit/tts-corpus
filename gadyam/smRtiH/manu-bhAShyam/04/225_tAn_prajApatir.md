Thereupon Prajāpati came to them and said—“Do not make the unequal equal: what belongs to the liberal man is purified by faith, while the other is defiled by want of faith.—(225)

Prajāpati, having approached, said to the gods —‘*Do not in this way,
make the unequal eaual*’—*i.e*., do not establish any such improper
equalisation.

Then the gods asked—‘Who there is, then, the superior between the two
persons?’

Then Prajāpati answered—‘The food that belongs to the liberal-minded
usurer, who is endowed with faith, is purified by faith, while the other
food, that belongs to the Vedic scholar, is censured, condemned, by his
act (faithlessness).’

This dialogue between Prajāpati and the gods is purely imaginary; all
that is meant is that ‘one shall not eat food offered by a person, who,
though otherwise qualified, is devoid of faith, while that belonging to
the *Śūdra* shall be eaten, if it is offered with due respect.’—(225)

225	The Lord of created beings (Pragapati) came and spake to them, 'Do not make that equal, which is unequal. The food of that liberal (usurer) is purified by faith; (that of the) of the) other (man) is defiled by a want of faith.'
