Of the man that disdains it, the Pitṛs do no eat any food for ten and five years; nor does fire convey his offering to the gods.—(249)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is an imaginary assertion, deprecating the non-acceptance of the
said gifts.

That person who disdains, refuses to accept it,—his *Śrāddha* the
‘*Pitṛs do not eat*’—do no accept; nor does Fire convey his offerings to
the gods. That is, such a man does not derive any benefit from rites
performed for the *Pitṛs* or for the gods.

In this connection, some one has asserted that—“Even though what is
offered happens to be of no use, it should be accepted, as a favour to
the giver.”

This, however, is not right; as all that the text means is that gift,
offered unasked, may be accepted without harm; and what is said here is
a counter-exception, and there can be ‘counter-exception’ only in favour
of what has been forbidden; so that, what may he had recourse to by
reason of ordinary want having been forbidden (by a previous text), the
present text lays down a counter-exception.—(249)
