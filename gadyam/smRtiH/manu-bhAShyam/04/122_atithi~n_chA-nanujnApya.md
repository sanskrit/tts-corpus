The ‘*guest*’ here stands for gentlemen in general. The ‘guest’ is a
gentleman who happens to arrive by chance; and, when such a gentleman
has arrived, the Veda shall be studied, but only after his permission
has been obtained with the words, ‘May I proceed with my study.’ Says
another *Smṛti-text*,—‘When a gentleman has come to the house.’

When the winds blows ‘*vehemently*’—*i.e*., with great force.

*Objection*.—“Study has already been forbidden ‘when air is audible by
the ear’ (102), and so forth.”

True. But what is meant by the present text is that when the wind blows
with greater force than what has been mentioned before (in 102); or, it
may sefer to the wind blowing apart from the rains. That such is the
meaning is indicated by the usual meaning of the root ‘vā,’ ‘to blow,’
which means *to dry up*; and wind (apart from the rains) always tends to
dry up things; and in this sense, the term ‘*māruta*’ shall stand for
the constituent elements of’ the body; and the meaning in this case (of
the term ‘*vāti*’) shall be that—‘when the constituents of the man’s
body have been dried up by the labours of study’; the whole phrase
(‘*mārute vāti*’) would thus mean—‘when the wind is blowing high and the
reader is emaciated,’—there being no co-ordination between the two
locatives (in ‘*mārute*’ and ‘*vāti*’).

When blood has flowed, through the bite of leeches and such other
insects; or when blood has flowed, by reason of his body being wounded
by a weapon. The term, ‘from the body,’ is to be construed with both
clauses. (122).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 536);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 164);—in

*Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 774), which explains the meaning as ‘when the
Brāhmaṇa arrives, the reader should offer him water etc., and then
having obtained his permission, he should proceed with his study’;—and
in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 196).
