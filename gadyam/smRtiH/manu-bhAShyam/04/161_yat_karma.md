आत्मतुष्टेः प्रागुक्तायाः पुनर् वचनं स्मरणार्थम् । विषयश् च तस्या दर्शन एव । यत्र कर्मणि क्रियमाणे किंकथिका न भवति, तत् कर्तयम् । यत्र तु हृदयं न तुष्यति, तद् वर्जनीयम् ॥ ४.१६१ ॥

The ‘soul’s satisfaction’, already mentioned before, is mentioned again
for recalling it to the mind; and its exact scope has already been
explained.

While an act is being performed, if there arises in the mind no sort of
doubt or hesitation, then that act should he proceeded with. But, if the
mind is not satisfied in regard to an action, that action should be
avoided.—(161)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 224), which explains ‘*Karma*’ as
‘*Dharma*’;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 524);—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 14), which adds that the ‘act’ here mentioned must be such as is not
incompatible with the teachings of scriptures; though even in regard to
such acts, there are exceptions; *e.g*., even though an act may have
been enjoined by the scriptures, it should not be done if it is against
popular opinion;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 71b).

161	When the performance of an act gladdens his heart, let him perform it with diligence; but let him avoid the opposite.
