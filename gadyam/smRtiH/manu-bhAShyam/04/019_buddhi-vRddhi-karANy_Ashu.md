‘*As* *enliven the intelligence*,’—*e.g*., Itihāsas, Purāṇas, Treatises
on the Science of Reasoning, and also those written by Bṛhaspati, Uśanas
and others.

‘*Beneficial*’—productive of benefit; *i.e*., leading to perceptible
desirable results; such for instance, as the Sciences of Medicine and
Astronomy;—the Science of Polity being mentioned separately (under those
‘conducive to wealth’).

‘*Vedic Scriptures*.’—This term stands here for those sciences that are
helpful in understanding the meaning of the Veda; such sciences for
instance, as those of Exegesis. Etymologies, Grammar and Interpretation,

If the term stood for the Vedic texts themselves, these would be
conducive to imperceptible (and not perceptible) results.—(19).

‘*Nigamas*’—According to Medhātithi, the term *Nigamas* does not mean
the *Aṅgas*, as stated by Buhler,—but it includes
Nigama—Nirukta—Vyākaraṇa—Mīmāṃsā;—Kullūka explains the term as ‘works,
called *Nigama*, explanatory of the meaning of the Veda’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 127), which explains ‘*Nigamān*’
as ‘the Nighaṇṭu and other works that help in ascertaining the meanings
of words’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 509) as laying down what
should be studied;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 155), which explains
‘*buddhivṛddhikarāṇi*’ as ‘Tarka, Mīmāṃsā and the rest,’—*dhanyāni*’ as
‘the *Arthaśāstras*, which are conducive to the acquisition of
wealth,’—‘*hitāni*’ as ‘the Ayurveda and so forth,’—and ‘*nigamāḥ*’ as
‘the Nighaṇṭu and other works that help in the understanding of the
meanings of words’;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 71);—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(p. 132).

**(verses 4.19-20)**

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 246).—‘One shall teach the Veda, the
Purāṇas and the subsidiary sciences to the person who is equipped with
character, is of strong mind and is free from hypocrisy.’

*Dakṣa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 34).—‘The getting-up of the Veda, the
pondering over it, its continuous study, *Japa*, and imparting it to
pupils,—thus fivefold is *Vedic Study*.’

*Dakṣa* (p. 71).—‘For these reasons, one shall continuously study the
Veda.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.99).—‘He should acquire a knowledge of the meaning of
the Veda and also the various sciences.’

*Āpastamba* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 154).—‘If there is any science in
which he does not shine, that he should acquire by going to the teacher
again.’

*Āpastamba* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 154).—‘Śvetaketu has declared that
even after settling down in the house, the man shall reside for two
months in the year with the Teacher, seeking for further knowledge. This
however is forbidden by the scriptures.’

019	Let him daily pore over those Institutes of science which soon give increase of wisdom, those which teach the acquisition of wealth, those which are beneficial (for other worldly concerns), and likewise over the Nigamas which explain the Veda.
