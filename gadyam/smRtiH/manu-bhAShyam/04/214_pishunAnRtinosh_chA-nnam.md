<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Informer*,’—one who betrays the confidence reposed in him; or one who
talks ill of persons behind their back.

‘*Perjurer*,’—who has given false evidence.

‘*Seller of sacrifices*,’— who, having performed a sacrifice, sells its
fruit; *i.e*., says to another person,—‘May the fruit of this sacrifice
be yours,’ and receives a price for it. Though, in reality, there can be
no ‘selling’ of a sacrifice, yet, what is forbidden, is the food of a
person who makes such living, or who undertakes sacrifice with a view to
cheat others.

‘*Śailūṣa*’—is actor; or, according to others, he who exposes his wife
for the public. Another *Smṛti* is more specific—‘he who lives by
dancing.’

‘*Tailor*’—He who works with the needle,

‘*Ungrateful person*,’—he who nullities the good that has been done to
him; on the contrary, proceeds to do harm to his helper, and not to do a
good turn to him, even though capable of doing so.—(214)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
945);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 495), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Piśuna*’ is the back-biter,—‘*anṛtī*’ is the perjuror and such
others,—the person who makes over to another person the merit of a
sacrificial performance and receives money in return is called
‘*Kratuvikrayaka*’;—‘*śailūṣa*’ is one who makes a living by
dancing,—‘*tantuvāya*’ is one who lives by weaving cloth;—‘*kṛtaghna*’
is the person who does not acknowledge the good done to him;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 773);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 260), which
adds the following notes:—‘*Śailūṣa*’ is defined in the Adipurāṇa as ‘an
actor who is looking out for a living’,—‘*Tunnavāya*’ ‘one who works
with needles.’
