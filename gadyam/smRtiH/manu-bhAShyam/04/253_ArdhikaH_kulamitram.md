‘*Ardhika*,’ ‘*Ploughman*,’ is the man who ploughs his family-holdings
for him.

‘*Cowherd* and *slave*’—arc terms denoting relationship. One may eat
food of that person who keeps his cows for him.

‘*He who offers himself*;’—saying, ‘you are my sole refuge; I live
solely dependent upon you’—one who offers oneself in this manner, is
also one whose food may be eaten.—(253).
