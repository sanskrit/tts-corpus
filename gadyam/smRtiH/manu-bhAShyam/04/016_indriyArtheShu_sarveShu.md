‘*Sensual objects*.’— Objects of sense, colour, taste, and the rest; —
‘*to these he shall not become addicted*,’—*i.e*., he shall not attend
to them too much. Lovely young girls, sounds of flute and music, sweet
taste, perfumes of camphor and other things, loving touch,—all these one
shall not enjoy over much.

‘*Through desire*’—*i.e*., by reason of the predominating influence of
desire.

In regard to all these, one should keep one’s own enjoyment under proper
check; just in the same manner as one keeps one’s desire for wealth
under check, by. restricting one’s earning? only to what one gets
without begging.

‘*Excessive addiction to these*.’—This points out the method of
restraining one’s desires. Attachment to objects cannot be checked by
the mind; it can be checked by reflecting upon them as inimical to one’s
best interests. At first, one should not seek to obtain them; and when
they do come to one, and one has enjoyed them once, one should reflect
upon the following facts relating to them:—These are such that in a
moment they cease to be agreeable,—they are transient,—they are
forbidden by the scriptures,—attachment to them leads to hell, and so
forth. This is what has been already said under 2.96 above.—(16)

*Gautama* (9.50).—‘He shall not give much scope to the sexual organs,
the stomach, the hand, the feet, the speech and the eye.’

*Āpastamba* (2.5).—‘By controlling the activities of the mind, the
speech, the breath, the eye, the ear, the tactile organ, the sexual
organ,—he attains immortality.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.1).—‘Always using water, always wearing the sacred
thread, daily studying the Veda, avoiding the Śūdra’s food, approaching
his wife only during the *season*, offering oblations according to
rule,—the Brāhmaṇa falls not from the region of Brahman.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.122).—‘......Control of the senses......these are
conducive to the accomplishment of Dharma, for all men.’

016	Let him not, out of desire (for enjoyments), attach himself to any sensual pleasures, and let him carefully obviate an excessive attachment to them, by (reflecting on their worthlessness in) his heart.
