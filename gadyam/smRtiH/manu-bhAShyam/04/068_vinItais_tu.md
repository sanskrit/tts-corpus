Some people, in their audacity, do not make any attempt at training
animals. It is with a view to this that the Author adds this verse.

‘*Trained*’—well-broken.

‘*Fast*’—swift going.

‘*Equipped with signs*’—w ith such signs as auspicious hair-whorls, and
the like, and not with such unlucky marks as a bare forehead and the
like.

‘*Endowed with colour and form*’—‘*Colour*’ stands for the brightness of
the skin, etc., and ‘*form*’ for the shape of the limbs. The ‘goodness’
of these has to be ascertained with the help of treatises dealing with
the characterestics of animals, etc.

‘*Without striking much*’—not causing them pain, again and again ,—‘
*with the goad*;’ as being struck again and again with the hook, etc.,
they become perturbed and cause injury. (68)
