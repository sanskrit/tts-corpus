**एतैर्** विवादैः क्रियमाणैर् यः पापयोगो भवति, अकर्तुस् तेन न संबन्धः । **सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यत** इत्य् उच्यते । **एतैश् च जितैर्** उपेक्षितैः **सर्वांल् लोकाञ् जयति** स्वीकरोतीत्य् अर्थवादः ॥ ४.१८१ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The sin that accrues from such quarelling, does not accrue to him who
avoids them;—this is what is meant by the phrase, ‘*becomes freed from
all sins*.’

When these are ignored, he ‘*wins*’—makes his own—‘*all these worlds*.’

This is a purely commendatory exaggeration.’—(181).
