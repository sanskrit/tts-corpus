He shall never bathe in the tanks belonging to other persons. Having bathed there, he becomes tainted with a part of the tank-digger’s sin.—(201)

‘*Nipāna*,’— which is etymologically explained as ‘*nipibanti asmin*,’
or ‘*nipibanti asmāt*,’ — ‘in which, or from which, people drink,’—means
‘water-reservoir;’ that is, a tank, a well or a tank. And one should
never bathe in any such tank as has been dug by another man for his own
use, and has not been given away for the benefit of the public.

This forbids all kinds of bathing—(*a*) the obligatory daily bath, (*b*)
the occasional bath necessitated by the touch of the Cāṇḍāla and such
other persons, and (*c*) the ordinary bath taken for the relieving of
heat and perspiration.

The text proceeds to point out the evil arising from the disobedience of
the said prohibition he becomes ‘*tainted*’—contaminated—by a part of
such sin as there may be of the person who dug the tank.

This is a deprecatory exaggeration, supplementing the preceding
prohibition,—(201)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 169), which adds the
following notes:—In view of the term ‘*Nipānakartuḥ*’ in the second
line, the term ‘*Parakīya*’ should be taken to mean ‘made by another
person’; as *Kalpataru* holds that ‘*Parakīya*’ must mean ‘made by
another’,—whether consecrated or unconsecrated, since no distinction
between them is made anywhere;—\[This appears to be a gist of
Medhātithi’s explanation of ‘*Parakīya*,’ for which see *Translation*
\];—‘*Nipāna*’ means ‘water-reservoir.’

This verse is quoted also in *Kālaviveka* (p. 328), which too makes the
same observations as *Vīramitrodaya* (just quoted).

It is quoted also in *Aparārka* (p. 234), which makes the remark that
the tank that has been consecrated and made over to the public cannot be
called ‘*parakīya*’; and this favours Medhātithi’s interpretation of the
verse, which is supported also by what follows in the next verse;—in
*Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 65), which explains ‘*parakīya*’ as ‘dug by another,’
and says it cannot mean ‘belonging to another’; as is quite clear from
what is added regarding the *nipānakartṛ*;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
874);—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 300), which explains ‘*parakīya*’ as
‘dug by others’;—and is *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 324), which says that
‘*Kadācana*’ makes it clear that the prohibition is absolute.

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.5-6).—‘People should not perform their bath in water
that has been dammed; a part of the merit goes to the man that built the
dam. For this reason one should avoid the dams and wells built by
others.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.159).—‘He shall not bathe in the tanks of other persons
until he has taken out five clods of earth; he shall bathe in a river or
in ponds dug by the gods, in lakes, and in springs.’

*Viṣṇu* (63.1).—‘He shall not perform his bath in tanks belonging to
others.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 169).—‘One shall avoid the dams
and wells built by others; the builder becomes a partaker in the merit:
one should bathe there after throwing in three handfuls of earth (and
three jarfuls of water).’

201	Let him never bathe in tanks belonging to other men; if he bathes (in such a one), he is tainted by a portion of the guilt of him who made the tank.
