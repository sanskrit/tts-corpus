He shall say what is true; and he shall say what is agreeable; he shall not say what is true, but disagreeale; nor shall he say what is agreeable, but untrue; this is the eternal law.—(138)

In regard to what a man may be called upon to speak, he is restricted to
telling the truth. The ‘*true*’ is that which is in strict accordance
with what is seen and heard.

‘*He shall say what is agreeable*.’— This is a second injunction. It is
only right to describe the nobility and other good qualities of a
person, even without any purpose. Then again, it would be right to speak
to a person of the birth of his son—‘O Brāhmaṇa, a son has been born to
you’—if it were true; even though the speeker may not have any motive of
his own in conveying the information; if it is not known to him already.

What is ‘true’ may be ‘agreeable’ as well as ‘disagreeable.’ An example
of the ‘agreeable truth’ has been already shown, in the form of the
assertion, ‘O Brāhmaṇa, a son has been born to you.’ An example of the
‘disagreeable truth’ we have in the form of the assertion, ‘Your maiden
daughter is with child’. If this he *untrue*, it should not be spoken
of, of course; but even if it be true, the fact of a virgin being with
child is something that should not be spoken of. In such cases, if the
man can help it, he should remain silent.

People might be led to think that, even when the girl is pregnant, it
would be right to say, ‘she is not pregnant,’ as such an assertion would
he ‘agreeable;’—with a view to this, the Author has added—‘*He shall not
say what is agreeable, but untrue*;’ so that for the man who is the
first to notice the signs of pregnancy in the girl, it would not do to
remain silent.

‘*This is the eternal law*’— The Veda is eternal, hence the law laid
down in the Veda is also eternal.—(138)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 163) to the effect that only
such truth should be told as is agreeable; it quotes the words of Vyāsa
to the effect that ‘only such truth should be told as is beneficial to
living beings.’

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 523);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 14).

*Gautama* (9.68).—‘Devoted to truth and gentlemanly in his behaviour.’

*Viṣṇu* (71.73-4).—‘Not what is untrue;—nor what is disagreeable.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.132).—‘He shall never expose himself to danger; he
shall not, without reason, say what is disagreeable, nor what is not
beneficial or untrue; he shall not be a thief, nor an usurer.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 174).—‘Harsh words, calumny, hack-biting, lying,
useless talk, cruel words are the six defects of speech; also speaking
before a person of the defects of his country, family, caste, learning,
arts, appearance, conduct, character, dress, body, livelihood; words
productive of anger and fear, etc., etc.’

*Dukṣa* (Do., p. 175).—‘Lying, adultery, eating of forbidden food, etc.,
etc.’

*Yama* (Do., p. 176).—‘One should not either say or listen to wicked
words, specially in regard to Brāhmaṇas.’

138	Let him say what is true, let him say what is pleasing, let him utter no disagreeable truth, and let him utter no agreeable falsehood; that is the eternal law.
