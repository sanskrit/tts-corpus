<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The village, inhabited by many such persons as have committed sins of
varying grades of seriousness, is, by reason of their presence, called
‘unrighteous.’ In such a village he shall not dwell. The term
‘*village*’ stands for human dwelling-places; hence the prohibition
applies to cities also.

A marshy country abounds in sickness; in such a country, and in a
desert, which also abounds in sickness, he shall not dwell. He shall
also leave a country where by chance some epidemic might begin to rage.

^(‘)*Alone*’—without a companion—‘*he shall not undertake a
journey*.’—(60)

sacrificial fuel, kuśa-grass and garlands, which is inhabited by wealthy
persons, where idle men do not abound, where cultured people abound, and
which cannot be entered by robbers.’
