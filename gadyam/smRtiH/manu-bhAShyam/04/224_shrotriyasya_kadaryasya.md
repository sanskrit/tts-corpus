What is meant is the Brāhmaṇa endowed with all necessary
qualifications,—the term ‘Vedic Scholar’ being meant to be purely
illustrative. ‘*Vedic Scholar*’ means the learned man who performs all
the duties that have been laid down for him. If such a person happens to
be ‘*miserly*’—who does not take delight in receiving friends, relations
and guests, and who does not wish to give anything to any person.

The other person is the ‘*usurer*,’ living on usury, and thus engaged in
objectional business. If he happens to be ‘*liberal*,’ noble-minded,
endowed with faith, is delighted at the arrival of people at his house,
and duly honors them with food and other things.

The food belonging to these two persons the gods have ordained to be
‘*equal*.’

Even though one of them (the former) is possessed of all good qualities,
yet he is condemned by reason of his niggardliness. It has been declared
that ‘covetousness spoils all good qualities.’ The other person, even
though endowed with due faith, is censured by reason of his
objectionable business. Hence, ‘*having examined*’—duly pondered over
the matter—the gods have ordained that the food belonging to the two
persons stands on the same footing.—(224)

These verses are quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 508);—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 768).

They are referred to also in the Mahābhārata (12.264.11) as ‘*Brahmagītā

**(verses 4.224-225)  
**

*Baudhāyana* (1.5.63).—‘Having compared the food offered by a man pure
but devoid of faith, and that by one impure, but endowed with faith,—the
gods declared them to he equal. Prajāpati told them that the two were
not equal, hut unequal; what is offered by the faithless being damned,
that which is purified by faith is distinctly superior.’

*Mahābhārata* (Śānti., 270.10).—‘People learned in the ancient lore
recite certain verses sung by Brāhmaṇas:—In connection with the
sacrificial performance the gods regarded as similar the food offered by
the pure hut faithless man and that offered by the impure but faithful;
similarly also that offered by the miserly Vedic scholar and by the
generous woman,—having compared these two, they regarded them as equal.
Prajāpati however told them that they had committed a mistake; that
offered by the generous is purified by faith, while the other is damned
through want of faith.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.14).—‘One should eat the food offered even by the thief,
if he is endowed with faith; but never of that man who sacrifices for,
or initiates, many people.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 508).—‘Even food offered by one’s
teacher should not be eaten, if it is not offered with respect.’
