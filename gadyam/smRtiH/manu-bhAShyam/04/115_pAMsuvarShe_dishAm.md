**गोमयुः** शृगालः । तस्य **विरुतं** शब्दकरणम् । **श्वखरोष्ट्राणां** **पङ्क्त्यवस्थितानां** शब्दं कुर्वताम् अनध्यायः । एकैकस्य समानजातीयपङ्क्तौ ॥ ४.११५ ॥

‘*Gomāyu*’—is the jackal; the ‘howling’ of the jackal is its *crying*.

It is time unfit for study only when dogs, donkeys and camels are crying
together in large numbers; each of these three crying along with others
of the same species.—(115).

‘*Paṅktau*’—Buhler entirely misrepresents Kullūka; Kullūka does not
explain the term as ‘in a company’; he clearly explains that what is
meant is that ‘one shall not read the Veda when seated in a line with
horses, camels or asses’; while Medhātithi explains the meaning to be
that ‘that time is unfit for study when the animals named cry out in a
line

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 536);—in *Hemādri*
(Kāla, p. 774);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 163);—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 195).
