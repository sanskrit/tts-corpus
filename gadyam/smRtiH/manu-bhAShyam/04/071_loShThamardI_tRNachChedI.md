A man who crushes clods, cuts grass or bites his nails, quickly goes to perdition; so also the back-biter and the unclean man.—(71)

अस्माद् एव केवलाल् **लोष्ठ**ग्रहणात् पूर्वोक्तमृल्लोष्ठम् इति षष्ठीसमासो विज्ञायते । उभयप्राधान्ये हि मृद्ग्रहणं लोष्ठ इव अत्राकरिष्यत[^१५१] । तस्यैव हस्तेन सुमर्दत्वात् प्राप्तः पर्युदासः । सुधायास् तु काठिन्याद् यत्नसाध्यं मर्दनम्, तन् नैवासति प्रयोजने प्राप्तम् । मृल्लोष्ठमर्दनं तु हस्तेन पुरुषाणां स्वभावतः केषांचित् प्राप्नोति । तस्य पर्युदासः ।

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It is in view of the word ‘*loṣṭha*,’ ‘clod,’ being used here by itself
that the compound ‘*mṛlloṣṭha*’ of the preceding verse has been taken as
a *Tatpuruṣa* compound; for, if both ‘*mṛt*’ and ‘*loṣṭha*’ were meant
(and the compound were a *Dvandva* one) then, in the present verse also,
‘*mṛt*’ would have been mentioned in the same manner as ‘*loṣṭha*.’
Since clods are capable of being easily crushed, people are likely to do
it; hence it becomes necessary to forbid it. As for lime-mortar, its
crushing requires great effort, and hence people are not likely to do it
needlessly. As for the crushing of earth-clods, on the other hand, some
people are inclined, by their very nature, to do it; hence its
prohibition.

‘*Who cuts grass*’—as mentioned in the preceding verse.

‘*He who bites his nails*’—with his teeth.

‘*Sūcakaḥ*’—the informer, the back-biter; he who describes, behind his
back, the defects, real or unreal, of another person.

‘*Unclean*’—already explained.

‘*Quickly goes to perdition*.’—Other Vedic acts are uncertain regarding
the time at which their results appear; but the act here mentioned is
not so; its result appears ‘*quickly*’—in this very life—in the shape of
the loss of wealth, &c., which is what is meant here by ‘*perdition*.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 183),—and again on (p. 253), as
lending support to the idea that the man himself becomes ‘unclean’ by
dealing with ‘unclean things.’
