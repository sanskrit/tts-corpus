‘*Daṇḍa*,’ ‘rod,’ is that whereby one *is struck*, ‘*daṇḍyate*;’ that
is, the hand, the stick, the whip, the rope, the split-bamboo, and so
forth.—This ‘*rod*’ ‘*he shall not raise, when angry, against another
person*;’ *i.e*., he shall not hold it up; nor shall he let it fall
down; *i.e*., bring it into contact with the other person’s body.

The son and the pupil one may strike with the whip, the split-bamboo, or
the slap,—as is going to be mentioned under Discourse VIII,—but not with
the *stick*. Further, these two are to be beaten, not in auger, but only
*with a view to correction*,’—*i.e*., for the purpose of correcting
them, if through boyishness, they happen to misbehave. And these two are
to be punished lightly, as is going to be laid down under 8.299.

The ‘*pupil*’ is meant to exclude the male and female slaves also; the
purpose served (*i*. *e*., correction) being the same in both
cases—(164).

*Cf*. 8.298-299 and 4.175.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 231), which adds:—‘*Śiṣya*’ here
means ‘one who has to be taught—the ‘son’ is mentioned separately with a
view to emphasis;—and in support of this it quotes the rule of Viṣṇu,
which is in the general form ‘*Śāsyam śāset tāḍayet*’.

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 161.38).—(Same as Manu, but reading ‘*Tāḍanam
smṛtam*’ for ‘*tāḍayettu tam*’).

*Viṣṇu* (71.80.82).—‘He shall not raise the rod against another
person;—for disciplinary purposes, he shall beat his pupil, on the back,
either with a rope or a bamboo-piece.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.155).—‘He shall beat his son and his pupil.’

164	Let him, when angry, not raise a stick against another man, nor strike (anybody) except a son or a pupil; those two he may beat in order to correct them.
