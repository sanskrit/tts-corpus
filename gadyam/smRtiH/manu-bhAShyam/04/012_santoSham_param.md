**संतोष** आश्रयितव्यः, न बहूनाम् उपजीव्यः स्याम् इति याच्ञाक्लेश आस्थेयः । **सुखार्थी संयतो भवेत्** । संयमो यात्रिकाद् धनाद् अधिके नाभिलाषः । **संतोषो** मनस्विनां सुखमूलम् । **दुःखस्य मूलं विपर्ययः** असंतोषः । महद् विदुषां दैन्यम्, अभिलषिते वस्तुन्य् असंपत्तिः । तस्मात् **संतोषम्** आश्रयेत् ॥ ४.१२ ॥

With a view to laying stress upon the importance of the two means of
living—‘to collect grains for three days’ and ‘not to possess grains
enough for the morrow,’—the author adds this verse by way of reflection.

One should have recourse to contentment; that is, one should not make an
effort to go about begging on a large scale, with a view to becoming
dependent upon several persons.

‘*He who wants happiness should remain
self-controlled*.’—‘*Self-control*’ consists in not wanting more wealth
than what would suffice for bare subsistence.

‘Contentment’ is the root of happiness for all high-minded persons; and
its opposite—*i.e*., Discontent—is the root of unhappiness; the
non-accomplishment of what is desired being a source of great
humiliation for the learned. For these reasons, one should have recourse
to contentment.—(12)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 170), which remarks that in
connection with all these ‘*vratas*’, it has to be borne in mind that
what is exactly meant by the term ‘*vrata*’ is the *mental
determination* that ‘I shall do this—I shall not do that’,—and that all
these have to be taken up immediately after the Final Bath.

*Yājñavalkya* (1.129).—‘He shall ever remain contented.’

012	He who desires happiness must strive after a perfectly contented disposition and control himself; for happiness has contentment for its root, the root of unhappiness is the contrary (disposition).
