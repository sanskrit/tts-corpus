‘*Who* *acts resolutely*,’—*i. e*., he who is firm in his determination
to do something; having undertaken an act, he is sure to finish it;
having begun an act, he does not desist: *i.e*., who is not
undetermined. This is what is asserted in such passages as—‘going to the
end of what has been begun, etc., etc.’

‘*Gentle*’—not hard-hearted.

‘*Has no connection with men of cruel conduct*’—such as thieves and
others.

‘*By means o f self-control and liberality*, *he wins heaven*’— ‘*if he
sticks to this practice*;’—*i.e*., observing the said rules.

‘*Self-control*’ being mentioned separately, the term, ‘*dāntaḥ*,’
should he taken to mean ‘tolerant of opposition.’—(246)

246	He who is persevering, gentle, (and) patient, shuns the company of men of cruel conduct, and does no injury (to living creatures), gains, if he constantly lives in that manner, by controlling his organs and by liberality, heavenly bliss.
