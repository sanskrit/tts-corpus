<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

While lying upon his head, he should not place the fire-pan underneath
it. ‘*Upadhāra*’ means *placing*.

‘*Stepping over*’—passing along—after having jumped over it.

‘*Under his feet*;’—*ie*., he shall not place it in a place where he
might put his foot upon it.

‘*Anything* *dangerous to* *life*’—such as too laborious work, or
running with too much force, and so forth; these he should not do.—(54).
