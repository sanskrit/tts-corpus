आदिकर्मणि विधिम् इमं समाचरेत् । **आर्द्रपादो** भोजनम् आचरेत् । न चातृप्तेः पादौ संचन्न् आसीत । **संविशेत्**, शयने गात्राणि नावक्षिपेत् । संवेशनं शयने गात्रसंयोजनम् । अस्य फलम् आह- **दीर्घम् आयुर्** इति । नायम् आयुष्कामस्य विधिः, किं तर्हि पूर्ववन् नित्यः । आयुरनुवादस् त्व् अर्थवाद एव ॥ ४.७६ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Before the act of eating, one shall observe the rule that ‘one should
eat with wet feet;’ it is not meant that he should go on wetting his
feet till he has finished eating and become fully satisfied.

‘*Shall not deep*’—*i.e*., he shall not lay down his body upon the bed;
‘*samveśana*,’ ‘sleeping,’ standing for the *laying down of the body on
the bed*.

The reason for this is next mentioned—‘*Long life*.’—It does not mean
that the injunction is meant only for one who desires long life (and for
none others); in fact, like the preceding ones, this also is obligatory;
and the mention of ‘long life’ is purely illustrative.—(76)
