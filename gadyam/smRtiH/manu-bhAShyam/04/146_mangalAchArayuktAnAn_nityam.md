For those who are ever intent upon auspicious customs, who have their mind under control, and who go on reciting prayers and offering oblations,—there is no calamity.—(146)

**विनिपातः** प्राकृताशुभनिमित्तको दैवोपद्रवो व्याधिर् धननाश इष्टवियोगादिः । स एवम् आचाराणां माङ्गल्यकान् निवर्तते । अनेनापि नित्यतैवोक्ता भवति, सत्य् अपि फलार्थत्वे । न हि कश्चिद् दैवोपद्रवानिवृत्तिम् अर्थ्यते । अतो नित्यग्रहणम् अनुवादः । अथापि कश्चिद् अनर्थी स्यात् तथापि नित्य एवायं विधिः । एवं चोभयार्थता तस्य नित्याधिकारवृत्तिर् विनिपातनिवृत्तिश् च ॥ ४.१४६ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Calamity*’—supernatural troubles arising from natural portents,—such
as sickness, loss of wealth, separation from loved ones, and so forth.
All this is precluded from people who observe the auspicious customs.

This indicates the obligatory character of the acts, even though they
are done with a view to a definite end. No one ever actually seeks for
the cessation of supernatural troubles; hence, the term ‘*ever*’ is
purely reiterative; the meaning being that, even though there may be
some persons who may not seek it, yet the rule is entirely obligatory.
So that, by doing the act, the man fulfils two ends—he fulfils an
obligatory duty and also avoids calamity.—(146)

146	No calamity happens to those who eagerly follow auspicious customs and the rule of good conduct, to those who are always careful of purity, and to those who mutter (sacred texts) and offer burnt-oblations.
