<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Those things that are likely to obstruct Vedic study should all be
relinquished; such acts, for instance, as attending upon the palaces of
kings and ministers; as also the act of being overmuch addicted to
worldly Affairs, constantly thinking of earning more and more wealth by
means of money-lending and such other means, and thereby maintaining his
family, and obtaining a prosperous household teeming with male and
female slaves.

‘*This constitutes the accomplishment of his aims*’—*i.e*., of the
Accomplished Student. The fact that, carrying on his daily study of the
Veda, he maintains his family by some means or other, constitutes his
highest success in life,—(17)

017	Let him avoid all (means of acquiring) wealth which impede the study of the Veda; (let him maintain himself) anyhow, but study, because that (devotion to the Veda-study secures) the realisation of his aims.
