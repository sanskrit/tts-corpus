<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The term ‘*goṣṭha*,’ ‘*pen*’ signifies the dwelling-place; and it is a
different word from the compound \[ *go* + *sthā*, which means an *abode
of cows*, and with which, therefore, the word ‘*gavām*,’ ‘*of cows*,’
would be superfluous\].

‘*Brāhmaṇas*.’—Significance is meant to be attached to the plural
number. \[What is prescribed is to be done only when there are many
Brāhmaṇas present\].

‘*Hand*’ stands for the *arm*.

‘*Eating*.’—When he himself is eating.—(58).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 90), which
explains ‘*gavām goṣṭhe*’ as ‘*goviśisṭe goṣṭhe*’,—and ‘*dakṣiṇam etc*.’
as ‘he should place the upper cloth on his left shoulder and keep the
right one outside the cloth’;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 71).

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.58).—\[Reproduces Manu, reading ‘*madhye*’ for
‘*goṣṭhe*’\].

*Viṣṇu* (71.60).—‘He shall raise his right arm in the presence of fire,
gods and Brāhmaṇas.’

*Āpastamba* (Vīramitrodaya-Paribhāṣā, p. 90).—‘In a temple, at Śrāddhas,
in cow-pens, at sacrifices, near Brāhmaṇas, during the twilights, at
meeting saintly men, in the fire-house, at marriages, during
Vedic-study, during meals, one shall raise the right arm.’

*Mahābhārata* (12.193.20).—\[Same as Manu, the first line being read as
‘*Devāgāre gavūm madhye brāhmaṇānām kriyāpathe*.’\]
