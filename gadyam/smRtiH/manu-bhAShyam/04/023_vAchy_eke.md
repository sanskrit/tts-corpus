Some people constantly offer their life-breath into speech, and their speech into the life-breath,—knowing that in speech and in life-breath rests the imperishable fulfilment of sacrifices.—(23)

यदायं पुरुष उच्छ्वसिति तदैवम् अनेन ध्यातव्यम्- "वाचं प्राणे जुहोमि" इति । भाषमाणेन च "वाचि प्राणं जुहोमि" इति । एतावतैव पञ्चयज्ञा निर्वृत्ता भवन्ति । यदि नित्याः फलाय न वक्तव्याः । आत्मज्ञयाश् चात्राधिक्रियन्ते । विहितो ह्य् अयम् अर्थः पञ्चाग्न्युपासनायाम् उपनिषत्सु कौषीतकी ब्राह्मणे विस्तरेण (कौषु २.५) । **अक्षयं** फलतः अपुनरावृत्तिफलत्वात् ॥ ४.२३ ॥

Whenever a man breathes, he should think—‘I am offering speech into
Life-breath;’ and when he speaks, he should think—‘I am offering
Life-breath into Speech.’ By this alone the Five Sacrifices become
accomplished.

“If these are obligatory, they should not be spoken of as leading to any
results.”

As a matter of fact, only such persons are entitled to this form of
sacrifice as are cognisant of the real nature of the Soul.

This same fact has been laid down in the Upṇniṣads, in connection with
‘the worship of the Five Fires,’ and in great detail in the *Kauṣitaki
Brāhmaṇa*.

‘*Imperishable*’—in their results; their results consisting in
non-return to the cycle of birth and rebirth.—(23)

**(verses 4.23-24)  
**

*Kauṣītaki-Brāhmaṇa*.—‘While the man breathes, he does not speak; at
that time he offers speech unto breath; while he speaks, he does not
breathe; then ho offers breath unto speech; these two arc the endless
oblations, offered during sleep as also during waking hours;—other
oblations are an end; those that consist of acts. In this manner have
the Ancient Sages offered the Agnihotra-oblations.’

*Mahābhārata* (Bhagavadgītā, 6.25-333).—‘The Yogins have recourse to a
different sacrifice, the Daiva sacrifice; other Yogins have recourse to
another sacrifice offered into the fire of Brahman. Others again offer
the auditory and other organs into the fire of Restraint; others offer
sound and the other objects into the fire of the sense-organs. Others
offer all sense-functions and breath-functions into the fire of the Yoga
of self-restraint, enkindled by wisdom. Sages fixed in their observances
offer the sacrifice of substances, the sacrifice of austerities, the
sacrifice of Yoga, the sacrifice of Vedic Study and the sacrifice of
Knowledge. They offer the Prāṇa unto the Apāṇa, and the Apāṇa unto
Prāṇa; and restraining the function of Prāṇa and Apāṇa, devoted to
breath-control, restrained in their food, they offer Prāṇa unto the
Prāṇas. All these are persons well-versed in sacrifices and have their
sins destroyed by sacrifices. O Suppressor of enemies, the sacrifice of
knowledge is superior to the sacrifice of substances; all action, O
Pārtha, culminates in knowledge.’

023	Knowing that the (performance of the) sacrifice in their speech and their breath yields imperishable (rewards), some always offer their breath in their speech, and their speech in their breath.
