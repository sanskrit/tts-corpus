This is a recapitulation.

‘*Unfordable darkness*’—*i.e*., that which is crossed over with
difficulty.

‘*Darkness*’ stands for *suffering*. Even such ‘*unfordable darkness*’
becomes easily fordable with the aid of Merit as a companion; *i.e*.,
the man does not become submerged in the darkness.—(242)
