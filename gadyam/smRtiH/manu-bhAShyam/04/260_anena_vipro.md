This describes the result of all that has gone before.

‘*The Brāhmaṇa, learned in the Vedic scriptures, who conducts himself by
this course of life, has his sins*’—arising from doing what is
forbidden—‘*removed*’—by means of Expiatory Rites. The meaning is that
by doing what is enjoined, and by avoiding what is forbidden, and by
expiating by means of rites those sins that may happen to be
committed,—‘*becomes exalted in the region of Brahman*;— or, according
to another theory, be becomes of the same nature as Brahman—(260)

Thus ends Discourse IV.

*Gautama* (9.71).—‘The Accomplished Student who maintains this behaviour
saves from sin his parents and relations both above and below himself,
and fails not in attaining the regions of Brahman.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (8.17).—‘Ever bathing, ever wearing the sacred thread, ever
studying the Veda, avoiding the food of outcasts, approaching his wife
only during the periods, and offering oblations according to law, the
Brāhmaṇa fails not to reach the regions of Brahman.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.4.24).—‘The Brāhmaṇa who every day, during the day and
the night and the twilights offers prayers, becomes purified by Brahman
and becomes Brahman Itself; and following the scriptures, he wins the
regions of Brahman.’



*End of Adhyāya IV*.

260	A Brahmana who, being learned in the lore of the Vedas, conducts himself in this manner and daily destroys his sins, will be exalted in Brahman's world.
