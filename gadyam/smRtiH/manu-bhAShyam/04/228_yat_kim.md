When asked, he should give something, without showing any displeasure. Because he may turn out to be a worthy recipient who will save him from everything.—(228)

‘*Something*’—however little—shall be given by one who is ‘*asked*,’
begged. If there is some doubt,—and no certainty—as to the person being
a worthy or unworthy recipient, some little thing, not much, should be
given. The idea, that much shall not be given, is due to a direct
assertion to that effect, in connection with doubtful cases.

It is just possible that the man may turn out to be a worthy
recipient;—What sort of recipient?—‘*One who will save him from*’—guard
him against—‘*everything*’—all kinds of Sin that lead men to hell.

It has been said under 3.96 that gifts are to be offered to ‘one who
knows the Veda and its meaning;’ and to that the present verse is an
exception, providing for small gifts being offered in cases of doubtful
worthiness of the recipient.—(228)

*Yājñavalkya* (1.203).—(See above.)

*Dakṣa* (3.30),—‘If one asks him for charity for the sake of obviating
some trouble or for the maintenance of his family,—he shall give what is
asked for, after due investigation. Such is the law relating to all
gifts.’

228	If he is asked, let him always give something, be it ever so little, without grudging; for a worthy recipient will (perhaps) be found who saves him from all (guilt).
