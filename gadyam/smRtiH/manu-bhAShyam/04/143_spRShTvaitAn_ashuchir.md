अविशेषवचने ऽपि **प्राणाश्** चक्षुरादय एव मूर्धन्या उच्यन्ते । प्राणशब्दश् चक्षुरादिवचनो वेदे प्राणसंभव उपनिषदि दृश्यते । **गात्राणि** अंसजानुपादादीनि । **पाणितलेना**पो गृहीत्वा स्पृशेत् ॥ ४.१४३ ॥

Though the text uses the general term ‘sense-organs,’ yet what are meant
are the eyes and the other organs located in the head. The term
‘*prāṇa*’ is found to be used in the sense of *sense-organs* in the
Veda, where, in the *Upaniṣads*, the origin of sense-organs has been
described.

‘*Limbs*’—ankles, knees, feet, and so forth.

‘*With the palm*’ he shall take up water and then touch the organs
&c.—(143)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p, 231), which explains that the
term *prāṇa* here indicates the holes in the head, which form the loci
of the ‘breaths’,—the term ‘*gātra*’ indicates the chest, the head and
the shoulders, the touching whereof has been described as
purificatory;—and adds that the ‘touching’ here laid down is for the
purposes of purification.

It is also quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.155) as laying down the
purificatory act to be done after water-sipping;—and in
*Nityācāropaddhati* (p. 36), as laying down the expiation for looking by
chance at the things mentioned.

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.16.14).—‘On dreaming, or sneezing, or
touching a horse, or blood or hairs, or fire or cows or Brāhmaṇas or a
woman; or on going over a long journey, or on touching an unclean thing,
or a man unawares, or on wearing the loin-cloth,—he shall touch water.’
