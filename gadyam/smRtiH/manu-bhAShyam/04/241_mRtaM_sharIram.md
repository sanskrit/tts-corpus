**(verses 4.241-242)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 173.13).—‘People leave the dead body like a
log of wood or a clod of earth; having used it for a while, they turn
their backs upon it and go away. Therefore, O king, it is Righteousness
alone that one should serve for the purpose of obtaining a real helper.
By being equipped with Righteousness one reaches the highest celestial
state; similarly equipped with unrighteousness, he fails into hell.’
