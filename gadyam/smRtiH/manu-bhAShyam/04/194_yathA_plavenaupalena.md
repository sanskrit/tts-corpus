Just as a man crossing water by means of a stone-raft sinks down, so also sink downwards the ignorant giver and receiver.—(194)

‘*Aupala*,’—made of stone.

‘*Raft*’— boat and such other contrivances used in crossing water.

He who ‘*crosses*’—proceeds to cross—water by such a raft, sinks down
into the water. So also do ‘*the ignorant giver and receiver*.’

The term, ‘*pratīcchaka*’ is to be explained as ‘*pratīcchām karoti*’
(with the *ṇich* affix), and then the nominal ‘*ṇvul*’ added to it.

‘*Pratīpsakaḥ*’ is another reading; this would be derived from the root
‘*āp,’ to obtain*, with the derivative affix, and then the nominal
‘*ṇvul*’ added to it. The meaning of both would be the same.—(194)

194	As he who (attempts to) cross water in a boat of stone sinks (to the bottom), even so an ignorant donor and an ignorant donee sink low.
