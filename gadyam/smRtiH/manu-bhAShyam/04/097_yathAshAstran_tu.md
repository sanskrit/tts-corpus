**उत्सर्गं कृत्वा** द्वे अहनी रात्रिम् इयन्तं नाधीयीत । **तद् अहर्निशम्** । द्वितीयं चाहर् एव न रात्रिर् इत्य् एतावन्तं कालं **विरमेन्** नाधीयीत । उभयतोहःपक्षा रात्रिः **पक्षिणी** । 

- <u>यद् वा</u> यस्मिन्न् अहन्य् उत्सर्गः कृतस् तद् अहः सैव च रात्रिः अनध्याये । द्वितीयस्मिन्न् अहन्य् अध्येतव्यम् । आद्ये तु पक्षे द्वितीयम् अहर् अनध्यायो रात्रौ त्व् अध्ययनम् उच्यते ॥ ४.९७ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Having perfomed the ‘Utsarga’-rite, he shall not read the Veda for two
days and one night; *i.e*. during *^(‘)that same day and night*,’ and
during the next *day* only (not the *night*). During this time, ‘*he
shall cease’—i.e*., not read the Veda.

The night, along with the preceding and the following days, is called
‘*the night with its two wings*.’

Or, the day on which the ‘Utsarga’ rite has been performed, that day and
the same night are ‘holidays;’ and on the next day the study should be
resumed.

According to the former explanation, the next day is an ‘holiday,’ and
study is to be resumed on the second night.’—(97)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 187) to the effect that after
*Upākarma* and *Utsarjana*, one should observe a holiday of either one
day or three days;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.143);—in *Smṛtichandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 154), which says that this verse, along with verse 119,
lays down three alternatives—(1) ‘*Pakṣiṇī rātri*’, *i.e*., one night
with a day preceding, and another following it,—(2) three days
(mentioned in verse 119) and (3) one day—the alternative to be adopted
being determined by one’s own *Gṛhyasūtra*;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 761),
which adds the same note;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 58).
