‘*Vidyut*’— lightning;—‘*stanita*’—thunder. The copulative compound
indicates that it is ‘time unfit for study’ only when all these appear
simultaneously.

‘*Meteor*’—is the name given to the light emanating from the stars that
fall from the sky;—‘*the promiscuous falling*’ of these is their falling
here and there.

The term ‘*ākālikam*’ stands for the time beginning from the occurrences
mentioned and ending with the same time on the following day.

The name of Manu has been, mentioned for the purpose of filling up the
verse. Others have explained this to mean that an option is meant.—(103)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 529), which
explains it as—‘From the time of the phenomenon to the same time next
day, it is unfit for study in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 834), which also gives
the same explanation of ‘*ākālikam*’;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 443),
which explains ‘*eteṣu*’ as referring to ‘*vidyut*’ and the rest, and
notes that ‘*ākālikam*’ goes with each of them;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p.
761), which has the same note and explains ‘*ākālikam*’ as beginning
from the time of the phenomenon and extending up to the same time of the
next day;—and adds that in seasons other than the rains, the ‘holiday’
is to be observed in the evening;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p.
194);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*, (p. 57), which adds the following notes:—all
the three phenomena are to be taken collectively here, on account of the
copulative compound—says Medhātithi; according to Hemādri, each is to be
taken separately; what is said here refers to the rainy season;
‘*ākālikam*’ means ‘from the time of the occurrence to the same time on
the morrow’; ‘Lightning and the rest’ are to be treated as ‘occasions of
holiday’ only when they occur either in the morning or in the
evening;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 149), which takes each of
the three phenomena separately, and has the same notes as above.
