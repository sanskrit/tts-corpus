<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When a heifer—either his own or some-body’s—is drinking water or milk,
he shall not prevent her; nor shall he tell of it to another person.

This rule refers to the time before milking. During milking, it has been
enjoined that the flow of milk is to be accelarated (by keeping the calf
near, and preventing it from sucking).

The feminine gender (in ‘*dhāyantim*’) implies that there is no harm in
preventing a male calf from sucking.

‘*Rainbow*’;—that which is called ‘*Śakradhanuṣ*’ and ‘*Vijñanacchāyā*’
in Kaśmir. ‘*In the sky*;’—this is a needless reiteration. But some
people have explained that this has been added for the purpose of
indicating that there is no harm in seeing and showing the rainbow when
it appears over a mountain.—(59)

059	Let him not interrupt a cow who is suckling (her calf), nor tell anybody of it. A wise man, if he sees a rainbow in the sky, must not point it out to anybody.
