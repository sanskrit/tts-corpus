**निर्घात** आन्तरिक्ष उत्पातध्वनिः । **ज्योतिषां** चन्द्रादित्यगुरुप्रभृतीनाम् **उपसर्जनं** परिवेषणम् इतरेतरपीडनं च । **ऋताव् अपि** । अपिग्रहणं वर्षासु किल नोत्पाता गण्यन्त इत्यभिप्रायेण ॥ ४.१०५ ॥

‘*Preternatural sound*’— an ominous sound emanating from the sky.

‘*Of planets*’—Moon, Sun, Jupiter, and the rest.

‘*Impact*’—*i.e*., a halo round them, or mutual contact.

‘*Even during the season*.’—‘Even’ has been added with a view to the
fact that portents are not regarded as such, during the rains.—(105).

‘*Jyotiṣāñcopasarjane*’—‘When there is a halo round the planets, and
when they strike each other’ (Medhātithi);—‘when there is an eclipse’
(Nārāyaṇa, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 188), which explains ‘*ṛtau*’ as
‘during the raniny season’, and ‘*ākālikān*’ as ‘during the time of the
phenomenon’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 530), which explains
‘*Nirghāta*’ as ‘sound in the sky’, and ‘*Jyotiṣāmupasarjanam*’ as ‘halo
round the sun or the moon’, or ‘the falling of meteors’;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 151) which explains ‘*Nirghāta*’ as ‘a
peculiar sound in the sky’, and ‘*Jyotiṣāmupasarjanam*’ as ‘the
appearance of a halo round the Sun or the Moon’;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 194).

earthquake or eclipse.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.22).—‘The full-moon day, the moonless day, the Aṣṭakā
