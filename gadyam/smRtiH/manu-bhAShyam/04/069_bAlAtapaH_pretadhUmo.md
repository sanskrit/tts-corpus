The young sun and the smoke from the dead body, should be avoided, as also a broken seat. He shall not cut his nails and hair, nob shall he tear his nails with his teeth.—(69)

For three ‘*muhūrtas*’ after rising, the sun is called the ‘young sun,’

‘*Smoke from the dead body*’—that which rises from a dead body being
burnt.

‘*Broken seat*’—*i.e*., that which is torn, or with holes, or injured.
All this should be avoided.

‘*He* *shall not cut his nails and hair*’—himself; when they have grown
too long, he should get them cut by the barber.

He should not tear his nails—even though they may have become very
long—with his teeth.

Others construe as follows:—‘He shall not cut bis nails and hair with
his teeth,—aud the nails he shall not cut even with his teeth.’

Young women often tear their nails, in the process of adorning,
them.—(69)

‘*Bālātapaḥ*’—The morning sun’ (Medhātithi);—‘the Sun in the sign of
Virgo, *i.e*., the autumnal Sun’ (Rāghavānanda).

‘*Na chindyānnakharomāni*’—‘He should not clip his nails or
hair,’—‘himself, *i.e*., he should employ a barber’ (Medhātithi and
Govindarāja),—‘before they have grown long’ (Kullūka),—‘except at the
proper time for dipping’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 183);—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 71), which explains ‘*Bālātapa*’ as the ‘autumnal Sun’ \[‘*Bāla*’
standing for the zodiacal sign of *Kanyā*, Virgo, and it is during the
month of *Kārtika* that the *Sun* (*ātapa*) is in that sign\].

069	The morning sun, the smoke rising from a (burning) corpse, and a broken seat must be avoided. Let him not clip his nails or hair, and not tear his nails with his teeth.
