<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The first verse sums up in brief what has gone in the last two
discourses, for the purpose of recalling it to the mind; and the second
verse serves to indicate that among the Duties of the Householder this
prescribes the means of livelihood.

Inasmuch as the extent of ‘life’ of man is uncertain, any rule regarding
the ‘quarter’ of life becomes incompatible; hence the present verse is
to be taken as stating only the period of life that has been allocated
to the various stages of life. Though the rule might somehow be
justified on the basis of the assertion that ‘man lives for a hundred
years,’ yet our Author has himself laid down other kinds of limit;
*e.g*., with regard to studentship he has said that ‘it may extend till
the Veda has been got up’ (3. 1); and in connection with the limit of
the stage of the Householder also, it has been said (6. 2)—‘when the
Householder finds etc.;’ and from all this it follows that the present
verse is to be taken simply as the reiteration of the said limits.

‘*The first quarter of his life*.’—This is regarded as ‘first,’ counting
from the man’s birth.

‘*Having dwelt with his Teacher*,’—*i.e*., having accomplished his
studentship;—‘*during the second quarter of his life*,’—he shall marry,
and ‘*live in his house*’;—*i.e*., lead the life of the Householder.—(1)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 562), which adds
that the rule here laid down is on the basis of the understanding that
the ordinary span of man’s life is a hundred years;—and in
*Saṃskāramayūkha*, (p. 64), which remarks that the span of man’s life
being a hundred years, one should devote twenty-five years to each of
the four life—stages,—such is the view of the writers of the Digests.

*Mahābhārata* (12.242.28-30).—‘The pupil shall pass through the
life-stages, free from vulgarity; having gone through the fourth part of
his life by keeping the fasts and observances, relating to the Veda, he
shall offer the fee to his preceptor and perform the ceremony of
‘Return’ according to the law; being united to a virtuous wife and
having, with due care, kindled the fires, the householder shall pass the
second quarter of his life, keeping firm in his observances.’

Do. (12.243.1).—‘During the second quarter of his life, the householder
shall live in the house, firm in his observances, after having been
united to a virtuous wife and having kindled the fires.’
