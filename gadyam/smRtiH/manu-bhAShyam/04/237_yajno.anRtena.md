This is supplementary to the foregoing Prohibition. By reason of
‘falsehood,’ ‘*the sacrifice trickles away*’—*i e*., becomes fruitless;
the purpose for which it was performed is not accomplished. Similarly,
throughout the verse.—(237)

237	By falsehood a sacrifice becomes vain, by self-complacency (the reward for) austerities is lost, longevity by speaking evil of Brahmanas, and (the reward of) a gift by boasting.
