The fourth ‘*muhūrta*’ of the night is ‘*midnight*,’ which is also
called ‘*mahāniśā*,’ ‘Deep Night.’ Two ‘*muhūrtas*’ before, and two
‘*muhūrtas*’ after this ‘midnight,’ it is unfit for study.

‘*In water*;’—*i.e*., while standing in a river or tank or some such
reservoir of water. Since the context is dealing with

‘Vedic study,’ the repeating of Vedic texts—such as ‘*Aghamarṣana*,’ and
the rest—in water is not forbidden.

Some people read ‘*udaye*’ for ‘*udake*;’ which means that it is unfit
for study when the sun has just risen.

‘*Unclean*;’—*i.e*., while he has not washed, after having taken his
food. One is also called ‘unclean’ before one has washed, after having
evacuated the bladder or the bowels. Some people explain that the term
‘*unclean*’ stands for all those impure conditions that require washing;
so that spitting also would become included.

‘*Even in his mind*.’—This does not mean that on other occasions unfit
for study, the *thinking* of Vedic texts is permitted; all that it means
is that the conditions here mentioned are more serious than the
rest.—(109)

*Gautama* (16.11, 12, 18, 34, 46).—‘On evacuating the bladder and the
bowels;—at midnight, during the twilights and in water;—in the
cremation-ground, in the outskirts of the village, on the public
thorough fare and during impurities.—One day and night is to be regarded
as unfit for study on the completion of the Veda, or vomitting, or
eating at Śrāddha and at sacrifices to men. According to some people, in
the city it is always unfit for study.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.26, 30).—‘On accepting a gift in honour of the Piṭrs,
and on eating at Śrāddha, the rest of the day is unfit for study. At
birth and at death, there is to be no study, oven in the mind.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (1.10.26).—‘After dining at night.’

*Āpastamba* (11.17, 25, 26).—‘While immersed in water;—when there is
lightning, when it is thundering, or after eating at Śrāddha, during a
fog, they forbid even mental study.’

*Do*. (32.12).—‘During the night, there is to be no teaching except
moral teaching to the pupils.’

*Viṣṇu* (30.16).—‘Not in water.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.149).—‘In an unclean place, or when one is unclean,
during lightning and thunder, after eating while the hands are still
wet, in water, at midnight, or when very high winds are blowing.’

*Pāraskara* (2.11.2, 4).—‘On eating at Śrāddha, on the falling of
meteors, on earthquake, at fiery portents, at the junction of two
seasons,—there should be no study till the next day; after meals while
the hands are wet, in water, or midnight, during the two twilights,
while a dead body is lying in the village, and while a Caṇḍāla is in the
village.’
