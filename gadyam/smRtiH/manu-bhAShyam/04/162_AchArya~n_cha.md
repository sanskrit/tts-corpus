‘*Preceptor*’—who initiated him.

‘*Teacher*’—who taught him, and explained to him (the Veda).

‘*Elder*’—other than the aforesaid two; *i.e*., the paternal uncle, the
maternal uncle, and so forth.

‘*Any persons performinq austerities*.’—The term ‘any’ has been added
with a view to include those sinners also who may be engaged in the
performance of Expiatory Rites.

In various places, the injuring of *all* living beings has been
forbidden: and some people think that the repetition of the same in the
present text is meant to forbid the injuring of even such Preceptors and
Teachers, etc., as may be great sinners and dangerous enemies; and that
what is stated in 8.350 regarding the propriety of striking ‘the
teacher, or the boy, or the old man,’ etc., is only a counter-exception
to what is forbidden in the present verse.

Our Teacher, however, says as follows:—The present verse is not a
‘prohibition,’ it is of the nature of ‘preclusion;’ and it is meant to
prescribe the determination (not to injure the persons, just like the
text—‘he shall not look at the rising sun,’ etc. Hence, the mere act of
injury having already gone before, the present may be taken as
forbidding even the *idea* of injuring the persons mentioned.

Or, the term ‘*hiṃsā*,’ ‘injury,’ may be taken to mean ‘the saying of
disagreeable words;’ in view of such expressions as ‘he *struck* her
with words.’

Or, the root ‘*hanti*’ (in ‘hiṃsa’) may he taken as used in the sense of
*acting against*.—(162).

‘*Hiṃsyāt*’—‘Strike, or talk in an offensive manner, or act against’
(Medhātithi);—‘act against’ (Kullūka);—‘injure’ (Govindarāja).

‘*Tapasvinaḥ*’—‘All persons engaged in austerities, including those
engaged in expiatory penances’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘ascetics’
(Nandana and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 223);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.21),
in the sense that no injury should be inflicted upon the persons
mentioned, even though they attack one with murderous intent;—in
*Vyāvahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 118);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyāvahāra, p.
7a), which explains the meaning to be that the persons mentioned should
not be killed, even if they turn out to be ‘*ātatāyin*’, ‘dangerous
criminal’.
