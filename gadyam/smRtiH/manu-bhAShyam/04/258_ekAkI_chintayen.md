The renunciation of all acts having been accomplished, the following is
his special duty:—

‘*Alone*,’— without a companion,—having no one to talk to—‘*in
solitude*’— in a place where there is no one, and which is free from all
disturbance,—‘*he shall meditate upon what is good for himself*’;
*i.e*., should practise that ‘contemplation of the Brahman’ which has
been enjoined in the *Upaniṣads*.

By means of this practice and meditation, he obtains the highest
good—called ‘Liberation.’—(258)
