Any śrāddha-gift, be it animate or inanimate, if the Brāhmaṇa accepts, it becomes an occasion unfit for study; because the Brāhmaṇa has been declared as having the hand for his mouth.—(117)

श्राद्धनिमित्तं दीयमानं भक्तादि **श्राद्धिकम्** इति प्रसिद्धम्, तन्निवृत्त्यर्थम् इदम् उच्यते । न केवलं व्रीहितण्डुलादिप्रतिग्रह एव श्राद्धे ऽनध्यायहेतुः । यावद् अन्यद् अपि **प्राणि व्**आ गवादि तथा **अप्राणि** वासोयुगादि । **तद् अप्य् आलभ्य** प्रतिग्रहकाले हस्तेन स्पृष्ट्वा नाधीयीत । यतस् तद् एव तस्य भोजनम् । पाणिर् एवास्यम् अस्येति **पाण्यास्यः** । श्राद्धे भोजनं तन्निमित्तं च द्रव्यग्रहणं तुल्यम् इति दर्शयति ॥ ४.११७ ॥

The rice and other things that are given in connection with *Śrāddhas*
are generally known as ‘*śrāddhika*,’ ‘*śrāddha-gift*;’ and it is with a
view to show that, in the present context it is not this alone that is
meant, that the present verse is added; the sense being—it is not only
the acceptance of *Vrīhi*, Rice and other grains that makes the occasion
unfit for study; but other things, also—be they ‘*animate*’—in the shape
of the cow and other animals—‘*or inaminate*’ in the shape of pairs of
cloth, etc,.—having accepted such a thing,—*i.e*., after having touched
it with his hand, at the time of acceptance—the man shall not study.
Because the act itself constitutes the act of ‘eating.’ ‘*Pāṇyāsya*’ is
one whose hand is his mouth. What this means is the eating at a
*śrāddha* and accepting gifts in connection with it—both stand on the
same footing.—(117)

*Gautama* (16.48-49).—‘For those partaking in the Śrāddha till the same
time next day; also when there is some connection with Śrāddha performed
with uncooked food.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (13.7).—‘Fruits, water, sesamum, foods and other things
connected with the Śrāddha,—on the acceptance of all this, it becomes
unfit for study, the Brāhmaṇas having been declared to have their hands
for their mouth.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.26-30).—‘By accepting gifts and eating at the
Śrāddha, the rest of the day becomes unfit for study;—after eating, till
digestion; the Brāhmaṇa has his hands for his mouth. In this connection
they cite the following:—There is no difference between what is eaten
and what is received in gift.’

117	Be it an animal or a thing inanimate, whatever be the (gift) at a Sraddha, let him not, having just accepted it, recite the Veda; for the hand of a Brahmana is his mouth.
