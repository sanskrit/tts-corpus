नित्यताम् एव समर्थयते अकरणदोषदर्शनेन । **नवेन** सस्येन **अनर्चिता** अकृतहोमा **अग्नयो** ऽस्याहिताग्नेः **प्राणान् एवात्तुम् इच्छन्ति** भक्षयितुम् । **गर्धिनः** गर्धं अभिलाषातिशयः, तद् अस्यास्तीति मत्वर्थीय इनिः ॥ ४.२८ ॥

By pointing out the evils arising from the omission of the said rites,
the text indicates their obligatory character.

‘*Not worshipped with new grains*’—not having the oblations offered into
them,—‘*the fires*’—of the man who has set up the fire,—‘*seek to
devour*’—eat—‘*his very life*.’

‘*Greed*.’— ‘Greed’ is excessive *longing*; and one who has this, is
called ‘greedy.’ The affix ‘*ini*’ has the force of the possessive.—(28)
