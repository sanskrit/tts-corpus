This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.143), to the effect that
during the rest of the year, one should study the Veda during the bright
fortnights and the Subsidiary Sciences during the dark fortnights;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 95), to the effect that the ‘dismissal’ involved in
the *Utsarjana* ceremony does not mean that its study should be totally
abandoned during the rest of the year;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 298)
as laying down the method of study to be adopted after *Utsarjana*;—and
in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 148).

carry on the study of the Subsidiary Sciences.’
