एकम् अनुदिश्य आमश्राद्धम्, तस्य यावच् छ्राद्धकृतौ[^१९४] गन्धलेपौ तिष्ठतस् तावद् अनध्यायः । पूर्वस्माद् विधौ विध्यन्तरम् । द्वितीयस्मिन्न् अहनि कृतस्नानो ऽपनीततद्गन्धो ऽध्ययनार्हः । उपलक्षणं चैतद् असतोर् अपि गन्धलेपयोर् यावद् भुक्तम् अन्नं न जीर्णं तावन् नाधीयीत । **विदुष** इति तस्यैव श्राद्धभोजनाधिकारम् अनुवदति ॥ ४.१११ ॥

‘*That which is not offered to his own ancestor*;’—*i.e*., that at which
uncooked food is offered;—while of such a rite the ‘*odour and stain
remain*,’ so long he is unfit for study. This is a rule different from
the forgoing rule. When on the next day, the man has bathed, and the
odour has disappeared, he becomes fit for study.

What is said here is only by way of an iṇḍicatipn. Even while the ‘odour
and stain’ are not actually there, the man shall hot study, until the
food eaten has become digested.

The epithet ‘*learned*’ reiterates the rule that it is only the learned
Brāhmaṇa that is entitled to eat at funeral rites.—(111).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 190), where ‘*ekānudiṣṭa*’ is
explained as the ‘*Ekoddiṣṭa Śrāddha*’;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 756),
which explains ‘*gandha*’ etc. as ‘the odour of the sandal-paint and the
incense’;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 195).
