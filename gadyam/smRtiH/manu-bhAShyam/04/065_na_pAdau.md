He should not wash his feet in a vessel of white brass.

In a broken vessel—even in one that may be broken in a single place;—the
use of one that is broken all over would be forbidden by its very
nature. In the case of cups, etc., made of leaves, however, since these
are never regarded as ‘broken vessels,’ there would be no harm in using
them, even though they may have holes.

‘*Bhāva*’ is feeling in mind; that vessel with which the mind does not
feel satisfied; or that which is defiled by name—such as ‘*patadgraha*,’
‘spittoon,’ and the like, in the case of these latter also, the mind
does not feel satisfied.—(65)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 328), which adds that the
prohibition regarding the ‘broken vessel’ applies to vessels of metal
*other than copper and the like*;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 71);—and in
*Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 839).
