<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Mad*’—even though suffering from the darts of passion.

‘*Courses*’—stands for the blood that appears every month in the woman.
When this is visible, he shall not approach her. Nor shall he sleep on
the same bed with her.

It may be argued that—‘the prohibition put forward is already implied in
the aforesaid prohibtion of touching a woman in her courses.’

But what the present text contains is not a prohibition) but the
injunction of a positive observance. And there is a difference in the
expiatory rite prescribed in connection with the omission of this
observance.—(40)
