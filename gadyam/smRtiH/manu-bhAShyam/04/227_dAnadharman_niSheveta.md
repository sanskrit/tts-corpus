‘*Charity* and *Righteousness*’—in the form of tanks, etc; the compound
being construed as a Copulative one. Or, it may.be explained as ‘the
duty of *charity*;’ the mention of duty indicating the necessity of
maintaining a cheerful disposition.

‘*Bhāvena*’—with the heart; ‘*parituṣṭena*’—cheerful, happy—‘*If he
finds a suitable recipient*’, he shall offer gifts in connection with
the observances that he keeps, as also in connection with the acts that
he does outside the sacrificial altar.—(227)

*Viṣṇu* (12.32).—‘Whatever is the most desired object in the world and
whatever is most dearly loved in the house,—that should be given to a
person with proper qualifications, by one who is desirous of obtaining
imperishable rewards.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.201, 203).—‘Cows, land and food should be given by one
who desires his own welfare, to a proper recipient with due honours; but
never to an unfit recipient.—Day by day one should make gifts to proper
recipients; and more specially on special occasions; and whenever any
one begs of him, he should give with due respect what is asked for, to
the best of his ability.’

*Agnipurāṇa* (quoted in Parāśaramādhava, p. 165).—‘If a man’s wealth is
not used either in charity, or in enjoyment, or in acquiring fame, or in
acquiring spiritual merit,—that wealth is absolutely useless. Therefore,
after having acquired wealth, either through fate or by his own efforts,
he should make gifts to the twice-born, but never advertise them.’

*Ādityapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 164).—‘In the three worlds nothing
is held superior to charity.’
