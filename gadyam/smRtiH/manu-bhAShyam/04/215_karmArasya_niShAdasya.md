dancer and the singer (who have been separately mentioned);—or the
curious person who visits every kind of stage.

sword and the like, or unwrought iron.—(215)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
945);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*

(Āhnika, p. 495), which adds the following notes:—‘*Karmāra*’ is the
iron-smith,—‘*niṣāda*’ is a particular mixed caste,—‘*raṅgāvatāraka*’
persons, other than the dancer and the singer, who help in the stage;
or, as Medhātithi says, one who, through curiosity, visits each and
every stage;—‘*suvarṇakartā*’ is one who alters gold,—‘*Vaiṇa*’ is the
person living by piercing bamboos, or, as Medhātithi says, one who makes
a living by making bamboo-flutes;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 773);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 260), which explains ‘*niṣāda*’ as ‘an inversely
mixed caste—‘*raṅgāvatāraka*’ as ‘one who helps, in a subordinate
capacity, at theatrical performances by singing or dancing’,—‘*veṇa*’,
one who deals in articles made of bamboo.
