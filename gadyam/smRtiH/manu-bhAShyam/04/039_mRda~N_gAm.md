This rule applies to cases where, when a man has started to go, the said
things happen to come in his way. He should go in such a manner
that-they remain to his right. Another *Smṛti* has laid down, in
connection with depatures, that—‘he should walk round rightwards.’

‘*Deity*’—as painted on scrolls, for purposes of worshipping. Gautama
has declared that—‘One shall pass round the temples of gods leaving them
on his right;’ and, on the strength of popular opinion, the term
‘*deity*’ of the text is to be taken as standing for the temples
containing images of the Four-armed *Viṣṇu*, the Sun and other gods;—and
the same should be done with sacrificial houses also, as the author is
going to declare later on.

‘*Madhu*’—should be taken here as standing for *Honey*, on the strength
of its being mentioned along with ‘clarified batter;’ also because it is
mentioned in the middle of a number of auspicious things.

‘*Well-known* *trees*’— Large trees, well known for their great utility
and size, or, for the large produce of flower and fruits; such trees,
for instance, as the *Udumbara*, and the like. ‘The Udumbara is vigour
itself,’ says a Vedic description.

Some people have explained ‘*well known*’ as ‘of superior quality.’ But
these people, have no support for this, except certain popular notions;
and they should be ignored.—(39)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 176), which explains that the
‘mud’ meant is that *which has been dug out*;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (on
1.133).

*Gautama* (9.66).—‘A praiseworthy object, an auspicious object, a
temple, a cross-way and such objects,—he shall go round in such a manner
as to leave them on his right.’

*Viṣṇu* (63.26-30).—‘He shall go round the cross-ways in such a manner
as to leave them to his right; also a place where deities are being
worshipped; also well-known trees; also the fire, the Brāhmaṇa, the
courtesan, full water-jar, the mirror, the umbrella, the flag, the
banner, the *Bel-* tree and river-whirlpools; also the fan, the
*cāmara*, the horse, the elephant, the cow, curd, milk, honey and fried
grains.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.133).—‘The deity, the cow, the Brāhmaṇa and the
trees,—he shall pass by in such a manner as to leave them to his right.’

*Mārkaṇḍeya* (Aparārka, p. 176).—‘The road-crossing, and the important
trees he shall salute; and he shall pass by all auspicious objects in
such a way as to leave them to his right.’
