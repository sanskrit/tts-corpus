**भूर् गौश् च तनुं** शरीरम् **ओषतो** दहतः । **हिरण्यम् आयुर्** विभक्तिपरिणामः ओषतीतिकर्तव्यः । एवम् **अश्वश् चक्षुर्** इत्यादिषु क्रियापदानुषङ्गः कर्तव्यः ॥ ४.१८९ ॥

Land and Cow ‘*destroy*’—burn—‘*the body*.’

In the case of the expression, ‘*hiraṇyam āyuḥ*,’ the form of the verb
‘*oṣataḥ*’ has to be changed into the singular form. Similar changes
have to be made in connection with the other expressions—‘*aśvaḥ
cakṣuḥ*,’ and the rest.—(189)

189	Gold and food destroy his longevity, land and a cow his body, a horse his eye (sight), a garment his skin, clarified butter his energy, sesamum-grains his offspring.
