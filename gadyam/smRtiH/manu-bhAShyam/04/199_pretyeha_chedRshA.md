Such Brāhmaṇas are condemned after death, and also here (in this life) by the expounders of the Veda; and penance done under a false pretence goes to the evil spirits.—(199)

इह पदार्थस्वाभाव्येनान्योद्देशेनापि कृतं यत् फलं ततो भवत्य् एव । तथा हि गुरुनियोगे प्रवृत्तो धर्मोद्देशेन गुरुवचनं करोमीति न कामहेतोः । अर्थस्वाभाव्यात्[^२५५] तु कामं प्रतिजनयति ।

- एवं कश्चिन् मन्यते- "व्रतानि पापापनोदार्थानि । तानि अन्योद्देशेनापि क्रियमाणानि न स्वभावं जहति । एवम् एतन् मम प्रायश्चित्तम् उभयार्थं भविष्यति । लोके तपस्वीति ख्यातो भविष्यामि । पापं चपनोत्स्यते" । तस्यैवं बुद्धिमतो निवृत्त्यर्थम् इदम् आरभ्यते । 

- तदैतद् **व्रतं छद्मना चरितम्** अनुष्ठितं **रक्षांसि गच्छति** निष्फलं भवति न पापम् अपनुदतीत्य् अर्थः । न केवलं कार्याकरणं भवति याद्वद् **ईदृशा विप्रा** व्रतचारिणो **गर्ह्यन्ते** निन्द्यन्ते **ब्रह्मवादिभिः** वेदप्रमाणज्ञैः शिष्टैः ॥ ४.१९९ ॥

The nature of things is such that, even though an act may be done with a
view to a certain end, yet its other results also accrue to him. For
instance, when one is intent upon obeying one’s Teacher, it is with a
view to the fulfilment of a religious duty, and not for obtaining
pleasure; and yet, from the very nature of the thing, the act of
obedience brings pleasure.

Some people bold the following opinion:—“Penances serve the purpose of
removing sins; and even though performed with a view to other ends, they
do not renounce their own nature. So that, in the case in question, the
Expiatory Rite would serve both purposes,—I shall become known by the
people as *righteous*, and my sin also shall be removed.”

It is with a view to setting aside such a view that the Author adds the
present verse.

‘*The penance done under a false pretence goes to evil spirits*;’—that
is, it becomes useless, and it does not remove the sin.

It is not only that his purpose is not accomplished, in fact, such
Brāhmaṇas—those performing penances under false pretences—‘*are
condemned*’—reprehended—‘*by the expounders of the Veda*;’ *i.e*., by
the cultured people, who know the authority of the Veda.—(199).

199	Such Brahmanas are reprehended after death and in this (life) by those who expound the Veda, and a vow, performed under a false pretence, goes to the Rakshasas.
