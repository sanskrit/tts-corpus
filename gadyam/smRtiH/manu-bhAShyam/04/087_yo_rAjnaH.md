<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is an exaggerated deprecation of receiving gifts from Kings.

‘*Avaricious*’—who is in the habit of extracting riches from his
subsidiary chiefs.

‘*Who behaves contrary to the scriptures*’—he who acts against the laws
laid down under 11-2 *2 et. seq*., and inflicts undue punishments,
confiscates the women, and so forth.

‘*In succession*’—*i.e*., he goes to another hell after having
experienced the sufferings of one.

‘*Hell*.’—This term signifies *extreme suffering*; and, since *extreme
suffering* is all that is meant to be expressed, the singular number
would be the proper form; and the number ‘*twenty-one*’ is an
exaggerated description.—(87)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 185);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(pp. 403 and 410), to the effect that one should not accept gifts from a
*Kṣatriya* king who is unrighteous.

**(verses 4.87-91)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (43.1-22).—‘The Hells are as follows—

1.  Tāmisra,
2.  Andhatāmisra,
3.  Raurava,
4.  Mahāraurava,
5.  Kālasūtra,
6.  Mahāmaraka,
7.  Sañjīvana,
8.  Avīci,
9.  Tāpana,
10. Sampratāpana,
11. Saṅghātaka,
12. Kākola,
13. Kuḍmala,
14. Pūtimṛttika,
15. Lohaśaṅku,
16. Ṛcīṣa,
17. Viṣamapathin,
18. Kaṇṭakaśālmali,
19. Dīnapadī,
20. Asipatravana,
21. Lohacāraka.’

*Skandapurāṇa* (quoted in Parāśaramādhava, p. 199).—‘The man who has
been brought up on gifts from the king becomes a Brahmarākṣasa in the
water-less desert, and docs not obtain another birth. The man who,
having renounced his Brāhmaṇahood, and deluded by greed for riches and
for sensual objects, accepts gifts from the king, his fall into the
Raurava hell is certain. Even trees burnt by forest-fíres grow again on
the advent of rain; but those that have been burnt by gifts from the
king never grow again.’
