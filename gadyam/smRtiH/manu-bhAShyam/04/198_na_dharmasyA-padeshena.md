**पापं क्र्त्वा व्रतं** प्रायश्चित्तं न कुर्यात्, **धर्मस्यापदेशेन** धर्मम् अपदिश्य लोके ख्यापयति- "धर्मार्थम् अहं व्रतं करोमि, न मे प्रायश्चित्तनिमित्तम् अस्ति" इति परमार्थतस् तु प्रायश्चित्तार्थम् एव करोति । एवं न कर्तव्यम् । **पापं प्रच्छाद्या**पह्नुत्य तेन व्रतेन **स्त्रीशूद्रदम्भनं** न कुर्यात् । प्रकटं प्रायश्चित्तं कर्तव्यम् अन्यत्र रहस्यात् ॥ ४.१९८ ॥

‘*Having committed a sin, he shall not perform a penance*,’—in the shape
of an expiatory rite;—‘*under the pretext of doing a righteous
act*;’—pretending righteousness, he makes it known among people that he
is doing the penance purely as a religious act., and that there has been
no occasion for his doing it as an expiatory rite; though, in reality,
he is doing it as an expiatory rite. This is what one should not do.

‘*By covering sin*,’—by concealing his sin—one shall not—by means of the
said righteous act—seek to deceive ‘*women and Śūdras*.’

The meaning is that, when one has to perforin an expiatory rite, one
shall openly perform it as such, except in the case of the Expiatory
Rites distinctly laid down as ‘secret’—(198).
