वेदमुलत्वात् स्मृतीनां **वेदोदितम्** इति श्रूयते । **स्वकं कर्म** वक्ष्यमाणो व्रतसमूहः । विहितत्वात् **स्वकम्** इत्य् उच्यते । **नित्यं कुर्यात्** यावज्जीवम् । **अतन्द्रितः** अनलसः । एतद् व्रतधारणं **कुर्वन् यथाशक्ति** । अनेन सत्यां शक्तौ यथासंभवम् अनुष्ठानम् आह । तद् उक्तम्- "मनसा वा तत्समग्रम् आचारम् अनुपालयन्" (ग्ध् ९.६७) । **परमां गतिं** ब्रह्मत्वप्राप्तिरूपाम् ॥ ४.१४ ॥

‘*Prescribed in the Veda*.’—This is said in view of the fact that the
Smṛtis are all based upon the Veda.

‘*His own duty*.’—Consisting of the host of observances going to be
described. Being prescribed for him, they are called ‘*his own*.’

‘*Should always perform*.’—*i e*., as long as he lives.

‘*Without sloth*’—*i.e*., free from laziness.

By doing this—*i.e*., by keeping the observances,—‘*to the best of his
ability*;’—this implies that one is to perform just what he has the
strength to perform. It is in view of this that it has been declared
that—‘one may also observe all this mentally only.’

‘*Highest state*’—*i.e*., attainment of Brahman.—(14)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 217), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Nitya*’ here stands for all that is done without any desire for
personal gain’;—‘*paramā gatiḥ*’ means ‘deliverance’;—what is meant is
that what leads to Deliverance is the performance of duty along with the
true knowledge of the Supreme Self.

The verse is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 52),—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 48).
