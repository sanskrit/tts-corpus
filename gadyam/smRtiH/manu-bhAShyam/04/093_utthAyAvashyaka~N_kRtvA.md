When the night has passed and the dawn appeared, he should leave his
bed.

‘*Necessities of nature*.’— Evacuating of the bladder and of the bowels.
As a rule, people do this act at that time; hence the evacuating has
been called a ‘necessity.’

‘*Purifications*;’—*i.e*., brushing of the teeth, &c.; having done all
this; this is what is meant by ‘performing the purifications;’—*i.e*.,
having washed and cleansed himself, according to the rules laid down in
5.136.

‘*With* *a* *collected mind*;’—*i.e*., withdrawing his mind from all
other thoughts.

‘*He shall stand during the morning twilight,—repeating—the Sāvitrī*;—he
shall fix his mind upon the god Sun—‘*for* *a long time*.’

The time of ‘twilight’ has been described as extending up to the
appearance of the Sun; and even longer than this, one shall go on
repeating the *Sāvitrī*, if he desire longevity. It is for the adding of
this prolongation that the afore mentioned Injunction regarding the
Twilight Prayers (See 2.101) has been reiterated. ‘*Also during the
evening twilight,—at its proper time*;’—*i.e*., beginning from sunset
and prolonging it till after the appearance of the stars—(93)

093	When he has risen, has relieved the necessities of nature and carefully purified himself, let him stand during the morning twilight, muttering for a long time (the Gayatri), and at the proper time (he must similarly perform) the evening (devotion).
