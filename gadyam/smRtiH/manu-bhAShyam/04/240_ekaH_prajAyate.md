Alone is a creature born, and alone does it cease to be; alone it enjoys its good deeds and also its evil deeds.—(239)

यथा **जन्तुः** प्राणी, **एक एव जायते** न सुहृद्बान्धवादिना सह, **एक**[^२८९] **एव प्रलीयते**, न सुहृदो बान्धवाः सहमरणम् अनुभवन्ति । यदि नाम भार्यान्यो वा भक्तो जनस् तन्मरणकाल आत्मानं हन्यात् तथापि पृथग् एवासौ मरणक्रिया । अनया न गर्भैक्यम् अत्रिवद् अनुभवन्ति । एवं सुकृतदुष्कृते अपि पृथग् एवानुभवन्ति ।

- <u>ननु</u> च "न पुत्रदारम्" (म्ध् ४.२३९) इत्य् उक्तम् । यावता पुत्रः श्राद्धादिक्रियया पितुर् उपकरोत्य् एव मृतस्य, एवं भार्यापि ।

- <u>सत्यम्</u> । धार्मिकस्यैव तादृशः पुत्रो भवतीति तत्परम् एतत् । यथा जीवतः कस्यचिद् धस्तग्राहिकया कश्चित् सहायो भवति, एवं मृतस्य पुत्रो धर्मद्वारेणैवोपकरोति ॥ ४.२४० ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Each creature*’—living being—‘*is born alone*,’—and not along with his
friends and relations; and ‘*alone does it cease* *to be*;’ friends and
relations do not die with him. Even when one’s wife, or some other
devoted person, kills herself at the time of one’s death, this act of
*dying* is different from that of the man’s own dying; and, by this act,
the wife does not become born in the same womb with the husband, in the
way in which Atri was born.

Similarly, his good and evil deeds also the man enjoys himself.

“It has been said that neither one’s wife nor one’s sons help him; hut,
as a matter of fact, the son does help the father, by performing the
*śrāddha* and other rites; and so the wife also.”

True; but all that this mentis is that such a dutiful son is horn only
to a person who has acquired merit; and, just as during life, one is
helped by another person who supports him by the hand, so also, when the
man dies, his son helps him by means of religious acts.—(240)
