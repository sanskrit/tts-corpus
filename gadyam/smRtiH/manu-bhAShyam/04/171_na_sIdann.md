**धर्मः** शास्त्रमर्यादा । तेन वर्तमानः **सीदन्न् अप्य्** अवसादम् अपि प्राप्नुवन् **नाधर्मे मनो निवेशयेत्** । यत **अधार्मिका** यद्य् अपि चौर्योत्कोचदम्भादिभिर् धनसमृद्धा दृश्यन्ते, तथापि तेषाम् **आशु विपर्ययो** दृश्यते धननाशादिः । अतो न धर्माद् विचलेत् ॥ ४.१७१ ॥

‘*Dharma*,’ ‘Right,’ consists in the bounds of propriety laid down in
the scriptures;—one who acts according to this,—even though he may
‘suffer’ failure—‘*shall not turn his mind towards unrighteousness*.’
Because, even though unrighteous men may be found to have become rich by
wealth acquired by bribery, hypocrisy, and the like,—yet very soon their
‘*overthrow*’—in the form of destruction of their wealth, etc.—is found
to come about. Consequently, one should never deviate from the right.

The Author has, in a friendly spirit, shown us a visible instance.—(171)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 68), which adds
the following explanation:—‘*Sīdan*’, even though one may be in
difficulties regarding necessary expenses,—‘*adharmeṇa*’, by improper
appropriation of what belongs to others,—‘*adharmikāṇām*’, of those who
do not perform the prescribed duties,—‘*pāpānām*,’ of those who do what
is forbidden,—‘*viparyayam*,’ loss of wealth and other things,—‘*āśu*’
lias been added only with a view to emphasise, as calamity is actually
found to overtake sinners *after the lapse of some time also*.
