This is supplementry to the prohibition of Injury in general.

‘*Unrighteousness*’ consists in doing acts forbidden by the scriptures,
such as incest, and the like; and the man who does such acts is
‘*unrighteous*.’

‘*He whose wealth is mis-begotten*,’—*i.e*., he who acquires wealth in
the form of bribes offered for telling lies at legal proceedings, etc.

‘*He who is addicted to injuring*,’—he who always seeks to injure
others, either through enmity, or for fulfilling some other purpose.

Such a man does not obtain happiness in this world.—(170).
