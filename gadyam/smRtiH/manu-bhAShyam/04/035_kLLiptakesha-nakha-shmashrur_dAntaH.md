‘*Clipping*.’—This clipping, or ‘shaving of the lips’—is necessary. By
this the man becomes ‘*pure*,’ as the text says. If a man wear long
hair, bathing becomes a difficult process, and the man is likely to be
lazy on that account: and would thus remain ‘impure.’ If, however, even
though wearing long hair, he is careful about his bath, then the wearing
of hair would not be objectionable.

‘*Subdued*’—free from haughtiness.

‘*Pure*’— in all matters; and also purified by the right use of such
means of cleanliness as clay, water, mouth-rinsing, and so forth.

He should be always engaged in the study of the Veda. Though this has
been already said before, yet it is repeated again and again, in order
to show its great importance.

‘*What is conducive to his welfare*.;’—*i.e*., the avoiding of illness
by remedies, and also by guarding against indigestion, untimely meals,
heavy and hot food, and so forth.—(35).

*Gautama* (9.4-7).—‘He shall not wear cloth that is loudly coloured, or
that has been worn by another; nor garlands or shoes; in the event of
incapacity, he may wear washed clothes; he should never grow his beard,
without cause.’

*Gautama* (69).—‘He shall teach those that are disciplined,—himself
disciplined in cleanliness, and ever alert in regard to the Veda.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.131).—‘Wearing white clothes, with hair, beard and
nails clipped,—he shall not eat in the presence of his wife, nor with
only one cloth, nor standing.’

*Āpastamba* (1.30.10-12).—‘In his clothing, he shall avoid all
colouring; also what is naturally black. He shall wear only such cloth
as may not be obtrusive.’
