‘*Oven*’—a structure of bricks, for the depositing of fire.
‘*Mountain*’—here stands for forests and gardens; as the mountain-top is
going to be specifically forbidden (in the next verse). If the word were
really meant to stand for the mountain itself, and the prohibition
applied to the mountain as a whole, then people living on the mountains
would have to go without passing urine at all.

‘*Ant-hill*’—the mound of earth set up by insects.—(46)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 179);—in *Vīramitrodaya*,
(Āhnika, p. 33), which explains ‘*cityām*’ as the *Śyena* and other
altars built of bricks, or ‘at a place where a dead body has been
cremated’ (according to some); and in connection with ‘dilapidated
temples’ it remarks that, inasmuch as the making of water in *all kinds*
of temples is expressly forbidden, the addition of the epithet
‘dilapidated’, ‘*jīrṇa*’, must be understood to have been added with a
view to the perceptible physical danger involved in the act,—*i*. *e*.,
of loose bricks and other things falling and the like;—‘*Valmīka*’ is
‘the mound of mud collected by a particular kind of insect’

This verse is quoted also in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 329);—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 153);—and in *Nityācārapradīpa*, (p. 250),
which explains ‘*cityām*’ as ‘On a fire-altar.’
