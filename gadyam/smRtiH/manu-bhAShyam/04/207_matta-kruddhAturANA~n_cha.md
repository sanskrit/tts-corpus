The food offered by such persons is to be avoided, so long as the
intoxication and other conditions are actually on them.

Others explain the text to refer to habit; the sense being that one
should avoid the food offered by such persons as are frequently
drunk,—who are habitual drunkards.

Similarly, with one who has bad temper and is frequently obssessed by
rage; or one who is mostly sick, a confirmed invalid.

‘*What is contaminated by*’—spoilt by the touch of—‘*hair and insect*.’
Among insects, there are some which contaminate the food by their
presence when they are dead; *e.g*., flies and lizards; while others
spoil it even when living.

The term ‘*insect*’ includes all small creatures, such as worms, flies,
etc. And ‘*hair*’ includes nails and bristles, as also dirt and other
things;—on the basis of usage.

‘*What is touched with the foot intentionally*;’—there is no harm if it
is touched simply through chance carelessness—(207).

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3. 290);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 944);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 494),
which explains ‘*mattaḥ*’ as ‘intoxicated, either by wine or by wealth
etc.’—and ‘*āturaḥ*’ as ‘afflicted with a very serious disease.’

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 451), which explains
‘*Keśakītāvapanna*’ as ‘defiled by the presence of hair or insects’;—and
‘*Kāmataḥ*’ as ‘intentionally’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 517),
which adds that since the text has added the qualification ‘*Kāmataḥ*’,
there should be no harm if the food happens to be touched by the foot
*unintentionally*;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 610 and 770);—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 296);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 260), which
explains ‘*Keśakītāvapannam*’ as ‘cooked along with hairs or insects’.
