After unknowingly eating the food of any one of these, there should be a three days’ fast. Having eaten it knowingly, as also on eating semen, ordure and urine, one should perform the “Kṛcchra” penance.—(222)

     M G J: bhuktvācaret; but Medh's commentary clearly takes the term to be caret and not ācaret.

‘*Three days fast*;’—*i.e*., he shall not eat anything for three days.

‘*Unknowingly*,’—not intentionally.

In the case of its being done *intentionnlly*, one should perform the
‘*Kṛcchra*’ penance. And this *^(‘)Kṛcchra*’ should be the
‘*Tapta-kṛcchra*,’ in view of what other Smṛti texts have laid down. One
such text (Gautama 23.2) has prescribed the ‘*Tapta-kṛcchra*’ as to be
performed in the case of eating semen; ordure and urine;—*viz*., ‘In the
event of drinking these intentionally, one shall live upon milk, butter,
water and air—upon each of these for three days; this is the
*Taptātikṛcchra*; and then follows his purification,’

The present being not a section dealing with Expiatory Rites, the
mention of such a rite is meant to indicate the seriousness of the
offence.

In view of the phrase, ‘*of any one of these*,’ being in the Genitive
form, some people have held that the Expiatory Rite here prescribed is
meant to apply to only those cases where the food actually belongs to
the persons mentioned, and *not* where it is objectionable by reason of
time, or by its very nature, or by contact. Among such articles of food
as sour-gruel and the like, non-eatability is of four kinds:—(1) some
things are non-eatable, because of time ; *e.g*., sour-gruel, things
kept overnight, and so forth; (2) some are non-eatable, because of
contact; *e.g*, things that have come in contact with wine and such
things; (3) some are non-eatble by their very nature; *e.g*., garlic and
such things; (4) some are non-eatable by reason of their owner; *e.g*.,
the food of the persons enumerated in the present context.

Our answer to the above is as follows:—It is quite true that there are
four kinds of *non-eatability*; it is true also that the text has used
the Genitive form; but if the Expiatory Rite here prescribed did not
pertain to such food as *sour gruel* and the like, but only to what is
objectionable in regard to its owner, then the mention of these in the
present connection would be entirely meaningless. For the prohibition of
these two things is coining under Discourse V. From this it is clear
that their mention in the present context is only for the purpose of
prescribing the Expiatory Rite.

“Why, then, should they he mentioned in Discourse V.?”

This we shall explain at that place. As for the exact meaning and
purpose of such texts as—(*a*) ‘the eating of the first two is
objectionable’ and (*b*) ‘having eaten the food of persons whose food
should not he eaten,’ *etc*. (11.152),—we shall explain all this in
detail under those same texts—(222).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 240), which adds that the term
‘*kṛcchra*’ here stands for the ‘*atikṛcchra*,’ on the strength of a
text quoted from Śaṅkha;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 300),
which adds that what is prescribed in the first half is to be done only
in the event of the man being unable to throw out the food eaten; and
again on p. 305;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 542);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(pp. 252, 261 and 524).

*Gautama* (23.23.24).—‘If one eats food of the man whose food should not
be eaten, he should reduce himself to a condition when there is nothing
in his bowels;—he should not eat anything for three days.’

*Prajāpati*—‘On eating the food of one whose food should not be eaten
one should give to the Brāhmaṇa the price of that food; he should remain
with wet clothes throughout the day, or he should give a cow.’

222	If he has unwittingly eaten the food of one of those, (he must) fast for three days; if he has eaten it intentionally, or (has swallowed) semen, ordure, or urine, he must perform a Krikkhra penance.
