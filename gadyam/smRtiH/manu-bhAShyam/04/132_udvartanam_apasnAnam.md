‘*Unguent-powder*,’—such powder, etc., as are used for removing dirt
from the body.

‘*Used water*’—water that has been used for bathing, etc.

‘*Spittings*.’—Even apart from the mucus, in which form spittings are
generally thrown out; such things, for instance, as the betel-leaf and
other things, of which the juices have been eaten up and the tasteless
substance is thrown out.

‘*Standing upon*’ means *stepping upon*.

‘*Intentionally*.’—There is no harm if it is done unintentionally.—(132)

‘*Apasnānam*’—‘Water that has been used already’ (Medhātithi);—‘water
used for washing a corpse’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse has been quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 183);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 576), which explains ‘*apasnānam*’ as ‘water that drops
from the body when one is bathing,’—‘*niṣṭhyūtam*’ as ‘spittings’;—and
in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 321).
