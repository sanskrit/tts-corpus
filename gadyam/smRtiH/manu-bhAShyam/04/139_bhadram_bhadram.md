The first ‘*bhadra*’ (well) they have explained as with the negative
particle understood; the sense being—‘what is not well, he shall call
*well*.’

The particle ‘*iti*’ (after ‘*bhadran*’) is meant to be indicative; the
meaning being that “one shall make use of such agreeable words as
‘*Kalyāṇam*’ (welfare), ‘*maṅyalam*’ (auspicious), ‘*siddhan*’
(accomplished), ‘*śreyaḥ*’ (good), and so forth.

If we regard the first term ‘*bhadran*’ also as indicative of like
words, the meaning would be—‘If a man is blind, he should be spoken of
as *with eyes*; if he is illiterate, he should be spoken as *learned*’
and so forth.

Or, in all these cases, ‘*he shall simply say “well*.”’

‘*Needless enmity*.’—When there is no monetary or other interest
involved, he shall not make use of words in a mere bravado.

Similarly, he shall not create dispute in the king’s court. The epithet
‘*needless*’ applies to this also.

‘*With any one*’—*i.e*., even with a weaker party.—(139)
