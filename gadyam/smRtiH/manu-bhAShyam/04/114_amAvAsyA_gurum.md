पूर्वस्यार्थवादो नित्यार्थः । तेन यत्र नित्यत्वज्ञापकं न किंचित् स विकल्पते ऽनध्यायः । वक्ष्यति च "द्वाव् एव वर्जयेन् नित्यम्" (म्ध् ४.१२७) इति । **ताः परिवर्जयेद्** अध्ययनक्रियातः ॥ ४.११३ ॥

This a commendatory supplement to the foregoing rule, and it is meant to
show its obligatory character. Hence, in cases where there is nothing to
indicate the obligatory character of the rule, the treating of the
occasion as unfit for study is meant to be optional. The Author himself
is going to add (in 127 below)—‘he shall always avoid two only.’

‘*These he shall avoid*’—for purposes of Vedic study.—(114).

This verse is quoted in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 441), which explains
‘*Brahma*’ as ‘Veda’;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 755);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 53), which adds that this holiday lasts the whole day and night;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 152), which adds the same note;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 195).

*Bodhāyana* (1.11.40).—‘Here they cite the following,—“The eighth of the
month destroys the Teacher, the fourteenth destroys the pupil, the
fifteenth destroys the science; hence one should avoid reading at these
junctures.”’

*Viṣṇu* (30.29.30).—‘What is read on the day unit for study brings no
reward either in this world or in the other; by study on those days, I
here is diminution of the life-span of the teacher and also of the
pupil.’

114	The new-moon day destroys the teacher, the fourteenth (day) the pupil, the eighth and the full-moon days (destroy all remembrance of) the Veda; let him therefore avoid (reading on) those (days).
