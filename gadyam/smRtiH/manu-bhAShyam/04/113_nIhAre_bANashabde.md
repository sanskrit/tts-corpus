‘*Fog*’—when it is too dark to know the directions properly; it is also
called ‘*dhūmikā*;’ during which the atmosphere appears as if covered
with vapour and dust.

‘*Sound* *of* *arrows*’—whizzing of arrows.

Some people read ‘*vāṇa*,’ in which case, *vāṇa* stands for the *Lute*;
the use of this is met with in connection with the ‘*Mahāvrata*’-Rite.
The Lute has a hundred strings, and it is also without strings.

‘On the fourteenth day’—of each fortnight.

‘*Eighth day*’—all the eighth days; as is clear from other Smṛti texts,
as also from usage.

Others read ‘*aṣṭamīṣu*’ (for ‘*aṣṭakāsu*’).—(113).

This verse is quoted in ‘*Gadādharapaddhati*’ (Kāla, p. 195);—in
*Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 769), which explains ‘*nīhāra*’ as ‘fog’;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 53), which notes that this holiday is to continue
the whole day and night;—in *Smṛtichandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 159).
