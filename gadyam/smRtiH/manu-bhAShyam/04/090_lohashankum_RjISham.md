**(verses 4.88-90)  
**

“A varied list is found in Yājñavalkya 3.222 *et. seq*., Viṣṇu 43.1 *et.
seq*. Others occur in our text, 4.81, 4.197, 3.249, 12.76”.—Hopkins.

Nārāyaṇa takes ‘*nadī*’ as standing for the *Vaitariṇī* river; while
Govindarāja takes it as by itsef forming the name of a particular hell.
The *Viṣṇupurāṇa* has a hell named ‘*Dīpanadī*’.

All these three verses are quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 185);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 15), which adds the following explanation of the
names:—

1.  ‘*Tāmisra*,’ darkness,
2.  ‘*Andhatāmisra*’, dense darkness,—
3.  ‘*Mahāraurava-Raurava*’, abounding in hot sands,—
4.  ‘*Kālasūtra*,’ resembling the potter’s cutting string,—
5.  ‘*Mahānaraka*’, where all sorts of dire sufferings are gone
    through,—
6.  ‘*Sañjīvanam*’, where one is repeatedly killed and brought to life,—
7.  ‘*Mahāvīci*’, where large waves tumble about,—
8.  ‘*Tapana*’, resembling flaming fire,—
9.  ‘*Sampratāpana*’ is another name for the *Kumbhīpāka*,—
10. ‘*Saṃhāta*’ over-crowded,—
11. ‘*Kākola*’, where people are devoured by crows,—
12. ‘*Kuḍmala*,’ where there is whipping with cords,—
13. ‘*Pūtimṛttikam*’ where the earth smells like filth,—
14. ‘*Lauhaśaṅku*’, pricks like the needle,—
15. ‘*Ṛjīṣa*’, where rotten flour is thrown,—
16. ‘*Panthā*’, where one is constantly on the move,—
17. ‘*Śālmala*’, where people are pierced by thorns of the Śālmalī
    tree,—
18. ‘*Nadī*’, where one is washed away by such streams as the Vaitariṇī
    and the like—
19. ‘*Lohacāraka*,’ where there is chaining in irons.
