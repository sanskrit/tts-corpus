**अधर्मेण** प्रभुद्रोहादिना **एधते** वृद्धिं लभते । **तावत्** तस्मिन्न् एव काले । ततो धनं ग्रामं वा प्राप्य, **ततो भद्राणि** बहुभृत्यगवाश्वादि संपत्तिलक्षणानि **पश्यत्य्** अनुभवति । **ततः सपत्नान्** अरीन् दरिद्राञ् **जयति** परिभवति । तर्हि धर्मे स्थितान् कुतश्चन कुसृतिहीना लभन्ते । अतस् तेषां दारिद्र्यशब्द ऐश्वर्ये परिभवः । **समूलं** च कियन्तं कालम् एवं भूत्वा सपुत्रज्ञातिधनबान्धवा उच्छिद्यन्ते । तस्माद् धर्मो न हातव्यः ॥ ४.१७४ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Through unrighteousness*,’—such as causing injury to his master, and
so forth—‘*he prospers*’—gains advancement.

‘*For a time*,’—for the time being only.

Then, ‘*for a while*’—after having gained riches and lands,—‘*he
experiences*’—enjoys—‘*good things*;’—*i.e*., such signs of prosperity
as the presence of many servants, the possession of cattle, horses, and
so forth.

Then, ‘*he conquers his enemies*’—*i.e*., ill-treats such persons as are
poor. What are meant by ‘enemies’ are those persons who, remaining firm
in the path of righteousness, do not have recourse to questionable means
of livelihood; and, in comparison to a rich person, the poverty of such
men would involve a certain amount of *insult*.

Having remained thus for some time, such persons become destroyed ‘*root
and branch*,’ ‘*i.e*., along with their children, relations and riches.

For these reasons, righteousness should not be forsaken.—(1 74).
