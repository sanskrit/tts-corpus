He shall be intent upon auspicious customs, with his mind under control and the senses subjugated; and he shall, untired, daily recite prayers and offer oblations into the fire.—(145)

‘*Auspiciousness*’ consists in the accomplishment of such desirable
things as long life, wealth, and so forth;—the ‘*custom*’ is conducive
to this—such as the wearing of the *gorocanā* -mark on the forehead, the
touching of good fruit, and s o forth;—on such custom he shall be
‘*intent*’; *i.e*., he shall always follow such customs.

“The authority of *customs* has already been asserted before.”

True. But what is asserted here is custom pertaining to non-physical
ends. If those acts were done with a view to visible results, then it
would so happen that the acts would sometimes fail to bring about the
desired result, and this would lead the man to neglect them. It is for
this purpose that the thing is reiterated here. Just as in connection
with the time of starting on a journey, we shall have the reiteration of
such acts as the saluting of cows and other similar things, looking at
white garments, the singing of *kapiñjala-* birds to the right, the
crowing of the crow to the right on a fruit-laden tree. All these acts
shall be done for the sake of one’s welfare; and acts contrary to these
shall be avoided.

‘*With senses subjugated*’—without hankering for the objects of sense.
Though this has been often repeated, us being something desirable for
man, yet it is mentioned here with a view to save the man from falling
into sin.

Since oblation may be offered elsewhere also, the text has specially
mentioned the ‘fire.’

‘*Untired*.’—This only reiterates what has been said before.—(145)

*Vyāsa* (quoted by Gautama).—‘One shall do what is commended, and avoid
what is not commended; this is what has been declared by sages to he the
*auspicious custom*.’

*Gautama* (10, 71).—‘The accomplished student, who, desirous of saving
from evil his parents and relations, senior as well as junior, behaves
in this manner, never falls off from the eternal Brahman.’

*Atri-Saṃhitā* (16-19).—‘This Dharma has been expounded by men for the
religious students, when by having acquired honour in this world, they
reach the highest conditions. Those who, deviating from their own
Dharma, betake themselves to that of others, them the king shall punish,
and thereby rejoice in heaven. he who is linn in his own Dharma, even if
he he a Śūdra, obtains heaven; the Dharma of others should be always
shunned, like the beautiful wife of another man.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.2.27).—‘For all castes, there is high and
immeasurable happiness in the performance of their own Dharma. On
re-birth, by virtue of the residue of his *Karma*, he acquires his
caste, body, complexion, strength, memory, intelligence, riches and
meritorious behaviour.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.1).—‘The Brāhmaṇa who bathes daily, constantly wears
the sacred thread, reads the Veda daily, avoids the Śūdra’s food,
approaches his wife only during

the period and offers oblations according to law, never falls off from
the Brāhmic region.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.205).—‘Even the Householder becomes liberated, if he
has acquired property rightfully, has been devoted to truth and fond of
guests, has performed Śrāddhas and has always spoken the truth.’

Do. (3. 220).—‘By omitting what has been enjoined, by doing what has
been forbidden, and by omitting to control the sense-organs, the man
falls.’
