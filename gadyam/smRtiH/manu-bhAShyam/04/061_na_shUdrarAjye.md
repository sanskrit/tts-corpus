‘*Kingship*’ consists in ruling over a country; he shall not dwell in a
country which is under the sway of a *Śūdra*. The term ‘King’ here
stands for the seven constituents of Kingship,—*vis*., the minister! the
commander of the army, the judge, and so forth; and the present verse
forbids dwelling in a country where all of them belong to the *Śūdra*
caste.

*Objection*:—“It having been already said that he shall not dwell *in an
unrighteous village*, what is meant by ‘in a country surrounded by
unrighteous persons’ is already implied.”

There is no force in this objection. The former prohibition refers to
dwelling in a place *inhabited* by unrighteous persons; while what the
present verse means is that one shall not live in a place where
unrighteous persons, living elsewhere, may happen to congregate. That is
why the text has used the term ‘surrounded;’ the sense being that ‘one
shall not stay at a place which is crowded by such persons.’

Similarly with the country swarming with ‘*impostors*.’ Though these
also, being outside the pale of ‘Vedic religion,’ are included among the
‘unrighteous,’ yet they have been mentioned separately in consideration
of the fact that they pretend to be ‘*righteous*.’

‘*Frequented by*’—associated with—‘*men of the lowest castes*.’ Or,
‘*frequented*’ may mean ‘harassed;’ *e.g*., the Bāhlīka country, which
is frequently outrun by barbarians.—(61)
