**तृप्तिः** क्षुत्पिपासाभ्याम् अपीडनम् । तच् चाढ्यस्यारोगस्य च भवति । तेन बहुधनत्वम् अरोगता च फलम् उक्तं भवति । **अक्षयं सुखम्** । अविशेषितत्वान् नोपकरणं सुखं प्रतीयते । अक्षयं यावज्जीविकम् इत्य् अर्थः । **अन्नदः** सक्त्वोदनादि सिद्धम् अन्नम् आमं च तण्डुलादि । **दीपस्य** दानं चतुष्पथे ब्राह्मणसभायां वा ॥ ४.२२९ ॥
