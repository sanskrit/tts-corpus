“What is here said has already been declared above—(*a*) that ‘he shall
not live at a place surrounded by men...... nor in that which is haunted
by men of the lowest castes’ (4. 6).”

Not so, we reply. What has been forbidden there, is the *inhabiting* of
such places; while what is forbidden here is *associating*. What was
said there was that ‘one shall not set up as a householder in a village
inhabited by such people;’ while the present verse forbids associating
with them; this ‘associating’ consisting of the setting up of friendly
relations by accepting their gifts, living near their house, sitting
with them under the shade of the same tree, and so forth. Further, the
former text speaks of the village as being ‘surrounded,’ which implies
that the said people live there in large numbers; so that, what it means
is that ‘one should not live *even near* a village where the said people
live in large numbers.’ In the present verse, however, what is forbidden
is living near a village, where even a few of these people live. Herein
lies the difference between the two passages.

‘*Pulkasas*’ are Niṣādas, born of Śūdra mothers.

‘*Antyas*,’ *i.e*.—the *Medas* and other *Mleccchas*.

‘*Antyāvasāyins*’—is born from a Niṣāda mother and Cāṇḍāla father; as
will be described later on (10.39).

‘*Haughty*’—overbearing in vanity due to wealth and such other
causes.—(79)

prescribed to be two *cāndrāyaṇas*.—If in an assembly, one comes into
contact with a Mleccha, he shall bathe with his clothes on and go
without food for one day. If a Brāhmaṇa has lived in the dwelling of a
Mleccha for one, two, three or four years (he shall perform an expiatory
