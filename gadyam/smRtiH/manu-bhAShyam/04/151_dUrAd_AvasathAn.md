The water with which the feet are washed is called ‘*feet-washing*;’
this he shall throw far away. Or, the washing of the feet itself may be
done far off.

‘*Niṣeka*’ is *throwing*. As a matter of fact, the water used in bathing
after oiling the body, may also be called ‘*niṣeka*’ But what is
forbidden is the throwing of all kinds of *leavings*; as it is this that
is more generally spoken of as ‘*niseka*.’—(151).

‘*Niṣekam*’—‘Bath-water’ (Medhātithi);—‘Seminal discharge’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 211);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 23), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Niṣeka*’ according to *Kalpataru*, means ‘the throwing away of
used up unclean things’ and ‘*Ucchiṣtānna*’ means ‘the throwing of the
leavings of food’; while Kullūka Bhaṭṭa explains ‘*Niṣeka*’ as ‘seminal
discharge’.
