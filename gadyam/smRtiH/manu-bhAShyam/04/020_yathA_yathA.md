समधिगमो ऽभिनिवेशः अभ्यास इति यावत् । **विजानाति** विशेषेण जानाति । प्रत्यक्षं चैतद् अभ्यस्यमाने ग्रन्थे ऽपि यद् विद्यत इति । तदा **विज्ञानं चास्य रोचते** । उज्ज्वलं भवतित्य् अर्थः । पूर्वस्याः स्मृतेर् मूलकथनम् एतत् । रुचेर् अनभिलाषार्थत्वाद् रुच्यर्थानाम् इति संप्रदानत्वाभावः ॥ ४.२० ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Study*’ here stands for *application*, repeated muling.

‘*Under stands*’—*i.e*., when one studies a treatise repeatedly, one
comes to comprehend fully what is contained in it.

‘*Then his knowledge shines forth*’;—*i.e*., becomes bright. This verse
states the reason for the foregoing verse.

The root ‘*ruc*’ governs the Dative only when it is used in the sense of
‘longing for;’ and, as it does not convey that meaning here, we do not
have the Dative.—(20)
