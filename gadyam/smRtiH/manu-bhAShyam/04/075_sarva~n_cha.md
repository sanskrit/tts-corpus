**अस्तम् इते** आदित्ये । प्रतिलक्षणे कर्मप्रवचनीयत्वात् द्वितीया । **न चोच्छिष्टः** ।

- <u>ननु</u> च ब्रह्मचर्यधर्मेष्व् एतत् प्रतिषिद्धम् । पुरुषधर्मता च तस्य ज्ञापिता । न तादर्थ्यम् एव । 

- <u>सत्यम्</u> । व्रतरूपताज्ञापनार्थ उपदेशो ऽयम् । तेन यावज्जीविकः संकल्पः कर्तव्यः ॥ ४.७५ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

On the sun having set; the accusative ending in ‘*astam*’ is in
accordance with Pāṇini 1. 4. 90.

‘*Nor go anywhere*, *etc*.’—“This has already been forbidden in the
section dealing with the duties of the Student; where it has been also
explained that the prohibition pertains to the men in general, and is
not restricted to the Student only.”

True; but the present injunction is for the purpose of pointing out the
act as an ‘observance;’ and what is meant is that ‘One should make a
life-long determination of not going about with mouth unwashed after
meals.’—(75)
