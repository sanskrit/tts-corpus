Among these four Brāhmaṇa-householders, each later should be regarded as superior, and a superior winner of worlds by virtue of his merit.—(8)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The person who accumulates wealth enough for a shorter time is superior,
better, in point of merit; and superiority of merit leads to superiority
of reward—‘*he is a superior winner of worlds*’—he wins the wolrds;
*i.e*., takes possession of them, as their master; *i.e*., obtains them
for his enjoyment. The suffix ‘*tama*’ denotes *excellence*. In the
absence of qualifications, the term ‘worlds’ here is taken as standing
for the *heavenly regions*.

For these reasons, the rule on this point would be as follows:—

(*a*) He who has vast responsibilities, having many children, whose sons
have not set up separate houses, who has not married away his
daughters,—such a person should possess a granary full of corns;—(*b*)
he, however, who has become advanced in age, has got children, has done
all that he had to do,—such a person, as he goes on withdrawing from
activities, should have recourse to the other alternatives.—(8)
