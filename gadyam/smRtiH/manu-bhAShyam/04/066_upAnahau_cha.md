<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

He should not wear these things, when they have been worn by his father
and others. Gautama says—‘In cases of disability, these may be used
after having been washed.’ (97 (9.7?))

‘*Karaka*’ is the water-pot; the using of the pot that is used by even
his father is contrary to usage. The pot is held to be a relative
substance, and hence can be used only by one to whom it belongs, and by
no other person.

‘*Ornament*’—bracelet of ivory, and so forth. By reason of this being
mentioned along with such cheap articles as the ‘water-pot,’ and the
like, it follows that the use of jewelry and pearl-ornaments is not
forbidden. This is the view of some people.—(66)
