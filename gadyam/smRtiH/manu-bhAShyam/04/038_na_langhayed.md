वत्सबन्धनार्था रज्जुर् **वत्सतन्त्री** वत्सपङ्क्तिर् वा, तां **न लङ्घयेन्** नापक्रामेत् । तथा च गौतमः- "नोपरि वत्सतन्त्रीं गच्छेत्" (ग्ध् ९.५२) । **स्वरूपं** शरीरसंस्थानम् । स्वग्रहणात् परस्य रूपप्रेक्षणं न पर्युदस्यते । **इति धारणा** एष निश्चयः शास्त्रेषु ॥ ४.३८ ॥

‘*Vatsatantrī*’ is the rope to which the calf is tethered; or, it may
mean ‘a line of calves.’ This ‘*he shall* *not* *step over*’— not cross
over. Says Gautama (9.52)—‘One shall not pass over the *vatsatantrī*.’

‘*Figure*’—shape of the body.

‘*Own*’— The addition of this implies that looking at the figure of
other persons is not forbidden.

‘*Such is the established rule*,’—ordained in the scriptures—(38).

This verse is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 71), which explains
‘*vatsatantrī*’ as ‘the rope to which a calf is tied’, and quotes
Haradatta to the effect that ‘*vatsa*’ here stands for the entire
*bovine species*.
