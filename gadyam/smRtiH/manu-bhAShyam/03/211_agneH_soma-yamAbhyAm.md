It is now described what is to be done in the Fire.

The Genitive in ‘*agneḥ*’ has the sense of the Dative;

Agni is one deity, and Soma-Yama conjointly form one conjunct deity;
just like Agni-Soma.

Of these two deities, ‘*having brought about at first, the
satisfaction*, *by the offering of sacrificial food, he should
afterwards satisfy the Pitṛs*.’ That is, he should offer balls of food
and feed the Brāhmaṇas.

In the *Gṛhyasūtra*, other deities have been prescribed; so that the
deities mentioned in the present text are for those who have no
*Gṛhyasūtra* of their own.

‘*Satisfaction*’ *stands* for *sustenance*. That gods are sustained by
sacrificial food, is a laudatory exaggertion.—(211).

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1353), which adds the
following notes:—The meaning is that ‘after having made offerings to (1)
Agni, (2) Soma and (3) Yama, one should satisfy the Fathers who are
present in the person of the invited Brāhmaṇas’;—according to the
explanation given by Medhātithi and Harihara, we have only two deities
here—(1) Agni and (2) the joint deity Soma-Yama; and the genitive ending
in ‘*agneḥ*’ has the sense of the Dative, and this conjoint deity is to
be accepted only by those in whose *Gṛhya* such a joint deity is
mentioned. Our view is that the two, Soma and Yama, are to be treated
separately, not jointly, as is clear from the reading
‘*agnisomayamānāñca*’ adopted by some *Nibandhas*.

as declared before.’

211	Having first, according to the rule, performed, as a means of protecting (the Sraddha), oblations to Agni, to Soma, and to Yama, let him afterwards satisfy the manes by a gift of sacrificial food.
