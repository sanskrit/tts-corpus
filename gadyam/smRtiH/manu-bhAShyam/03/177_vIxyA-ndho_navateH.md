“How can there be any *looking* by the blind man;—by virtue of which the
text says ‘*the* blind man *by looking*, etc.’?”

True; what is meant is only his proximity to the place. The meaning is
that, in an uncovered place, the blind man should be removed away from
such distance from which the man with eyes could see.

‘*The one-eyed man of sixty*;’—this does not mean that if the number is
more than these, they may be fed (even in the presence of the blind,
etc.). All that the reducing of the number means is that the delinquency
would be less serious, and hence the expiatory rite to be performed
would be on a smaller scale.

It is the *leper* that is called ‘*śvitrī*.’

‘*The man suffering from a foul disease*’—is well known,—(177)

“Regarding the diseases which are punishments for sins committed in a
former life, see below, 11.49 *et. seq*.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 454), which adds that what is
meant is that ‘if a blind man remains in a place from where a man with
eyes could see the Brāhmaṇas eating,—then he destroys the merit that
would result from the feeding of ninety men’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 499).

177	A blind man by his presence causes to the giver (of the feast) the loss of the reward for ninety (guests), a one-eyed man for sixty, one who suffers from white leprosy for a hundred, and one punished by a (terrible) disease for a thousand.
