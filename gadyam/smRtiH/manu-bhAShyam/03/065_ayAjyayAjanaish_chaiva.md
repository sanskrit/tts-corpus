By sacrificing for men unworthy to offer sacrifices and by denying (the future rewards for good) works, families, deficient in the (knowledge of the) Veda, quickly perish.—(65)


(Note: the above is an alternate translation by George Bühler)


Verses 57—66 are omitted by Medhātithi. [Query—are they interpolations?] “These are very probably a later addition. The corresponding section in the Mahābhārata, 13.46 stops right here also.”—Hopkins. They are all quoted in Vivādaratnākara and in Parāśaramādhava.

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 676) as setting forth the
causes of the degradation of families; and it explains ‘*mantrataḥ*’ as
‘*vedaiḥ*’, ‘in Veda’;—also to the same effect, in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 589);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra p. 208).
