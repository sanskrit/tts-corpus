In that family, where the husband is pleased with his wife and the wife with her husband, happiness will assuredly be lasting.—(60)


(Note: the above is an alternate translation by George Bühler)


Verses 57—66 are omitted by Medhātithi. [Query—are they interpolations?] “These are very probably a later addition. The corresponding section in the Mahābhārata, 13.46 stops right here also.”—Hopkins. They are all quoted in Vivādaratnākara and in Parāśaramādhava.
