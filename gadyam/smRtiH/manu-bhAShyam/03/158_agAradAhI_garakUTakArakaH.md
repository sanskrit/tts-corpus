The burner of houses.

‘*Garada*’—one who gives to others the *gara-poison*; the mention of
‘*gara*’ is merely indicative; it includes all kinds of poison.

He who eats the food of the adulteress’ son; similarly, he who eats the
food of the widow’s son; the former being meant to be purely indicative.

He who sells Soma; ‘Soma’ is a particular kind of *herb*; he who sells
this *herb*, for use either at sacrifices or for medicine.

Others have explained the term ‘Soma’ (in the expression ‘seller of
Soma’) to mean the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other sacrifices performed with the
Soma. Though the actual ‘selling’of these sacrifices is not
possible,—because an *act* is purely incorporeal,—yet, as a matter of
fact, the practice of ‘selling’ sacrifices is found to be current among
illiterate people; hence the present prohibition. Illiterate people are
found making such assertions in oath as—(*a*) ‘whatever good I have
done, may be yours’ (where they mean to transfer the merit acquired by
their good deeds), and (*b*) ‘that night in which you were born and that
in which you are dying, leaving these two, all your charities and
performances, all your good deeds, your life and offspring I might
destroy, if they injure me’ (An oath). And just as they make use of such
oaths, so also they practice the *Giving* and *Selling* (of acts) by
means of words; and he who does this, is avoided (at *Śrāddha*
-feedings). It is from this that we infer the impropriety of uttering
such oaths and the doing of such verbal givings and sellings.

‘*Sea-voyager*’—one who goes out to the sea.

‘*Bard*’—one who sings the eulogia of men.

‘*Dealer* *in* *oils*’—one who presses sesamum and other oilseeds.

‘*Perjuror*’—one who tells a lie when giving evidence.—(158).

‘*Agāradāhī*’—‘An incendiary; as also (according to Nandana) one who
burns corpses for money’.

‘*Kuṇḍāśī*’—‘One who eats the food of the son of an adultress’
(Medhātithi and Kullūka) ‘the glutton who eats sixty *palas* of rice’
(Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Kūtakārakaḥ*’—‘The perjuring witness’ (Medhātithi, Rāghavānanda and
also Kullūka, whose explanation does not differ from Medhātithi’s as
noted by Buhler);—Medhātithi explains the word as ‘*Sākṣyeṣvanṛtavādī*,’
and Kullūka as ‘*Sākṣivāde mṛṣāvādasya-kartā*’;—‘any one who commits
fraud, *i.e*. a forger, a falsifier of weights and measures’ (Nārāyaṇa
and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687) without any
comment;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 481);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Śrāddha, p. 9a).
