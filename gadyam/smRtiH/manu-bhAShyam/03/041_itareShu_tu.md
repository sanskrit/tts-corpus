<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

From marriages other than the ‘*Brahma*’ and the rest—*i.e*., from the
‘*Gāndharva*,’ and the rest.

‘*Those who say harsh and untrue words*.’— Angry and indecent words
addressed to one’s mother and sisters, etc., are what are meant by
‘*harsh words*.’ The meaning of the term ‘*untrue*’ is well-known.
‘*Nṛśaṃsa-anṛta*,’ compounded copulatively, give the form
‘*nṛśaṃsānṛte*,’ ‘harsh and untrue.’ He who is in the habit of Saying
such words is called ‘*nṛśaṃsānṛtavādin*,’ ‘*addicted to saying harsh
and untrue words*.’ Such is the explanation of the compound term.

‘*Brahmadharma*’ is ‘*Vedic Dharma*,’—*i*. *e*., the *Dharma*, Duty,
laid down in the Veda; those who *despise* it, *i.e*., have no faith in
it.

It is for this reason that these marriages have been deprecatingly
called ‘inferior marriages.’—(41)
