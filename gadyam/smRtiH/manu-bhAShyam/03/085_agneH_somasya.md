**आदाव्** इत्य् अनुवादः । पाठक्रमेणैवाग्नेर् आदौ सिद्धत्वात् ते पृथग् आहुती । **तयोश् च समस्तयोर्** अग्नीषोमाभ्याम् इति, **विश्वेभ्यो देवेभ्य** इति प्रयोगः । एकैवाहुतिर् **धन्वन्तरये** स्वाहा ॥ ३.७५ ॥

The term ‘*first*’ is a mere reiterative reference; that the offering to
Agni is to be made first of all being already indicated by the order in
which the names are mentioned. These two offerings are to be distinct
(one to each); while the next is to the two together—the formula used
being ‘*agnīsomābhyām svāhā*.’ For the next, the formula is ‘*viśvebhyo
devebhyaḥ, svāhā*.’ Only one offering is to be made with the words,
‘*Dhanvantaraye svāhā*,’—(85)
