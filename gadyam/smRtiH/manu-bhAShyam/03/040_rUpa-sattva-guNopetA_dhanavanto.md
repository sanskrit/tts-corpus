‘*Beauty*’—pleasing form.

‘*Qualify of Goodness*’—which is going to be described in Discourse XII.

‘*Endowed with*’ these—*i.e*., possessing these two.

‘*Possessing wealth*’—Wealthy.

‘*Possessing fame*’—Well-known as possessing the qualities of learning,
bravery, and so forth.

‘*With full enjoyment*’—*i.e*., supplied with sufficient quantities of
such means of enjoyment as garlands, sandal-paint, music, vocal and
instrumental, and so forth.

‘*Enjoyment*’ stands for non-separation from the above-mentioned means
of enjoyment; and those for whom this is ‘full’—not deficient,
complete—are said to be ‘with full enjoyment.’

‘*Righteous*,’ ‘*dharmiṣṭha*’—*i.e*., engaged in the performance of
righteous acts. The term ‘*dharma*,’ according to Some, is an adjective;
and hence it has taken the superlative affix (‘*iṣṭha*’).

‘*They live for a hundred years*’—(40)
