The sacrifice that has been described as ‘Ahuta’ is the same as
‘*Japa*.’ ‘*Japa*’ here should be taken as standing for *Vedic study*,
in view of the assertion that ‘by Vedic study one should worship the
sages.’ Or, it may be taken in the sense of the mental operation of
‘recalling to the mind’ (of Vedic texts). The root ‘*japa*’ has been
held to be denotative of both acts—that of loudly reciting, as well as
that of silently recalling to the mind.

The offering into fire is called ‘*Huta*.’

The offering to elementals is ‘Prahuta.’ Though this also is a kind of
‘*Homa*’ yet, in view of the fact that the terra ‘Homa’ is generally
restricted to offerings made into fire, people might think that the
offering to elementals is not ‘*homa*;’ hence (with a view to preclude
this notion) it has been given the name of ‘*Prahuta*,’—the act being
praised as *an excellent* (*pra*) *homa* (*huta*).’

‘*The honouring of Brāhmaṇas is Brāhmya-huta*.’—It is the receiving of
guests that is spoken of here as ‘*honouring of Brāhmaṇas*.’—(74)
