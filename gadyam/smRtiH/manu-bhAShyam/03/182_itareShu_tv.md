A few unfit persons,—such as the *blind*, and the rest—have been
specifically mentioned in the foregoing verses, describing the evil
results of giving food to those unworthy of company; apart from these,
there are others, the ‘*thief*,’ and the rest, mentioned in the several
contexts; when these are fed, the following things accrue to the giver:
*viz*., fat, blood, flesh, &c. That is, he becomes born as creatures who
feed on these things; *i.e*., such creatures us insects and such
carnivorous animals as vultures, and the like.

“*The wise*”—those learned in the Veda say this.

The upshot of the whole is as follows:—If one feeds such persons as are
unworthy of company, the duty of performing the *Śrāddha* is not
accomplished; and its nonperformance leads inevitably to the sin of
disobeying an injunction;—specially, as the injunction of *Śrāddha* is
absolutely obligatory.—(182)

*Mahābhārata* (13. 90, 239).—‘Those *unfit for the line* should be
avoided: those *fit for the line* alone should be invited; if one feeds
the sinful man, he goes to hell.’
