One devoid of right conduct, the man without vigour, the constant beggar, he who lives by agriculture, one suffering from elephantiasis, and he who is spoken ill of by good men.—(165)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Right* *conduct*’ stands here for the ordinary acts of courtesy, such
as offering worship to persons coming to one’s house, and so forth;—he
who is devoid of this.

^(‘)*Without vigour*’—*i.e*., with very little energy; who has lost all
enthusiasm for doing his duties.

‘*Constant beggar*’—one who is always begging, he who teases people by
his begging; it is in the very nature of things that begging should
displease the person bagged from. The term ‘*yācanakaḥ*’ is formed with
the ‘*yu*’ affix, according to Pāṇini 3.1.134, and then the reflexive
‘*ka’* added to it.

‘*He who lives by agriculture*’—by doing the cultivating himself; or
even by the cultivating done by others, if other means of living are
available.

‘*One suffering form elephantiasis*’—whose one leg is thicker than the
other,

‘*He who is spoken ill of by good men*’—the unfortunate man, who is
despised by good men, even without doing anything wrong.—(165)
