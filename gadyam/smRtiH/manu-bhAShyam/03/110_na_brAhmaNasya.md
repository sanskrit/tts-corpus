In a Brāhmaṇa’s house, the Kṣatriya is not called a ‘guest;’ nor the Vaiśya or the Śūdra, nor his friends or relations, or his Teacher.—(110)

क्षत्रियो **ब्राह्मणस्या**ध्वनीनो ऽपि प्रथमभोजनकाल उपस्थिते ऽपि **नातिथिः** । अतो न तस्मै नियमतो देयम् । एवं वैश्यशूद्राभ्याम् अपि । **सखिज्ञाती** आत्मसमे नातिथी । गुरुः प्रभुवद् उपचर्यः, "निवेद्य पचनक्रिया" (ग्ध् ५.२६) इत्य् उक्तम् ॥ ३.१०० ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Even though a *Kṣatriya*, during his travelling, happen to arrive at the
Brāhmaṇa’s house, at the time of breakfast,—he is not a “guest.” Hence
it is not incumbent upon the Brāhmaṇa to offer food to him.

Similarly with the *Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra*.

The ‘*friend*’ and the ‘*relation*’ are one’s *equals*, not *guests*.

The ‘*Teacher*’ has to be served as the master; as described in the
text—‘the act of cooking should be done after having offered to the
Teacher’ (*Gautama* 5-26).—(110).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 354) in support of
the view that in the house of the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya and others are
not to be entertained as regular guests, they are only to have food
offered to them in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 438) to the effect that
wherever the term ‘Brāhmaṇa’ is used in the texts laying down the duty
of entertaining a ‘guest’, it is meant to exclude the *Kṣatriya* and
other castes;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 428).

**(verses 3.110-112)  
**

*Gautama* (5.43).—‘The non-Brāhmaṇa can be the guest of the Brāhmaṇa
only if the former is *one who has been engaged in a sacrifice*.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 452).—‘The non-Brāhmaṇa
cannot be the guest of the Brāhmaṇa; the full honours of the guest are
to be rendered only to the Vedic scholar possessed of special
qualifications; the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya are to be received as
friends; and to the Śūdra something may he offered only by way of
favour, to save him from discomfort.’

*Viṣṇu* (67.36).—\[Reproduces Manu, 111 and 112.\]

*Gautama* (5.44-45).—‘To the Kṣatriya food is to be offered after
Brāhmaṇas; others are to be fed along with servants, as a favour.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.4.18).—‘The Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya (are to
be fed); if a Śūdra happen to arrive, he should be directed to do some
work, and food should be given to him.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.11-13).—‘Morning and evening, whatever food there may
be, out of that he shall make the Vaiśvadeva offerings, and then
entertain, to the best of his power, the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya, the
Vaiśya and the Śūdra that may happen to arrive; but when the Śūdra
arrives, he should be directed to do some work.’

110	But a Kshatriya (who comes) to the house of a Brahmana is not called a guest (atithi), nor a Vaisya, nor a Sudra, nor a personal friend, nor a relative, nor the teacher.
