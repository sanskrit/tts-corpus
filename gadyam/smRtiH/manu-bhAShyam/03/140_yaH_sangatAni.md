**संगतानि** मित्रभावान्[^२५६] यः कुरुते **श्राद्धेन मोहात्** शास्त्रार्थम् अजानानः **स स्वर्गाच् च्यवते** । न प्राप्नोति स्वर्गम् इत्य् अर्थः । असंबन्धसामान्याच् च्यवत इत्य् उच्यते । यथा प्राप्तः स्वर्गं ततश् च्युतः स्वर्गेण न संबध्यते एवम् अयम् अपि । अनेन च स्राद्धफलाप्राप्तिर् एव कथ्यते । सर्वशेषता हि तथा भवति । **श्राद्धमित्रः** श्राद्धं मित्रम् अस्येति । मित्रलाभहेतुत्वात् श्राद्धम् एव मित्रम्, अतो बहुव्रीहिः । **द्विजानाम् अधमः** । द्विजग्रहणं प्रदर्शनार्थम् । शूद्रेणापि न मित्राणि भोजनीयानि ।

‘*Friendships*’—friendly relations—he ‘*who make*’ ‘*by means of
Śrāddhas*’ ‘*through folly*—*i.e*., being ignorant of what is contained
in the scriptures,—*falls from heaven*,’—*i.e*., never reaches heaven;
the root ‘fall’ being used in the sense of *want of connection* in
general; the sense being ‘just as a man on reaching heaven and falling
from there loses all connection with it, so this man also.’ What is
meant is that the man does not obtain the reward for performing the
*śrāddha*. in this sense alone can the passage have any connection with
all that has gone in the present context.

‘*Having the. śrāddha for his friend*;’—the *śrāddha* is spoken of as
his friend, on account of its being the means of his acquiring a friend,
it is in this sense that we have the Bahuvrīhi compound in
‘*śrāddhamitra*.’

‘*The meanest of twice-born men*;’—the ‘twice-born men’ have been
mentioned only by way of illustration; in reality, the *Śūdra* also
should not feed friends at *śrādḍhas*.

“The mere fact of the Śūdra being a *non-Brāhmaṇa* makes it impossible
for him to feed a friend at *śrāddhas* (where only Brāhmaṇas are fed).”

But who has laid down the rule that Brāhmaṇas cannot be the friends of
Śūdras?

“As a matter of fact, it is only persons of the same caste that are
regarded as *friends*; so that there could be no friendship between
persons, one of whom belongs to the higher and the other to the lower
caste.”

This also is not true; since Śvetaketu, the son of Aruṇi, is declared to
have said—‘In the Pañcāla country, there is a *Kṣatriya* friend of
mine.’

Then again, it has already been explained that the term ‘friend’ in the
present context has been used as connoting *relationship* in general.
And Brāhmaṇas also come to have pecuniary relations with *Śūdras*; and
to the *Pāraśavaśūdra* (the Śūdra born of a Brāhmaṇa father and a
*Śūdra* mother), Brāhmaṇas hear even blood-relationships.—(140)

140	That meanest among twice-born men who in his folly contracts friendships through a funeral sacrifice, loses heaven, because he performed a Sraddha for the sake of friendship.
