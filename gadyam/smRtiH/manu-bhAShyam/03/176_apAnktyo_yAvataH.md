If one who is unworthy of company happen to look upon a number of those that are worthy of company, while those are eating, then the foolish giver (of food) does not obtain the reward of feeding so many men.—(176).

पङ्क्तिम् अर्हन्तीति **पङ्क्त्याः** । सद्भिर् एकत्रासनभोजनाद्यर्हता पङ्क्त्यता, तदभावाद् **अपङ्क्त्यः** । स **यावतः पङ्क्त्यान्** विद्वत्तपस्विश्रोत्रियान् **भुञ्जानान् अनुपश्यति**, **तावतां न तत्र** पितृतृप्त्याख्यं **फलं** भवति । अतः स्तेनादयः श्राद्धं कुर्वता ततः प्रदेशाद् अपसारणीयाः । **बालिशो** मूर्खः ॥ ३.१६६ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Pāṅktya*’ are those that deserve the *paṅkti, line*. One is called
‘*pāṅktya*’ when one is deserving of sitting on the same seat as, and
eating in the company of, good men. He who is not so deserving, is
‘*a-pāṅktya*.’

As many worthy people—learned men, ascetics and persons learned in the
Veda—the unworthy man happens to look upon while the former are
eating,—the reward of feeding so many men,—in the shape of the
satisfaction of his ancestors—fails to be accomplished.

For this reason, when one is performing *śrāddhas*, one should send away
from that place all thieves and others.

‘*Foolish*’—ignorant.—(176)

*Mahābhārafa* (13.137.17).—‘The one-eyed person defiles sixty; the
eunuch, a hundred; the man suffering from leucoderma, as much as he sees
_(;)—in the line of invitees seated in a line.’

176	The foolish giver (of a funeral repast) does not reap the reward for as many worthy guests as a man, inadmissible into company, can look on while they are feeding.
