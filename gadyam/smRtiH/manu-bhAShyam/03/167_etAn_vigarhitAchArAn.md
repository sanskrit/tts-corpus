These men, whose ‘*conduct*’—line of action—is ‘reprehensible.’ The
‘blind’ and the rest having their previous misconduct indicated by these
disabilities; while the ‘thief,’ etc., have their misconduct actually
perceptible in the present.

‘*At both*’— rites for gods and pitṛs.

‘*Should avoid*’— should exclude.

‘*Unworthy of company*’—*i.e*., they do not deserve company. The
‘*ḍhak*’ affix denoting *presence. Absence from company indicates
unworthiness*. That is, he does not deserve to eat in the company of
other Brāhmaṇas. It is for this reason that such persons have been
called ‘defilers of company;’ the meaning being that those who sit at
dinner with them become defiled.—(167)

167	A Brahmana who knows (the sacred law) should shun at (sacrifices) both (to the gods and to the manes) these lowest of twice-born men, whose conduct is reprehensible, and who are unworthy (to sit) in the company (at a repast).
