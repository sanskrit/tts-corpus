‘*Brāhmaṇas*’—*i.e*., guests.

‘*His men people*’—people of the same caste, and so forth. When all
these have eaten, then ‘what is left by them,’ the husband and wife
should eat.

‘*Afterwards*’—this is added with a view to perclude the notion that a
portion of the food having been assigned to the guests and others, and
kept aside, the remainder might be called ‘what is left,’ and as such
might be eaten by the householder and his wife, even before the guests,
&c.

Half of this verse is meant to be the injunction of the time for the
husband and wife to eat; the rest of it is a purely descriptive
reference.—(116)

down the manner in which the Householder himself should take his
food;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 456) without comment.
