Where the female relations live in grief, the family soon wholly perishes; but that family where they are not unhappy ever prospers.—(57)


(Note: the above is an alternate translation by George Bühler)


Verses 57—66 are omitted by Medhātithi. [Query—are they interpolations?] “These are very probably a later addition. The corresponding section in the Mahābhārata, 13.46 stops right here also.”—Hopkins. They are all quoted in Vivādaratnākara and in Parāśaramādhava.

*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 417.) explains ‘*jāmayaḥ*’ as ‘ladies of the
family; sisters, daughters-in-law, and so forth’.
