<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In verse 22, it has been asserted that the author was going to describe
‘the good and bad points of offsprings;’ this is what is being done now.

‘*Anupūrvaśaḥ*’ (successively) is an expression that authors of *Smṛtis*
use in the sense of ‘*ānupurvyeṇa*.’

The honour and fame that one receives by virtue of his learning,
knowledge and superior wisdom, are called ‘Brahmic glory;’ those
possessed of this are called ‘endowed with Brahmic glory,’ The term ends
in the Possessive affix ‘*in*.’

‘*Respected by cultured persons*’—favoured, not hated, not ill-treated;
*i.e*, liked. Inasmuch as the root in ‘*sammata*’ does not signify
*thinking*, it does not fall under Pāṇini’s Sūtṛa.3. 2. 188; and hence
the compounding does not become precluded by Pāṇiṇi 2. 2. 12; and the
genitive ending in ‘*śiṣṭa*’ denotes mere relationship in general.—(39)

‘*Śiṣṭa*’—defined under 12. 109.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 487); and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 865), which says that this describes the
results accruing from the different forms of marriage.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 117) along with verses 40 and 41, which
adds that all this pertains to the Brāhmaṇa;—in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p.
683);—in *Smṛticandrikā*, (Saṃskāra, p. 230);—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 99).

**(verses 3.39-42)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (24.34-37).—‘He who gives his girl in marriage by the Brāhma
form goes to the regions of Brahman; by the Daiva, to Heaven; by the
Ārṣa, to the regions of Viṣṇu; by the Prājāpatya, to the regions of the
gods; and by the *Gāndharva* form, one goes to the region of the
Gandharvas.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.17).—‘It is well known that as the marriage-forms, so
the offspring.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.12.4).—‘To the extent that the form of
marriage is the right one, to that same extent is the offspring born
thereof of the right kind.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 865).—\[Reproduces the words of
Manu.\]

*Dakṣa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 866).—‘The reward accruing from the
marrying of a girl by the right form is double in the case of her being
given to a Brāhmaṇa; a hundred-thousandfold in that of her being given
to a learned Brāhmaṇa; and endless in that of her being given to a
thoroughly learned Brāhmaṇa.’
