What has been said above in regard to the ‘*most deserving Brāhmaṇa*’ is
further explained.

‘*By feeding at least one learned Brāhmaṇa, one obtains a full
reward*;—what is meant by ‘learning’ has already been explained; it
consists in knowing the Veda and its meaning; that this is so, is also
shown by what follows in the text: ‘*not by feeding even many men
ignorant of the Veda*;’ the term ‘*mantra*’ here stands for the *Veda*.

In the absence of *five* Brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda, one should feed
at least one;—such is the meaning of the present injunction.

‘*Full*’—great, large.—(129)

perfection of the Śrāddha: learned in all Vedas, learned in one Veda,
conversant with Brahman, young, knowing the meaning of the Veda, the
Jyeṣṭhasāman, Trimadhu, Trisuparṇaka, sister’s son, officiating priest,
son-in-law, one for whom the performer officiates at sacrifices,

austerities, maintainor of five Fires, religious student, those devoted
to their parents.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 439).—‘One shall feed ascetics, well-behaved
householders, old men, persons devoted to good acts, those learned in
the Veda, pupils not residing with the teacher; life-long resident
students also may be fed if exceptionally qualified.’

129	Let him feed even one learned man at (the sacrifice) to the gods, and one at (the sacrifice) to the manes; (thus) he will gain a rich reward, not (if he entertains) many who are unacquainted with the Veda.
