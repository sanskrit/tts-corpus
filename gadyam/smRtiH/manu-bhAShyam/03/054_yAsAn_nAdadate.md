In the case of girls whose relations do not appropriate the bride’s gift, it is not “selling;” It is only a means of honouring the maidens and is entirely harmless.—(54)

किं वराद् धनाधिगमो विक्रयो भवति । नेति ब्रूमः । **ज्ञातयः** कन्यायाम् अधिकृताः स्वार्थम् **आददते** गृह्णन्ति तदा **स विक्रयः** । **अर्हणं** कन्यार्थे धनग्रहणं कन्यानां **तद् अर्हणं** पूजनं भवति । बहुमानः कन्यानाम् आत्मनि भवति- "ईदृश्यो वयं यद् धनं दत्वा विवाह्यामहे" । अन्यत्रापि पूज्या भवन्ति "सुभगा एताः" इति । आभरणादि वा तेन धनेन कर्तव्यम् अतो ऽभ्यर्हिताः शोभावत्यो भवन्ति । **आनृशंस्यम्** अपापत्वं केवलं न स्वल्पो ऽप्य् अधर्मगन्धो ऽस्ति । अतो ऽनेनार्थवादेन कन्यार्थं धनग्रहणं विधीयते ॥ ३.५४ ॥

The question being—“Does the mere act of receiving gifts from the
bridegroom make the marriage a *sale*?”—our answer is that it is not so;
it is when the ‘*relations*’ of the bride,—*i.e*., those in charge of
her—accept gifts for themselves, then alone it is ‘selling.’

‘*Means of honouring*’:—The receiving of presents on behalf of brides
becomes a means of honouring them; it raises the girls in their own
estimation; they come to think that ‘we are so good that we are being
married after receiving proper presents;’ they rise in the estimation of
the people also, who look upon such brides as very ‘handsomely
fortunate.’ Or, when out of the presents received ornaments are made for
them, and they are decked in them, they look beautiful.

‘*Harmless*’—it involves no sin; *i.e*., there is not the slightest
taint of sin in this act.

What this exaggerated statement indicates is that the accepting of
presents on behalf of the bride is permitted.—(54).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 850) in support of
the view that if the ‘cow-pair’ given by the bridegroom in the *Ārṣa*
marriage is accepted, not in greed,—then it is to be looked upon only as
a means of honouring the bride, and not as a ‘price’ paid for her. It
explains the word ‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’ as ‘not sinful.’

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 156) also quotes it in support of the view that if
the ‘cow-pair’ is accepted on behalf of the bride, there is nothing
wrong in it,—the verse being explained as follows—That ‘consideration’
which is accepted on behalf of the bride, constitutes the ‘honouring’ of
the girl, and as such is not sinful;—*i.e*., the ‘consideration’ thus
received should be handed over to the girl.

It is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 100), which explains
‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’ as ‘honest dealing’;—in *Saṃskā raratnamālā* (p. 479)
winch explains ‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’ as ‘not sinful—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 233), which explains the meaning as ‘what is received as
fee for the girl, that is only a *present* to the bride,’—and is
‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’, ‘nothing sinful.’

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśā. 81.1-2; also 13.46.1-2).—‘People learned in
ancient lore quote the words of Prācetasa to the effect that in cases
where the relations do not appropriate anything for themselves, it is
not *selling*, it is only a method of honouring the girls, and as such,
entirely harmless and righteous; the whole of the present received
should he made over to the girl.’

054	When the relatives do not appropriate (for their use) the gratuity (given), it is not a sale; (in that case) the (gift) is only a token of respect and of kindness towards the maidens.
