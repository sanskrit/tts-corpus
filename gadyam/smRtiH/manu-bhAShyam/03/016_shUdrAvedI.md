‘*Śūdrāvedi*’ is one who acquires—*i.e*., marries—a *Śūdra* girl.

‘*Becomes an outcasts*’—*i.e*., as good as an outcaste.

Such is the opinion of Atri, and of Utathya’s son. The authorities have
been mentioned with a view to inspire respect.

The first half of the verse is supplementary to the prohibition
contained in the preceding verse.

‘*According to Śaunaka*, *by the birth of a child*.’ This is an entirely
different rule. It presumes that marriage with a Śūdra girl is
permitted, and then prohibits intercourse with her during her ‘courses’;
‘birth of a son’ is possible only by having intercourse on the even days
of the woman’s period. Thus the meaning is that ‘one should not have
intercourse with his Śūdra wife during her courses.’

‘*According to Bhṛgu, by having children from her*.’ This also is a
distinct rule by itself. ‘*Tadapalya*’ is one who has only such children
as. are born of his *Śūdra* wife; and the character of such a man is
called ‘*tadapatyatā*.’ This is the opinion of *Bhṛgu*; which means that
‘after one has begotten children from wives of the more respectable
castes, he may have intercourse with the Śūdra wife.’

The mention of ‘outcaste’ here is only meant to indicate degradation; it
does not mean that the man is to be actually treated as an ‘outcaste,’
as described under 11.182. All this we shall explain later on.—(16).

According to Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Nandana and Rāghavānanda, the
meaning of this verse is as translated. According to Nārāyaṇa’s
explanation, the translation would read as follows (rendered by
Buhler):—“A man of the family of Atri who weds a Śūdra female, becomes
an outcaste; one of the race of Utathya’s son, on the birth of a son;
and one of Śaunaka’s or Bhṛgu’s race, by having no other but Śūdra
offspring.’ Buhler adds—“It ought to be noted that, according to Kullūka
alone, the three classes refer to Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas
respectively. Rāghavānanda particularly objects to the opinion.”

Burnell ??tes that the rule attributed here to Gautama (Utathya’s ???n)
is not found in the Sūtras of Gautama, where we find only a general
statement regarding the unlawful character of Śūdra offsprings of
twice-born men. And Hopkins says the same thing in regard to the *Smṛti*
of Atri.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 495);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 750); neither of which provides any
explanation of this rather obscure verse;—in *Aparārka* (p. 88), which
explains the meaning to be that “according to Atri and Gautama, the
Brāhmaṇa marrying a Śūdra girl ‘falls’ by the mere act of marriage;
according to Śaunaka, by begetting a son on her; and according to Bhṛgu,
when a grandson is born from her;”—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 361),
which notes that this and the next verse are only meant to deprecate the
marrying of a *Śūdra* girl, ‘in the improper order’;—and in
*Smṛti-candrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 208), which adds the following notes:—The
Brāhmaṇa marrying a Śūdra girl becomes degraded,—this is the opinion of
Atri and of the ‘son of Utathya,’ *i.e*. Gautama;—hence according to
these authorities the Brāhmaṇa should never marry a Śūdra
girl;—according to Śaunaka, however, degradation results, not from
marrying, but from begetting a child on a *Śūdra* wife,—hence according
to him, the man should avoid the Śūdra wife during the
‘periods—according to Bhṛgu again, even the begetting of a child does
not lead to degradation, what leads to it is the circumstance that the
Brāhmaṇa has no children except those from his *Śūdra* wife,—so that
according to Bhṛgu only so long as he has not got a child from his
Brāhmaṇa wife shall the Brāhmaṇa avoid his Śūdra wife during the
periods’.
