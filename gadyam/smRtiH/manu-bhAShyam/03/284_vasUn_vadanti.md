<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse is intended to prompt a man who, through ill-will towards his
father, is disinclined to perform Śrāddhas.

The three grades of ancestors, to whom balls are offered, are the same
as the Vasus and other gods; hence they should be looked upon as gods.

‘*Such is the text*’—this is found in the Veda; hence ‘*ancient*’—the
Veda being eternal.—(284)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 461), which explains the meaning
to be that the Father should be thought of as Vasu, the grandfather as
Rudra and the great-grandfather as Āditya;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
64);—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 562) as setting forth the form
of the Pitṛs.

*Yājñavalkya* (1.269).—‘The Pitṛs are the deities of the Śrāddha—Vasu,
Rudra and Āditya; and being satisfied with the Śrāddha, they satisfy the
Pitṛs.’

*Nandipurāṇa* (Caturvargacintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 64).—‘Viṣṇu is the father
of the world, Brahmā the grand-father and myself (Śiva), the
great-grand-father.’

*Ādityapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘The months are the father, the seasons the
grand-father and the year the great-grandfather of the people.’
