On the Vaiśvadeva having been finished, if another guest should happen to arrive,—for him also he should provide food to the best of his ability; but he shall not make any offering (out of that food).—(108)

सर्वार्थम् अन्नं **वैश्वदेव**शब्देनोच्यते । तस्मिन् **निर्वृत्ते** निष्पन्ने, भुक्तवत्सु सर्वेषु, निःशेषिते ऽन्ने, **यद्य् अन्यो ऽतिथिर्** आगच्छेत् तस्मै दद्यात् पुनः पक्वान्नम् । न तु तस्मात् पाकबलिं हरेत् । अग्नाव् अपि होमो नेष्यते, न केवलं बलिहरणम् । यतः सायंप्रातः पाके होमो बलिहरणम्, न चान्तरालिके । तथा च वक्ष्यति "सायं त्व् अन्नस्य" इति (म्ध्। ३.१११) । एवं च यद्य् अप्य् असकृद् अह्नः पचेत् तथापि न प्रतिपाकं वैश्वदेवम् आवर्तेत । **यथाशक्ति** संस्कारविशेषेणेतरथा वा ॥ ३.९८ ॥

Food cooked for all is referred to here by the term ‘*Vaiśvadeva*;’ on
this being ‘*finished*’—*i.e*., all persons having eaten, and the food
having been exhausted,—if another guest should arrive, then for him also
he shall provide cooked food; but out of this latter food, he shall not
make the offering that is made out of food that is cooked in the
household.

The oblation into the tire also—and not only the *offering*—is not to be
made (out of this food); because oblations and offerings have been laid
down as to be made out of the food cooked in the morning and evening,
and not out of the intervening cookings; as is going to be asserted
below (in verse 121). So that, if one happens to cook several times
during the day, he should not repeat the *Vaiśvadeva* offering with each
cooking.

‘*To the best of his ability*’—*i.e*., with elaborate seasonings or
otherwise.—(108)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on l. 103, p. 76) in support of the
view that the Vaiśvadeva offering is not meant to be sanctifìcatory of
the food; it is performed only for the accomplishing of certain
desirable ends for the Householder—*e.g*., what is mentioned under 2.28.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 311) quotes it, and adds the following note:—The
*Vaiśvadeva* offering having been made, and one guest having been duly
entertained, if a second one happens to arrive, and there is no cooked
food left for him, then food should be cooked for him; but out of this
latter no *Vaiśvadeva* offering need be made. If this offering were
meant to be sanctificatory of the food, then it would be necessary to
make it each time the food might be prepared; and the prohibition of the
second offering can be justified only if it is *not* sanctificatory of
the food. Some people have held that this offering has the dual
character (a) of being sanctificatory of the food, and (b) of fulfilling
a desirable purpose for the man.

It is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 305), which also adds that the
interdicting of the second *Vaiśvadeva* offering clearly indicates that
it is not regarded as sanctificatory of the food;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā*
(p. 924), which explains ‘*nivṛtte*’ as ‘after taking his food’;—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 284), which adds the following explanation:—‘Where
the Vaiśvadeva offering has been made and the Honouring of the guest
also done, if another guest arrives and there is no cooked food left,
then another food should be cooked and offered to him, but the
Vaiśvadeva offering need not be made out of this second instalment of
cooking.’

either *Vrīhi* or *Yava* cooked for him.’

108	But if another guest comes after the Vaisvadeva offering has been finished, (the householder) must give him food according to his ability, (but) not repeat the Bali offering.
