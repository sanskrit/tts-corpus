‘*Whatever*’—*food*—‘*mixed with honey*;’—‘*on the thirteenth day,
during the rains*, *and under the asterism of Maghā*,’—‘*that is
imperishable*,’ The season, the asterism and the date are to be taken
together as the desired qualification.

According to the declaration of Āpastamba, the same holds good regarding
offerings made during the rains, on the thirteenth, eighth and tenth
days of the month also. As regards the asterism of Maghā, however, there
is no option; as he says—‘there is abundance under the asterism of
Maghā,’ (Āpastamba, 2.8.19-20).—(273)

“The day meant is *Bhādrapada*, *Badi*, 13”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 117) without comment;—in
*Aparārka* (p. 555), which adds that the Accusative ending in
‘*trayodaśīm*’ has the force of the Locative;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
201);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 272), which explains the meaning as
‘whatever mixed with Honey is offered on the thirteenth of the month,
under the asterism of *Maghā* becomes inexhaustible’;—in
*Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 385);—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 356);—and in
*Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 470 and Śrāddha, p. 87).
