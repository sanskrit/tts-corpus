‘*Duly*’—*i.e*., with the mind bent upon the deity, and not wandering
over anything else.

Having offered in the Fire the oblation to these deities—he should place
‘*in all directions*, *proceeding*,’ in due order, ‘*towards his
right*;’ at first in the East, then in the South, and so forth, this
being the ‘movement towards one’s right;’

‘*To* *Indra, Antaka, Ap-pati and Indu*’—in each direction.

Another writer remarks that ‘Indu’ has no share in the oblation (the
offering being made to *Soma*). If this name is not to be used in making
the offering, how could ‘Indu’ be spoken of (as he is in this verse) as
a partaker of the oblation? And it has been explained that the ‘placing
of the *bali*’ is nothing other than *Homa*.

As a matter of fact, no stress is meant to be laid upon the special form
of the names used; as they have been used only in view of the exigencies
of metre; so that, in actual usage, the names to be used should be those
mentioned in other *Smṛtis*.

‘*Along with their followers*’—‘followers’ stands for servants,
attendants; the formula used in such cases being ‘*Indrapuruṣebhyaḥ
svāhā*,’ and so forth.—(87)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 402), where it is
added that ‘*evam*’ means ‘in the manner of the sacrifice to Gods’.

087	After having thus duly offered the sacrificial food, let him throw Bali offerings in all directions of the compass, proceeding (from the east) to the south, to Indra, Yama, Varuna, and Soma, as well as to the servants (of these deities).
