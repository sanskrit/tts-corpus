The rest of Brāhmaṇas, who, when duly invited at the rite in honour of Gods and Pitṛs, happens, somehow, to neglect it, incurs sin and becomes a hog.’—(190)

‘*Ketitaḥ*’ means *invited*.

‘*Havye kavye*’—at the rite in honour of Gods, and at the rite in honour
of the Pitṛs. Having accepted the invitation and promised to eat,—if
‘*somehow he neglects it*,’—*i.e*., does not present himself at the time
of eating, or, if he does not maintain continence,—then such a Brāhmaṇa
‘*becomes a hog*.’

‘*Somehow*’—*i.e*., either intentionally, or through lapse of memory.

‘*Duly*’—this has been added for the purpose of filling up the verse.

Others have held that the ‘*neglect*’ here stands for *non-acceptance of
the invitation*; according to what has been said in the
*Śrāddhakalpa*—‘one should not fail to accept the invitation of a man
free from all blame.’

This, however, is not right; it is through desire to eat that men become
prone to go to *śrāddhas*; and if a man happens to have no such desire,
and hence refuses the invitation, what sin could there be in
this?—(190.)

‘*Atikrāman*’—‘Does not present himself at the time of eating, and does
not maintain continence’ (Medhātithi, who is slightly misrepresented by
Buhler, who attributes to him only the latter part of the
explanation);—‘breaks the appointment’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa
and Rāghavānanda);—‘who does not accept the invitation’ (‘others’ in
Medhātithi, who rejects this explanation).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 701) in support of
the view that the man ‘who having accepted the invitation, subsequently
refuses it, even though quite fit to respond to it, incurs a sin.’ It
explains ‘*ketitaḥ*’ as ‘being invited.’

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 565) quotes the verse;—also *Aparārka*, (p. 457),
which adds that this refers to the person who has accepted the
invitation;—and *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1002), which adds the following
notes;—‘*Ketitaḥ*,’ invited;—the meaning is that if, on an invitation,
the invited fails to keep the restrictions, he becomes a
pig;—‘*Kathañcit*,’ intentionally or through forgetfulness; others hold
that ‘*atikrāman*’ means ‘not accepting the invitation,’ but this view
has been criticised and rejected by Medhātithi.

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 701).—‘Having been invited, if the Brāhmaṇa
goes elsewhere to take his food, he goes to a hundred hells and is born
among Cāṇḍālas.’

*Ādipurāṇa* (Do.).—‘Being invited, the Brāhmaṇa should not be late; one
who is late... falls into hell.’

190	But a Brahmana who, being duly invited to a rite in honour of the gods or of the manes, in any way breaks (the appointment), becomes guilty (of a crime), and (in his next birth) a hog.
