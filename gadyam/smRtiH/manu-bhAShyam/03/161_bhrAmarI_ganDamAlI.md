<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The words here used signify particular diseases.

‘*Bhrāmarī*’—is an epileptic.

‘*Gaṇḍamāti*’—on whose cheeks and throat there appear swellings in the
form of a string.

‘*Śvitra*’—is white leprosy, leucoderma.

‘*Piśuna*,’ ‘*backbiter*,’ is one who betrays other people’s secrets,
and accuses them on the sly.

‘*Lunatic*’—whose mind is unsettled, either when there is derangement of
his humours or when he is obssessed by a ghost, and he says and does
things at random.

‘*Blind man*’—who is without eyes.

‘*Derider of the Veda*’—“The *derider of the Veda* has been already
mentioned before by the term ‘*brahmadviṭ*’ ‘who is inimical to
Brahman,’ where the term ‘*brahman*’ has been explained as having
several meanings (signifying the *Brāhmaṇa* as well as the *Veda*).”

Not so; *deriding* is something totally different from being *inimical*;
being *inimical* is a property of the mind, while *deriding* is speaking
ill, of one by words expressing disregard.—(161)

481);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 9a).
