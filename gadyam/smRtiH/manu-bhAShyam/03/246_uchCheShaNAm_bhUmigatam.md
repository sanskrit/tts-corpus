पात्रस्थस्य पूर्वेण प्रतिपत्तिर् उक्ता । भूमौ निपतितस्योच्छिष्टस्य दासवर्गार्थतानेन कथ्यते । **अजिह्मो** ऽकुटिलः । **अशठः** अनलसः । तादृशस्य **दासवर्गस्य** स भागः । तस्मात् प्रभूतं दातव्यम्, येन भूमौ बुञ्जानस्य पततीति ॥ ३.२३६ ॥

The preceding verse has described the disposal of the remnant in the
dishes; the present verse mentions the fact that the remnant fallen on
the ground is for servants.

‘*Ajihma*’ means ‘*not dishonest*,’ ‘straightforward.’

‘*Aśaṭha*’ is ‘not idle,’ ‘dutiful.’

Of such servants the said remnant is the share.

For this reason, large quantities of food shall be served, so that, when
the invited person is eating, something may fall on the ground.—(246)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.239) in support of the view
that ‘the food served to the Brāhmaṇas should be served in sufficiently
large quantities, to make it possible for there being *leavings*, which
constitute the share of the servants and others;—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 376), without any comment;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 325);—in
*Aparārka* (p. 504), which adds that what has been left fallen on the
ground by the Brāhmaṇas should be offered for such honest and hard
working slaves as may have died;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 151 and
1511), which adds that *dāsavarga* here stands for the father’s
principal servant who may be dead;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p.
562).
