These ‘*have expectations from family-men*,’—*i.e*., seek to obtain
presents from them. ‘*Expectation*’ means wishing for help and benefits.

For this reason, one should fulfil towards them—the gods, &c.—all that
is enjoined, in the shape of offerings, &c. ‘*One who knows*’—the
ordinances of the scriptures.

‘*Family*’ stands for *wife*.

It is not right to disappoint the hopes cherished by even an ordinary
man, what to say of the gods, etc.? This is a praise of the
‘sacrifices.’—(80)

*Baudhāyana* (2.6.35).—‘When he is horn, the Brāhmaṇa is beset with
three debts; he repays that to the sages, by means of religious
studentship, that to the gods, by means of sacrifice, that to the Pitṛs,
by means of offspring. There are innumerable debt-contracts; the three
Vedas, religious studentship, begetting of children, śrāddha, austerity,
and sacrifices,—one who performs all this, from him passes off all
impurity.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.29).—\[Reproduces Manu.\]

080	The sages, the manes, the gods, the Bhutas, and guests ask the householders (for offerings and gifts); hence he who knows (the law), must give to them (what is due to each).
