‘*Having brought* *up*’—having presented before the Brāhmaṇas,—‘*he
shall serve it*’—which means the placing of it in the dish in which the
person eats. Though all that is meant by ‘serving’ is the placing of the
food within reach of the diner,—yet this placing should be done in such
a way that among the several persons dining, the articles of food shall
not flow from one man’s dish into another’s.

‘*Qualities*,’—*i.e*., those qualities of the Hard and Soft food, which
consist of acidity, etc.,—these he should describe, saying—‘this is
acid—this is sweet,—this is a pastry’ and so forth. When they have been
thus apprised, ‘he should give them whatever they relish most’—this has
to be construed from what follows later on (in verse 231).

‘*Gently*’—this is a reiteration for filling up the metre.—(228)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 230) without comment;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1308);—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 546),
which explains ‘*guṇān*’ as ‘sweetness and the rest’;—and in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī*, (pp. 158 and 164), which explains ‘*śanakaiḥ*’ as
‘one after the other’, ‘*guṇān prachodayan*’ as ‘mentioning that *this
is sweet, this is acid*, and so forth.’
