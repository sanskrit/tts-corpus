Having placed a Śūdrā woman on his bed, the Brāhmaṇa goes to perdition; and having begotten a son by her, he falls from Brāhmaṇahood itself.—(17).

This is a laudatory exaggeration.

If on the Śūdra wife he begets a son, *he falls from Brāhmaṇahood itself
i.e*., the son becomes a non-Brāhmaṇa. This also is a deprecatory
exaggeration.

‘*Son*’—is in the masculine gender. So that (in the preceding verse
also) the term ‘*begetting of children*,’ ‘*sutotpattyā*,’ should be
taken to refer to the *male* child; even though in the compound the word
can be taken both ways—either as ‘*sutā*’ in the Feminine, or as
‘*suta*’ in the Masculine. It is with this view that we have pointed out
above that what is prohibited is intercourse with the woman on the even
days of her ‘period’ (as it is only by intercourse on those days that a
male child is born).—(17).

Hopkin’s remarks—“A significant alteration in the Mahābhārata 13.47.9
makes the last part of this verse read—‘He is nevertheless purified by a
ceremony known in law’.”—One fails to see what is ‘significant’ in this,
when Hindu law bristles with expiatory ceremonies in connection with
much more heinous offences than the marrying of a Śūdra wife.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.265, p. 1326) as meant to
indicate the gravity of the offence, and as laying down the actual
irrevocable loss of Brāhmaṇahood;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 495)
as prohibiting the marrying of the Śūdra by the twice-born;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 750);—in *Aparārka* (p. 87);—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 361);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 208),
which notes that what this forbids is the marrying and begetting of
child on a Śūdra wife before a Brāhmaṇa wife.

017	A Brahmana who takes a Sudra wife to his bed, will (after death) sink into hell; if he begets a child by her, he will lose the rank of a Brahmana.
