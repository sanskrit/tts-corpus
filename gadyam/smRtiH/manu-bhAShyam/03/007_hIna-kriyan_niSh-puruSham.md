‘*That in which the sacred rites*’—the natal and other sacraments—‘*have
been abandoned*’—neglected; *i.e*., in which the consecratory rites as
also the compulsory ‘Five Sacrifices,’ etc., are not performed.

‘*Male-less*’—productive of females; *i.e*., in which, aṣa rule, only
female, not male, children are born;

‘*Devoid of the Veda*’—destitute of Vedic study.

‘*Romaśārśasam*’—This copulative compound mentions two kinds of
families. ‘*Romasha,’ ‘woolly*,’—*i.e*. the members of which have their
arms and limbs covered with much and long hair. ‘*Piles*’—fleshy
protuberances in the anus, which being a disease, are extremely painful.

‘*Phthisis*’—the disease of consumption.

‘*Dyspepsia*’—slow-digestion: by which the food eaten is not properly
digested.

‘*Epilepsy*’—leading to loss of memory and other cognate troubles.

‘*Leucoderma*’—white spots on the body, with holes.

‘*Leprosy*’—is well-known.

All these words—beginning with ‘*romasha*’—are names of particular
diseases, and are to be taken as ending in possessive affixes.

Older commentators have explained that the prohibition. herein contained
is based entirely upon ordinary visible considerations: As a matter of
fact, bipeds inherit the peculiarities of their mother’s families;
hence, children born of mothers belonging to families that have
‘abandoned the sacred rites,’ etc., etc, would be prone to the same
defects;

and diseases ace apt to be infectious; works on medicine having declared
that ‘all diseases, with the sole exception of’ Diarrhoea, are
infectious.’—(7)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 588), where
‘*hīnakriyam*’ is explained as ‘devoid of the performance of such acts
as the sacrifice and the like;’—‘*Niṣpuruṣam*’ as ‘that in which females
are the sole survivors—‘*niśchandaḥ*’ as ‘devoid of Vedic study;’—also
in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 477), which has exactly the same
explanation of precisely the same words.

*Aparārka* (p. 84) quotes this along with the preceding verse;—and adds
the following explanations:—‘*Hīnakriyam*’ means ‘devoid of the proper
performance of the Conception and other Sacramental
Rites,’—‘*Niṣpuruṣam*’ means ‘a family in which girls alone are
born,’—‘*Niśchandaḥ*’ is ‘devoid of Vedic study,’—‘*lomasham*’ is ‘that
members whereof have their body covered with inordinately prominent
hairs,’—and ‘*arshasam*’ means ‘suffering from piles.’—It is quoted in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 204) which adds the following
explanations:—‘*Hīnakriyam*,’ not engaged in the performance of
sacrifices and other religious acts;—‘*Niṣpuruṣam*,’ without a male
master—‘*Niśchandaḥ*’ devoid of Vedic learning—‘*romasham*,’
hairy,—‘*arshasam*’, suffering from the particular disease, piles,—all
these qualifications pertain to the children of the family;—and in
*Saṃskāra*-*ratnamālā* (p. 508), which has the following
notes;—‘*Hīnakriyam*’, not performing the prescribed duties, *i.e*., not
avoiding prohibited acts,—‘*Niṣpuruṣam*’, devoid of male
progeny,—‘*arshasam*’ family in which the disease runs hereditary.
