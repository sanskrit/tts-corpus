‘*After this*’—after the offering of the balls.

‘*The balls*’—that have been offered to the Pitṛs—‘he should make the
cow, etc. to eat.’ In the case of the fire, the ‘making to eat’ would
consist in their being thrown into the fire.

‘*Prāpayet*’ ( offer) is another reading for ‘*prāśayet*’ (make to
cat).—(260)
