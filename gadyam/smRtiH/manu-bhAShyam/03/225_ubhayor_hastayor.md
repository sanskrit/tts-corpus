<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The food should be *fetched* and *served* with both hands, not with one
hand, *serving* also being a kind of *fetching*; hence, the rule laid
down in connection with the latter is applicable to the former also. In
support of this, the present verse supplies a commendatory supplement.

That which is ‘*abandoned*’—not held—‘*by both hands*,’ such food, when
brought up for serving,—the ‘*demons destroy*’
‘*forcibly*,’—‘*wicked-minded*’—of malevolent nature;—‘*demons*’ *i.e*.,
the enemies of gods.

In ‘*ubhayoḥ*,’ ‘*both*,’ the Locative ending denotes location; and
‘*abandoned*’ means *not held*. As a matter of fact, case-endings are
used even when what is spoken of is the *negation* of what is denoted by
the ending; *e.g*., we have such expressions as ‘he does *not come from
the village*,’ ‘he does *not sit on the seat*,’ ‘he does *not fast for
three dags*.’ \[Similarly, in the text though *negation of holding* is
mentioned, yet we have the Locative ending denoting location\].—(225)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 439);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
1368), which explains the meaning as ‘the food that is not brought by
both hands is taken away by force’ (‘*sahasā*’) by the wicked
(*duṣṭacetasaḥ*) ‘Asuras’;—in ‘*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī*’ (p. 158), which
explains ‘*ubhayorhastayormuktam*’ as ‘(brought) with only one
hand’;—and in ‘*Gadādharapaddhati*’ (Kāla, p. 545).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.22).—‘One shall offer food to the Pitṛs, with both hands;
wicked-minded Asuras keep in waiting for the interval between the two
hands.’

*Maṭysapurāṇa* (quoted in Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 2370).—‘He
shall bring up the food, with both hands, then serve it, with a calm
mind, keeping in his hand water and kuśa.’

*Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa* (quoted in Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p.
2370).—‘Serving shall not be done at the Śrāddha with any article made
of iron, nor by one who is without the Pavitra and the kuśa, nor with
one hand.’
