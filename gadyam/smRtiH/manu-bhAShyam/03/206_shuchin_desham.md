**शुचिर्** भस्मास्थिकपालकाद्यनुपहतः । **विविक्तो** विस्तीर्णो बहुभिर् जनैर् अनाकीर्णः । **दक्षिणाप्रवणो** दक्षिणस्यां दिश्य् अवनतः । तादृशं देशं यत्नेन संपादयेत् । स्वभावतश् चेत् तादृशो न लभ्यते तथा कर्तव्यं यथा स्वव्यापारेण संपाद्यते । तं च गोशकृतोपलेपयेत् । मृदादयो निवर्तन्ते, गोमयेनोपलेपनियमात् ॥ ३.१९६ ॥

^(‘)*Clean*’— not defiled by the presence of ashes, bones, skulls, and
such things.

‘*Secluded*’—large and unoccupied by many men.

‘*Sloping towards the south*’—that which is of lower level on the
southern side. Such he should make the place, ‘*with care*.’ That is, if
one fails to find a spot that is not naturally so, one should make it
so, by one’s own effort.

This place he should smear with cowdung. This precludes the use of clay
and such things, the rule being that the smearing should be done with
cowdung.—(206)

This verse is quoted in ‘*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 652) in support of
the view that ‘even though it may not be possible for the performer to
find a spot sloping towards the south from himself, he should try and
make it slope southwards;’—in *Smṛtitattva* (page 107) in the sense that
the performer should sit on a place that has been previously smeared
with cowdung;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 483), which adds the following
explanations:—‘*shuchim*’—*i*.*e*., a sacred place, which is by itself
clean; or a place in his own house, which should be free from all
foreign sources of uncleanliness;—‘*viviktam*’ *i*.*e*., free from hairs
and other unclean things;—and the place should be beaten into a slope
towards the south—*i*.*e*., capable of allowing the performer to pour
offerings towards the south.

This is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 268);—in *Aparārka*, (p.
471), which explains ‘*vivikta*’ as ‘*vijana*,’ ‘not crowded by men;’
and adds that even though the place be clean, it should be smeared over
with cowdung for the purpose of imparting to it special sanctity;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 160);—and in *Śraddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 102).
