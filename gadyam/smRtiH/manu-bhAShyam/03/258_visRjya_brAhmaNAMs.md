The preceding verse was only by the way; the present verse takes up the
thread of the context.

‘*Dismissed*’—having permitted them to go wherever they please.

‘*Those Brāhmaṇas*’—who have dined.

After this, looking towards the southern direction, he should
‘*beg*’—ask for—the following ‘*boom*’—desirable things —‘*of his
ancestors*;’ thinking all the time of his ancestors. He should beg—with
such words as—‘may this and this be mine after you have been
satisfied.’—(258)

The next verse describes what the boons are that should he begged.

The second half of this verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 183), which
adds the following notes:—Vācaspati Miśra has explained this to mean
that ‘though actually facing the East, the man should, *in thought* face
the South’; but this is not right; as Gobhila has distinctly laid down
that the man should be actually facing the South.—Nor is there any
reason for taking the words of Manu in that sense; it is for this reason
that the commentators have explained the phrase ‘*dakṣiṇām
diśamākāṅkṣan*’ as ‘looking towards the South’.

The verse is quoted in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 207), which has the
following notes:—‘facing the East but looking sideways towards the
South’; Kullūka has explained ‘*ākāṅkṣan*’ as *looking towards*; but
such is not the meaning of the word;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
1483), which explains the meaning as—‘Dismissing them, to go their way,
rising and following them and bringing them to the place for washing the
feet, and then looking towards the South, should ask for the desired
boons.’

**(verses 3.258-259)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (73.27-30).—‘Pronouncing the name and the gotra, he shall offer
the *imperishable water*; then he shall address the words—*Viśvedevāḥ
priyantam*—to those facing the east; and then with joined hands and mind
calm and concentrated on them, he shall beg for the following
blessings—(Manu, 259 and the following) May we have much food! May we
have guests! May there be persons to beg from us! May we not beg of any
one!.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.246).—\[Reproduces Manu 259.\]
