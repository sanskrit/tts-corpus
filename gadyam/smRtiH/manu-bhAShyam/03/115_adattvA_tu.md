‘*Before giving food to these*’—*i.e*., to those just mentioned,
beginning with the guest and ending with the servant—‘*the foolish
man*’— who does not know the law—‘*eats*’— is devoured, after death, by
dogs and vultures.

This ‘*being devoured*’—being eaten—by them, he does not understand. The
foolish man simply feels that ‘I am eating now,’ and he does not
understand that his eating in this manner means the eating of his own
body by dogs and vultures. This latter is the result of such eating;
hence it has been thus described.—(115)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 455) without
comment; and also on p. 395, where it is explained as setting aside the
view that the *Vaiśvadeva* and *Bali* offerings should be made only once
in the morning when the man himself eats,—and as indicating the
necessity of making them both in the morning and in the evening, *even
though the man himself may not eat* at both times. There is this
difference, however, that if the man omits the offerings while he
himself eats, he incurs two sins—that of eating without offering, and
that of omitting the offerings; whereas if he drops them when he himself
does not eat, he incurs only one sin, that of omitting the offerings.
Thus on the *Ekādaśī* and other fasting days also, the said offerings
have got to be made; and food has got to be cooked for that purpose; but
in the event of his being unable to do the cooking, the offerings may be
made even with uncooked food.

This is quoted also in *Aparārka* (p. 147), which explains the second
line to mean ‘he does not understand that he is himself being devoured
by dogs and vultures’, and deduces the conclusion that it is not sinful
to eat along with the persons mentioned in the preceding verse.

*Viṣṇu* (67.40).—\[Reproduces Manu.\]

*Baudhāyana* (2.7.20).—‘If one eats before having fed these in the
proper manner, he is himself eaten; he does not eat; though he knows not
this.’

*Baudhāyana* (3.17.18).—‘They quote the following declaration made by
the Food:—If one eats rice without offering rice to the Pitṛs, the gods,
dependents, guests and friends, he eats poison; him I devour; for him I
am Death.’

*Viṣṇu-purāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 364).—‘If one eats before these have
been fed, he eats sin, and after death, he goes to hell and is born as a
feeder on phlegm.’

115	But the foolish man who eats first without having given food to these (persons) does, while he crams, not know that (after death) he himself will be devoured by dogs and vultures.
