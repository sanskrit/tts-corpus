The girl’s father, if wise, should not accept even a small consideration; by accepting a consideration, through greed, the man becomes a child-seller.—(51).

आसुरे शुल्कप्रतिषेधो ऽयम्, उत्तरत्र च कन्यार्थसंग्रहोपादानात् । **विद्वान्** ग्रहदोषज्ञः । कन्यापिता स्वल्पम् अप्य् अर्थं धनं न गृह्णीयात् । गृह्णानो ऽपत्यविक्रयदोषेण युज्यते । कः पुनर् एषः **शुल्को** नाम । आभाषणपूर्वं वराद् गृहीतम् । यत्र तूच्चनीचपणापणो भवति, कन्यागुणापेक्षमूल्यव्यवस्था, स क्रय एव । इह तु महागुणाया अपि कन्यायाः स्वल्पं धनम् । अनाभाषणपूर्वं वा ग्रहणम् । न विक्रयस्यैष धर्म इत्य् अतो विक्रयाध्यारोपेण निन्द्यते ॥ ३.५१ ॥

This verse prohibits the receiving ‘of consideration’ in connection with
the ‘Āsura’ form of marriage; that this is so, is indicated by the fact
that later on (in 54) the acceptance of a dowry for the bride is
permitted.

‘*Wise*’—*i.e*., knowing the impropriety of accepting the gift.

The girl’s father shall not accept even a small present; by accepting
it, he becomes tainted with the sin of child-selling.

“What is it that is called ‘*Śulka*,’ ‘consideration?’”

It is what is received from the bridegroom on stipulation. When there is
a bargaining, carried on in consideration of the good or bad qualities
of the bride,—it is a case of pure ‘selling;’ what is referred to here
is the acceptance of even a small present—though the bride is possessed
of most excellent qualities,—that also without any stipulation.

This (acceptance of unequal price) is not a condition of ‘sale’ proper;
the act is only deprecated by being described as being of the nature of
‘selling.’—(51)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 851), which
deduces from the word ‘*lobhena*,’ ‘through greed,’ the conclusion that
if something is received *without greed* on the part of the father, it
is not the ‘*price*,’ but only an *honorific present* to the bridegroom;
and in support of this it quotes Manu 3.54;—in *Vyāvahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*
(p. 761);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 232);—and by Jīmūtavāhana
(Dāyabhāga, p. 151).

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.21).—‘Those persons who, deluded by greed, give away
their daughters for a consideration, are soul-sellers, sinful and grave
sinners, and up to their seventh generation, they fall into hell.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.13.11).—‘In connection with marriage, a gift
to the girl’s guardian has been prescribed with a view to securing a
special end, and for a righteous purpose; therefore one should present
to the girl’s guardian a chariot and a hundred cows; which present joins
the couple in wedlock; the applying of the name *selling* to such giving
of the girl is a mere declamation; because the acceptance of the present
is for a righteous purpose.’

051	No father who knows (the law) must take even the smallest gratuity for his daughter; for a man who, through avarice, takes a gratuity, is a seller of his offspring.
