उपासनं तदभ्यासः । यो ब्राह्मणो ऽनयैव बुद्ध्या तत्र तत्रोपतिष्ठेत यथातिथिर् अवश्यं भोजनं लभेत तस्येयं निन्दा । यस् तच्छीलः **परस्य** संबन्धिनं **पाकम्** अन्नम् उपास्ते, न तु कदाचित् । **तेन** कर्मणा **प्रेत्य पशुतां** बलीवर्दादिजातिं **व्रजति** प्राप्नोति । **अन्नादिदायिनस्** तद्गृहे दन्तितां गर्दभताम् अश्वतां वा प्राप्नोति । गृहस्थस्यैष दोषः, उत्पन्नस्थालीपाकस्य ॥ ३.९४ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Waiting upon*’ means attending repeatedly. Some Brāhmaṇas wander from
house to house with a view to the fact that at such and such a house the
guest is sure to be fed; and it is this that is deprecated in the
present verse.

One who is in the habit of waiting upon the food cooked for others,—rand
not one who happens to do it only once by the way,—‘*on that
account*’—by reason of that act—‘*after death, cattle*’—are born as a
bull, &c., in the house of the ‘*givers of food*;’ *i.e*., are born as
his elephant, mule or horse.

This is a defect only in the Householder, who has established his own
domestic hearth.—(104)

*Yājñavalkya* (1.112).—‘One should not have a longing for food cooked in
