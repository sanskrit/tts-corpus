The term ‘*Suvāsinī*’ stands for newly married girls, daughters as well
as daughters-in-law. Others have held that ‘girls whose father-in-law
and father are both living are called *Suvāsinī*, even after they have
given birth to children.’

‘*These......immediately after the guests*’—in continuation of them—‘*he
should feed*.’ That is, as soon as the guests have commenced eating,
they should be fed at the same time.

Others read ‘*agre*’ ‘*before*’ (the guests).

‘*Without hesitation*’—*i.e*., he should not entertain any doubt as to
the propriety of feeding youngsters before the guests have eaten.—(114)

‘*Suvāsinīḥ*’—‘Newly married girls *i.e*., daughters and
daughters-in-law’ (Medhātithi);—‘women whose fathers and fathers-in-law
are living, even though they may have got children’ (‘others,’ quoted by
Medhātithi).

‘*Agre*’—‘Before (the guests)’ (Kullūka);—Medhātithi adopts the reading
‘*anvak*’ and explains it to mean ‘along with (the guests)’; and not as
‘even if they come later,’ as Hopkins interprets him.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 455), which explains
‘*agre*’ as ‘first’;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 147).
