‘*Lawful*’—that which is not fallen from the law; *i.e*., prescribed by
the scriptures.

‘*What are the good and bad points of each form*’—*i.e*., which points
in each are conducive to desirable and which to undesirable results.

‘*Offspring*’—*i.e*., in the birth of children.

‘*Good effects*’—good qualities. ‘*Bad effects*’—defects. In reality,
the ‘good and bad effects,’ in the form of Heaven and Hell, pertain to
the bridegroom; but here they stand for that which brings about these
effects.

Though this is already implied in what has gone before (in the first
line), yet it is mentioned again for the purpose of making the idea
clearer.—(22)
