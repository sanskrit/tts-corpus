As many Brāhmaṇas the officiator at the sacrifices performed by Śūdras may happen to touch with his limbs,—the reward relating to charity in connection with the gift to so many Brāhmaṇas fails to accrue to the giver.—(178)

As many Brāhmaṇas he may happen to touch with his limbs,—when he happens
to enter the same line with them;—here also the actual touching of the
body is not meant; mere presence at the place is meant.

‘*Reward relating to charity*’—*i.e*., the rewards that follow from
gifts made outside the ‘sacrificial altar.—(178)

‘*Paurtikam*’—‘Rewards that follow from gifts made outside the
sacrificial altar’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘the gift of food at a
Śrāddha’ (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 454);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 498).

*Viṣṇu* (82.14).—‘Those who sacrifice for the Śūdra (should be
avoided).’

*Bṛhad-Yama-Smṛti* (35, 37, 38).—‘The ill-visaged, the eunuch, the
heretic, the decrier of the Veda, the sophist, the sacrificer for the
Śūdra, and those who sacrifice for improper persons,—these should be
avoided with great care at the Śrāddha.’

178	The giver (of a Sraddha) loses the reward, due for such a non-sacrificial gift, for as many Brahmanas as a (guest) who sacrifices for Sudras may touch (during the meal) with his limbs.
