पूर्वस्य प्रतिषेधस्य शेषो ऽयं निन्दार्थवादः । **हीनजातिः** शूद्रैव, तस्या एव प्रकृतत्वात्, **ससंतानानि शूद्रताम्** इति निगमनात् । त एते **द्विजातयः मोहाद्** धनलोभजाद् अविवेकात् कामनिमित्तत्वाद् वा **कुलानि शूद्रतां** गमयन्ति । तस्यां जाताः पुत्राः शूद्रा भवन्त्य् एवं तत्पुत्रपौत्रा इति । अथ उच्यते **ससंतानानीति** । संतानो ऽपत्योत्पत्तिप्रबन्धः पुत्रपौत्रादिः ॥ ३.१५ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is a deprecatory exhortation, supplementing the foregoing
prohibition.

‘*Of the lout caste*’—*i.e*., of the Śūdra caste; the *Śūdra girl* being
the subject of consideration; and further, because the statement ends
with the assertion that the families along with offspring are reduced to
the position *of the Śūdra*.

‘*The twice-born men*, *through infatuation*’—*i.e*., on account of
folly arising from greed for wealth, or from lust,—‘*reduce their
families to the position of the Śūdra*.’ That is, sons born of that wife
become *Śūdras*, and so also grandsons and great-grandsons descended
from them. Hence, it is added—‘*along with their offspring*’—the term
‘*offspring*’ standing for the line of descendants, consisting of sons,
grandsons, &c.—(15).

prohibiting the marrying of a *Śūdra* wife by the twice-born;—in
