From out of the material that had been held in the vessel, and out of
which the fire-oblations have been offered,—‘*having made three bails*,’
turning bis face towards the South, he should ‘*offer them*’—*i.e*.,
throw them on the *kuśa-grass*, with reference to the Pitṛs.

The term ‘*piṇḍa*,’ ‘ball,’ stands for something *solid*; hence, one
should not, in this connection, offer disintegrated articles of food.

‘*In the manner of the water-libations*’—*i.e*., the manner of offering
water-libations, which has been just pointed out (in the preceding
verse).

In this connection, the following question arises:—“Should the
purificatory rites necessary for the sacrificial material be performed
over the substance taken out of the food that has been cooked for
feeding the Brāhmaṇas?—or, should separate rice be cooked?—and also what
should be the quantity of that sacrificial material? The rule laying
down ‘four handfulls’ cannot apply to this case.”

This question has been already discussed; in the absence of any specific
rules on the subject, one is free to do what one likes; and the quantity
should be just what may be necessary for the purpose in view.

Inasmuch as ‘the manner of the water-libations’ is laid down as
applicable to the offering of balls, it follows that this latter
offering is to be done with ‘hands in the *apasavya* position,’ and not
with silver implements.

‘*With collected mind*’—this has been added for the purpose of filling
up the metre.—(215)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 601), without any
comment;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1427), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Tasmāt haviḥśeṣāt*’, out of the remnant of the substance
offered into the Fire,—‘*audakavidhi*’ stands for the method by which an
offering of water is made with hands in the *Apasavya* form, as laid
down in the preceding verse.

*Viṣṇu* (73.17-19).—‘Near the food-remnant, upon kuśa-blades pointing
southwards, he shall deposit one ball for his father, with the mantra
*Pṛthivī darvirakṣitā*, etc.;—the second to the grand-father, with the
mantra *Antarikṣam darvirakṣitā*, etc.; the third to the
great-grand-father, with the mantra *Dyaurdarviraksiṭā*, *etc*.’

215	But having made three cakes out of the remainder of that sacrificial food, he must, concentrating his mind and turning towards the south, place them on (Kusa grass) exactly in the same manner in which (he poured out the libations of) water.
