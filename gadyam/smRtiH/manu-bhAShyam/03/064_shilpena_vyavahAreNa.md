By (practising) handicrafts, by pecuniary transactions, by (begetting) children on Sudra females only, by (trading in) cows, horses, and carriages, by (the pursuit of) agriculture and by taking service under a king.—(64)


(Note: the above is an alternate translation by George Bühler)


Verses 57—66 are omitted by Medhātithi. [Query—are they interpolations?] “These are very probably a later addition. The corresponding section in the Mahābhārata, 13.46 stops right here also.”—Hopkins. They are all quoted in Vivādaratnākara and in Parāśaramādhava.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 589) as setting
forth further causes for the degradation of a Brāhmaṇa family;—also in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 676) to the same effect;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 208), which explains that the *selling* of ‘cows’ and
‘horses’ is what is meant here.

**(verses 3.64-66)  
**

*Baudhāyana* (1.5.84).—‘Through cows, houses and conveyances, through
agriculture and through serving the king, families cease to be families;
as also those that are devoid of the Veda; those families on the other
hand that are rich in the Veda,—even though possessed of little wealth,
come to be numbered among families and acquire great fame.’
