At a Śrāddha one should not feed a friend; his acquisition shall be made by means of riches. At a Śrāddha one should feed him whom he regards neither as friend nor as foe.—(138)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Even when endowed with the aforesaid qualifications of ‘Vedic learning’
and the rest, the man shall not be fed on account of his being a friend;
this is the prohibition contained in this verse.

‘*A* *friend*’—one whose happiness and unhappiness are the same as one’s
own, and who is in no way different from himself,—‘*one should not feed
at a Śrāddha*.’

‘*By means of riches*’— by means of other kinds of gifts—‘the
acquisition’ of the friend should be made; his friendship obtained; or
the benefit of ‘friendship’ may consist in *non-separation*.

It is not only the friend that one shall not feed; the enemy also should
not be fed. ‘*Him whom he regards neither as friend* *nor* *as foe*,’—
towards whom one eutertains feelings of neither affection, nor aversion:
in regard to whom there could be no suspicion of any relationship due to
affection or any other motive; the mention of the ‘friend or foe’ being
only illustrative. It is on account of the suspicion of such
relationship that the maternal grandfather and others have been
mentioned (in 147, 148 below) as secondary alternatives.

“There is possibility of the enemy being fed only where one wishes make
a friend of him; hence he also being included under ‘friend’ (should not
have been mentioned separately).”

The separate mention is expected to make the matter dearer.—(138)

*Gautama* (15).—‘He should not behave towards him as towards a friend.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (17.4).—‘He shall feed such Brāhmaṇas... as are
not related to him either through otra or through marriage or through
Vedic learning or through discipleship.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.8.6).—‘Such as are not related to him through the Veda.’

*Vaśiṣṭha*. (11.14).—‘During the darker fortnight, after the fourth day,
he shall make offerings to the Pitṛs; having, on the previous day, got
together such Brāhmaṇas as are renunciates or hermits or are old, not
engaged in any improper profession, learned in the Veda,—but who are not
his own pupils or disciples. But he shall feed even his disciples, if
they are endowed with exceptional qualities.’

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 137.44).—‘One who has offered the Śrāddha
shall not receive a friend; for the purpose of making friends he shall
make presents of riches; in connection with the offerings to gods and
Pitṛs, he shall feed one who is neutral, whom he regards neither as a
friend nor as a foe.’

*Kaśyapa* (Aparārka, p. 448).—‘Enemies...... should not be invited at

138	Let him not entertain a personal friend at a funeral sacrifice; he may gain his affection by (other) valuable gifts; let him feed at a Sraddha a Brahmana whom he considers neither as a foe nor as a friend.
