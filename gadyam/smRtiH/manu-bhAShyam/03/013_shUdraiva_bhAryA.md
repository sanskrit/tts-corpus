For the Śūdra, the Śūdra girl. alone has been ordained to be the wife; for the Vaiśya, she as also the girl of his own caste; for the Kṣatriya, those two as also the girl of his own caste; and for the Brāhmaṇa those three as also the girl of his own caste—(13).

There being a distinction of castes, ‘one’s own caste’ constitutes the
(upward) limit. Just as for the Brāhmaṇa, there are Kṣatriya and other
wives, so it would seem as if for the Śūdra also there would be wives
belonging to the lower orders of ‘washer-woman and carpenter.’ In order
to preclude this possibility, the text lays down the restriction that
the *Śūdra* can have a wife from his own caste only. A wife of the
higher caste is precluded by the qualifying phrase, ‘in due order,’ in
the preceding verse.

‘*She*’—*i.e*., the Śūdra woman—‘*and girl of his own caste*’—*i.e*.,
the Vaiśya woman—‘for the Vaiśya.’

‘*Those two*’—the Vaiśya woman and the Śūdra woman,—‘*and* *the girl of
his own caste*’— ‘*for the Kṣatriya*.’

Similarly, ‘*for the Brāhmaṇa*.’

The right order would appear to be that the verse should begin with the
‘*Brāhmaṇa*,’ but it begins with the ‘*Śūdra*’ which only goes to lend
strength to the aforesaid notion (that a wife of the higher class is not
permitted).

In this connection, it has been declared that ‘what is meant by the text
is that there should be *option* in order, and not a combination of all
(the several kinds of wives).’—(13)

Hopkins compares this with the Mahābhārata 13, 47. 8.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 404) as an
amplification of what has been declared in the latter half of the
preceding verse;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 740) along with the
preceding verse; and in *Aparārka*, (p. 88), which adds that what is
stated hero is permissible only in the case of people moved by lust, and
not of those who are subject to righteousness; so that these are to be
regarded as ‘inferior—‘*Kramaśaḥ*’ (verse 12) in due order, not in any
topsy-turvy ‘order—in *Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 3), which observes that the
*eva* in ‘*śūdraiva*’ is meant to preclude marriage of the ‘inverse’
order;—*i.e*., where the bridegroom’s caste is lower than that of the
bride;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 206), which adds that this
pertains to marriage for pleasure’s sake.
