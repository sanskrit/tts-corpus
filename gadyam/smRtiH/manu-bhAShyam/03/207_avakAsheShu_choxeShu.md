‘*Avakāśa*,’ is *place, spot*.

‘*Cokṣa*’—naturally clean and tending to mental calm; such as forests,
etc.

‘*Water-banks*’— sand-banks, near rivers.

‘*Secluded places*’—uncrowded sacred places.

This verse contains a totally different injunction. Hence, in the case
of such places, the rule regarding *smearing with cowdung* does not
apply; because the rule (in the preceding verse) distinctly says that
‘one should make it so;’ which means that the rule applies to a place
where *cleanness* has to be brought about. In regard to places that are
naturally clean, their fitness is secured by ‘being examined and
sprinkled with water.’

By the Śrāddha ‘*offered*’— performed—in such places, the Pitṛs become
greatly pleased.—(207)

‘*Cokṣesu*’—‘ Naturally clean’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Nārāyaṇa);—and ‘pleasing’ (Nandana and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 471), which explains ‘*cokṣa*’ as
a ‘place that is naturally clean’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 160);—and
in *Śrāddhakriyākaumndī* (p. 102).

*Viṣṇu* (85.54-61).—‘On large rivers, on all natural spots, on
river-banks, on streams, on hills, in groves, in forests, in parks.’

*Yama* (*Aparārka* p. 471).—‘Śrāddhas should be offered in sacred
buildings, on river-banks, in Tīrthas, and on one’s own land, in groves
near hills, and on mountain-tops.’
