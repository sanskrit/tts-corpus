Just as the living father is fed, so is the grandfather also.

Having sought permission from the grandfather, the man himself may
perform the *śrāddha*; *i.e*., he should make the offering to the two
remoter ancestors, or to the great-grandfather only. This is what is
implied by the terms ‘*may*’ and ‘*according to his will*.’—(222)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

The first half of this verse is quoted without comment in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 542);—also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 362);—and in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 554), which notes that ‘*Śrāddham*’ stands for
the ‘Śrāddha-oflferings,’ the things offered; as the ‘*Śrāddha*’ itself
cannot be eaten, the meaning is that the living grandfather should be
fed on the substances offered at the Śrāddhas, and then the offerings
made to the dead Father and Great-grandfather.
