The houses on which female relations, not being duly honoured, pronounce a curse, perish completely, as if destroyed by magic.—(58)


(Note: the above is an alternate translation by George Bühler)


Verses 57—66 are omitted by Medhātithi. [Query—are they interpolations?] “These are very probably a later addition. The corresponding section in the Mahābhārata, 13.46 stops right here also.”—Hopkins. They are all quoted in Vivādaratnākara and in Parāśaramādhava.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 506); in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 417);—and in *Aparārka* (p. 107), which explains
‘*Jāmayaḥ*’ as, ‘*bhaginyaḥ*’ and adds that it includes the daughter,
daughter-in-law and others.
