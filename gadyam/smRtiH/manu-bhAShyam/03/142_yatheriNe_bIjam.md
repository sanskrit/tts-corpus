Just as having sown the seed in barren soil, the sower reaps no harvest,—even so, having given the offerings to one ignorant of the Veda, the giver obtains no reward.—(142)

‘*Barren soil*’—Unproductive ground. that plot of land is called
‘barren’ on which if seed is sown, it does not sprout; there the ‘*sower
reaps no harvest*.’

‘*Even so*,’ ‘*to the person ignorant of die Veda*’—‘*having given the
offerings* made to gods and ancestors,—‘*the giver obtains no reward*.’

The term ‘*anṛce*’ is with the Locative ending; and the term ‘*ṛk*’
stands for the *Veda* in general.—(142)

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 90.45).—‘As seed sown in barren soil does not
germinate and the sower does not reap even a part of the seed, so also
the Śrāddha partaken of by undeserving persons confers no benefits
either here or elsewhere.’

142	As a husbandman reaps no harvest when he has sown the seed in barren soil, even so the giver of sacrificial food gains no reward if he presented it to a man unacquainted with the Rikas.
