‘*Friend*’— Companion; they of whom the friend is the first. The term
‘*and the rest*’ connotes *kind*, and includes relations, associates,
class-fellows, and so forth;—all except the Teacher.

‘*That may come out of affection*,’—The context pertaining to the
*guest*, the term ‘*affection*,’ has been added with a view to preclude
that character.

‘*He should feed them*.’

‘*Specially prepared*’—Having cooked the food with special care.

‘*To the best of his ability*;’—the term ‘ability’ is meant to be merely
illustrative; the meaning is that the cooking and the seasoning should
be in accordance with the man’s own ability, and also according to what
each guest may deserve.

‘*Together with his wife*’—the time for the wife’s eating is the same as
the husband’s; no time being laid down specifically for the wife; all
that is said is that ‘the husband and Wife should eat the remnant’
(verse 116). In the Mahābhārata, however, it is shown that the wife eats
after the husband: In the course of conversation between Draupadī and
Satyabhāmā, Draupadī, describing the duties of the wife, has said—‘after
all my husbands have eaten, I eat what is left’. The eating of food left
by the husband is among the wife’s duties. Hence, what is here laid down
is not that the Friend and others should eat at the time that, the wife
eats; nor does the phrase ‘*along with*’ mean that, they are to eat out
of the same dish. All that is, meant is that they should not be fed
alone; the housewife also should eat there. This might go against the
rule that ‘the husband and wife should eat what is left,’ What is meant
is that if some respectable person is to be waited for, or if the
husband feels disinclined to eat, then the husband may not eat with the
Friend, etc., and in his place his wife should eat; this will bear
testimony to his friendly feelings towards the diners.—(113)

This verse is quoted without comment in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
394);—and in *Aparārka* (p. 154) as laying down the treatment to be
accorded to such relations and friends as happen to arrive after the
Householder himself has eaten,—and as implying that the wife should eat
*after* the husband has eaten.
