Extremely small portions—parts of the ball offered to the Father should
be made to be eaten by the Brāhmaṇa who has been previously seated in
honour of the Father.

‘*In due order of sequence*’;—the meaning of this has been already
explained.

The pronoun ‘those’ refers to those mentiond in the present context;
and, it is in view of this that, in 212, our author has not thought it
necessary to specify the Brāhmaṇa as the one thus mentioned.

‘*Frst*’—*i.e*., before every other kind of food.—(219).

‘*Vidhivat*’—‘Giving to the Brāhmaṇa invited in honour of the Father a
piece out of the Ball offered to the Father, and so forth’
(Kullūka);—‘after they have sipped water, and so forth’ (Nārāyaṇa).

“Nandana inserts here verse 223 and states that it is explanatory of the
term ‘according to rule.’”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 326);—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 1476).

*Matsya-Purāṇa* (quoted in *Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-*Śrāddha, p.
24-76).—‘Having taken, in due order, portions out of the balls, the man
shall, with due care, have them eaten by those same Brāhmaṇas. Having at
first placed in their hands the pavitra-kuśa along with water and
sesamum, he shall offer the portions of the balls, saying
*svadhaiṣāmastu*.’

219	But taking successively very small portions from the cakes, he shall make those seated Brahmana eat them, in accordance with the rule, before (their dinner).
