The author now proceeds to show the purpose why he has provided a
classification of the qualities.

Offerings made to the Pitṛs are called ‘*Kavya*;’ these should be
‘*presented*’—given—‘*to those excelling in learning*.’

‘*Carefully*’—implies that if one does not take special care, these
also, like the offering to gods, should be given to all the four.

For the offerings to Pitṛs the best recipients are those excelling in
learning,—it having been declared that ‘he is the recipient among
recipients.’

What the verse means is that food in general should be given to all the
four, without any distinction.

‘*Law*’— Rule laid down in the scriptures.—(135)

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.7.4, 22).—‘One shall feed such Brāhmaṇas as
are well versed in the Veda; also one who is studying the Veda, the son
of an expounder of the Veda, and one learned in the Veda; when these eat
at a Śrāddha, they purify the line of feeders.’

*Gautama* (15.9, 10).—‘Vedic scholars, endowed with beauty, age and
character; the first offer should be made to the younger men.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1. 219).—‘One who is foremost in all the Vedas, one
learned in the Veda, the young man knowing Brahman, one who knows the
meaning of the Veda, the *Jyeṣṭhasāman*, the *Trimadhu* and the
*Trisuparṇaka*.’

*Viṣṇu-Smṛti* (83, 19, 21).—‘Specially the Yogins. May such a one bo
born in our family as may feed at the Śrāddha the Brāhmaṇa who is a
Yogin! By that would we be fully satisfied.’

*Mahābhārata* (13. 90. 51).—\[Reproduces the first half of Manu.\]
