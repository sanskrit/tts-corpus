A Brāhmaṇa should not advertise his family and Gotra for the purpose of obtaining a meal. Bragging about these, for the purpose of obtaining a meal, he comes to be called a “feeder on filth” by the wise.—(109)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse contains an advice offered, by the way, to the guest.

Seeking for food, he shall not say—‘I belong to such and such a family,
I am the son of so and son; in this fashion he shall not advertise his
‘family or *gotra*.’ The ‘*family*’ consists of his father, grandfather,
and so forth;—‘*gotra*’—may stand either for such Ṛṣi-names as
‘*Garga*,’ ‘*Bhārgava*,’ etc.; or for one’s *name*. That the term
‘*gotra*’ means *name* also is shown by such usage as ‘mistake in
names,’ ‘*gotraskhalita*’ which term is used in the event of a man
pronouncing a name other than the one he intended to pronounce.

His ‘learning’ also he should not advertise; as this also has been
prohibited in another *Smṛti*.

The Text adds a declamatory, assertion:—‘*For the purpose of obtaining a
meal*’—*i.e*., with the motive that by advertising my family and *gotra*
I shall succeed in obtaining a meal, if one brags about these—*family
and gotra*,—he is called by the wise ‘*Vāntāśin*,’ ‘*feeder-on
filth*,’—he who swallows what has been vomitted.—(109)

This verse is quoted^ in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 358) in support of
the view that ‘just as the host should not enquire after the *gotra* and
other details regarding the guest, so the guest also should not declare
these’;—and in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 426) without comment.

*Baudhāyana* (Parāśaramadhava, p. 357).—‘If one offers food after asking
about country, name, family and learning,—he does not obtain the reward
of that act, and does not go to heaven.’

*Parāśara* (1.405).—‘If one offers food after making enquiries regarding
the name, the family and the learning of the guest, he does not obtain
its reward, nor does he go to heaven.’

*Parāśara* (1.48).—‘One should not ask the guest his *gotra* or Vedic
text, nor the extent of his knowledge of Veda or learning; one should
think of him as the god, since he embodies all the gods.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 357).—‘One shall not ask his *gotra* or
Vedic text, or country or family or name or learning—when a Brāhmaṇa
traveller arrives seeking for food.’

*Viṣṇu-purāṇa* (Do.)—‘The householder shall honour the guest as
Hiraṇyagarbha, not asking him about his study, *gotra*, Vedic text or
family.’

109	A Brahmana shall not name his family and (Vedic) gotra in order to obtain a meal; for he who boasts of them for the sake of a meal, is called by the wise a foul feeder (vantasin).
