What is given to the Soma-seller becomes ordure; to the physician, pus and blood; that to the temple-attendant becomes lost; and that to the usurer has no place.—(180)

तस्यां जातौ जायते यत्र **विष्ठास्य** भोजनं भवति । एवं **भिषजे** । **नष्टं** निष्फलम् उद्वेगकरं वा । नष्टं हि द्रव्यं उद्वेगं जनयति । अविद्यमाना प्रतिष्ठा स्थितिर् यस्य तद् **अप्रतिष्ठम्** । नानारूपैः शब्दैर् एवंविधस्य दानस्य नैष्फल्यम् कर्तुश् च दोषसंबन्धः प्रतिपाद्यते । **नष्टम् अप्रतिष्ठम्** इति नानयोर् अर्थाभेदशङ्का कार्या, कार्यविभेदात् ॥ ३.१७० ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The sense is that the man becomes born in that species of creatures
where ordure is eaten.

Similarly, with the physician.

‘*Becomes lost*’—*i.e*., fruitless; or source of anxiety; anything that
is ‘lost’ becomes a source of anxiety.

That which has no place, no existence at all, is called ‘*apratiṣṭham*.’

Various forms of expression have been used here to show the
fruitlessness of the gift and also the evils attaching to the giver. The
terms ‘*lost*’ and ‘*without place*’ should not be regarded as
synonymous, as there is a distinct difference in their effects.—(180)

What is meant is that ‘the man will be born as an animal feeding upon
the things specified’ (according to Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—that ‘the food will be rejected by the Pitṛs and Gods, as
impure’ (according to Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Apratiṣṭham*’—‘Has no place’ (Medātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghvānanda);—‘secures no fame to the giver’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 454).

*Mahābhārata* (13.90, 13, 14).—‘What is given to the Soma-seller and to
the physician becomes pus and blood; what is given to the temple-servant
perishes; it is neither here nor there.’

180	(Food) given to a seller of Soma becomes ordure, (that given) to a physician pus and blood, but (that presented) to a temple-priest is lost, and (that given) to a usurer finds no place (in the world of the gods).
