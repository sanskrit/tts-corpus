Being happy himself, he shall bring delight to the Brāhmaṇas; he shall feed them, gently and slowly, with dishes, and urge them repeatedly by means of seasonings.—(233)

Even if he has cause for grief, he should not show it, by heaving a
sigh, or in any other way; in fact, he should show himself quite happy.

‘*He should bring delight to the Brāhmaṇas*’—by means of songs and such
things sung by other persons; or, by means of such jokes as may be not
improper and be in keeping with the occasion. If the reciting of Vedic
texts were continued unceasingly, the Brāhmaṇas might begin to feel
bored; hence, now and again, he should cease and amuse the guests by
means of music, etc.

‘*He should feed them gently*;’—he should make them eat by addressing to
them such agreeable words as ‘Do take a few morsels, this dish is nice;’
and this should be done ‘*gently*’—not in a hurried or pressing
tone;—‘*with dishes*’—such as milk-rice, and the like.

‘*By means of seasonings*,’—when the seasonings are taken up for being
served, he should describe them as very tasty and thereby tempt the
guests to eat; saying such words as—‘these cakes are delicious, this
preparation of milk is highly flavoured;’ and taking the things in hand
and standing before each guest, he shall say such words again and again.
This is what constitutes ‘urging.’—(233)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1026), which has the
following notes:—‘*Tūṣṭaḥ*,’—even though he may have real cause for
grief, he should not show it by sighs or other expressions, he should
show himself happy; ‘*Brāhmaṇān harṣayet*’ with singing and other things
done by others,—or by himself, in due conformance with propriety, or
with jokes suggested by the occasion; the meaning is that if the invited
appear to become bored by the long-continued recitation of Vedic hymns
*&c*., he should amuse them by means of stories of heroic deeds or songs
and the like;—‘*Shanairbhojayet*,’ should feed them with such gentle
persuasive expressions as ‘this is very tasty, do please take a few
morsels’ and so forth;—‘*annādyena*’ milk-rice and such
foods,—‘*guṇaiḥ*’, vegetables,—‘*asakṛt*,’ again and again;
‘*parichodayet*,’ should urge, with such words as ‘these cakes are very
nice, this preparation of milk is very tasty’, ‘taking each thing in his
hand, he should stand before the invited, and repeat the persuasion
again and again,—this is what is meant by ‘urging.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 1028).—‘Describing the
qualities of the dishes, he shall feed the Brāhmaṇas slowly, and shall
delight them with Ākhyānas, Itihāsas and Pūrvavṛttas.’

*Yama* (Do.).—\[Repeats the second line of Manu.\]

233	Himself being delighted, let him give delight to the Brahmanas, cause them to partake gradually and slowly (of each dish), and repeatedly invite (them to eat) by (offering) the food and (praising) its qualities.
