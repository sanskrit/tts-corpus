<u>विदुषे</u> या दक्षिणा दीयते सा दातॄन् फलभागिनः कुरुते इति युक्तम् । प्रतिग्रहीतारस् तु कतरत् फलं भुञ्जते । यदि तावद् अदृष्टम्, तद् अयुक्तम् अनोदितत्वात् प्रतिग्रहस्य दृष्टफललाभेन प्रवृत्तेः । अथ दृष्टम्, तद् अविदुषो ऽपि दृश्यते । 

- <u>सत्यम्</u> । प्रशंसैषा । ईदृशम् एतद् विदुषे दानं यत् प्रतिग्रहीताप्य् अदृष्टफलभाग् भवेत् । सत्य् अपि दृष्टे किं पुनर् दातेति ।

That the gift that is presented to the learned person makes the *givers*
partakers of reward is only right: but what is the reward obtained by
the receivers? If it be held that they obtain some transcendental
result,—that, cannot be right: because the act of *receiving* gifts has
not been so enjoined, and also because the receiver is prompted to
accept the gift only with a view to the perceptible reward. If, on the
other hand, the reward to the *receiver* be held to be something
perceptible,—then such a reward is found to be obtained by the ignorant
person also.”

True; but what is stated here is mere praise; the sense lasing that—‘the
presenting of offerings to the learned man is so effective that the
*receiver* also comes to partake of the imperceptible reward, in
addition to the perceptible one,—what to say of the *giver*.’

‘*Alter death*’— in heaven.

‘*Here*’—the reward is in the form of fame; the man being praised by men
as doing things in exact accordance with the scriptures,

‘*According to rule*;’—this is a mere reiterative reference to the
injunction that ‘gifts should be made to persons posessing such and such
qualifications.’—(143)

them, long life, offspring, wealth, learning, heaven, final deliverance
and pleasures.’

143	But a present made in accordance with the rules to a learned man, makes the giver and the recipient partakers of rewards both in this (life) and after death.
