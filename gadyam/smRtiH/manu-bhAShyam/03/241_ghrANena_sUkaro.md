The pig defiles by sniffing, the cock by wind raised by its wings, the dog by casting his eye, and the man born of the low caste by touch.—(241).

The cock defiles by the wind raised by its wings.

The meaning of this verse has already been explained above (under 239);
the sense is that the proximity of these should be avoided up to such
distance that they may not be able to see the performance.

‘*The man born of the low caste*’—here meant is the *Cāṇḍāla*; as it is
this that has been spoken of above.

It has been already explained above that the actions of *touching* and
the rest stand here for the action that has been mentioned above (in
239), and not for these actions themselves. For this reason, there is no
room for the following criticism.—“The touch of the *Cāṇḍāla* being
already prohibited generally, there could be no possibility of such
touching, and hence the prohibition here contained becomes superfluous;
hence the ‘man born of the low caste’ must be taken as the *Śūdra*; and
what is prohibited is the Śūdra touching the *Śrāddha*, etc., offered by
twice-born men, but not those performed by himself.”

Even if the actions of *touching*, etc., stand for themselves,—what is
meant is not that evil results from the Cāṇḍāla touching the articles of
food and drink, but that he should not touch the unsheltered spot on the
river-bank and such other places that has been selected for the
performance; as the impurity caused by such contact has been described
as removed by wind and fire. And thus, inasmuch as the touch of such
persons would be quite possible (under the circumstances just
described), it is only right that it should be prohibited.—(241)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 472), which explains
‘*avaravarṇajaḥ*’ as ‘Śūdra’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 576);—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 521), which explains ‘*avaraja*’ as Śūdra,
and explains the meaning to be that ‘the things should be removed far
enough so that the wind etc. may not reach the food.’

241	A boar makes (the rite) useless by inhaling the smell (of the offerings), a cock by the air of his wings, a dog by throwing his eye (on them), a low-caste man by touching (them).
