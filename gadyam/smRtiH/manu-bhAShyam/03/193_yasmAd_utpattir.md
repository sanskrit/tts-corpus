He from whom these—Pitṛs—‘*have their origin*,’ and ‘*who*’—which
Pitṛs—‘*have to be worshipped by whom*,’ *i.e*., the ‘Somapa’ Manes by
*Brāhmaṇas*, the ‘*Haviṣmat*’ Pitṛs by *Kṣatriyas*, and so forth;—all
this ‘*learn fully*,’ as described now.

‘*Rules*;’—this is a mere reiterative reference; the rules having been
already laid down in the words, ‘one should remain self-controlled, &c.,
&c.’ The plural number is due to there being a large number of
rules.—(193)
