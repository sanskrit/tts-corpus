वृषलीशब्दः स्त्रीमात्रोपलक्षणार्थः, सामान्येन ब्रह्मचर्यस्य विधानात् । अतो ब्राह्मण्य् अपि वृषल्य् एव । वृषस्यति चालयति भर्तारम् इति यौगिकत्वं दर्शयति । अतो ऽयम् अर्थः । भोजनम् अङ्गीकृत्य तदहः यः स्त्रिया **सह मोदते** रमते, तया सह सुरतसंभोगेच्छया संलापालिङ्गनाद्य् अपि यो जनयति, तस्यायं दोषः । **दातुः** श्राद्धस्य कर्तुः, **यद् दुष्कृतं** पापं **किंचित्** **तत् सर्वं** तस्मिन् संक्रामति । अनिष्टफलयोगमात्रम् अनेन निर्दिश्यते । अन्यथा यत्र दाता पुण्यकृत् तत्र न कश्चिद् दोषः स्यात् । मोदनं हर्षोत्पत्तिः । तेन संलापालिङ्गनाद्य् अपि न कर्तव्यम् ॥ ३.१८१ ॥

The term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ here stands for *woman* in general; this is
indicated by the fact that the invitee has been advised to observe
strict *continence* (and not only avoidance of improper intercourse).
Hence, in the present context, the Brāhmaṇa woman also is a ‘*vṛṣalī*;’
the term (in this sense) being etymologically explained as ‘she who
tempts her husband’ (*bhartāram vṛṣasyati*). Tims, what the passage
means is as follows:—Having accepted invitation, if the man dallies with
a woman,—*i.e*., with a view to having sexual intercourse with her,
engages in such nets as conversation, embracing, and so forth,—then he
incurs the following evil: whatever sin there might be in the ‘giver,’
*i.e*., the performer of the *Śrāddha*—passes on to him. What this
indicates is the coming about of undesirable results; if this were not
what is meant, then it would mean that there is nothing wrong in doing
this, in a case where the giver is a sinless person.

‘*Dallying*’ stands for obtaining pleasure; hence it follows that one
should not do even such acts as conversation, embracing, and the
like.—(191)

‘*Vṛṣalī*’—‘Woman in general’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Nandana and
Rāghavānanda);—‘a Śūdra woman’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 702), where it
apparently takes the term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ as standing for the Śūdra
woman;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1006), which adds the following
notes—‘*vṛṣalī*’ stands here for *woman in general*,—the Brāhmaṇī also
is a ‘*vṛṣalī*’ in the sense that she ‘hankers after the male’
(*vṛṣasyati bhartāram*); hence the meaning is that ‘if after having
accepted the invitation, one enjoys the company of his wife he incurs
sin,’—‘*modate*’ means *enjoying*, hence conversing and embracing also
are to be avoided,—‘*dātuḥ*,’ of the performer of the
Śrāddha,—‘*duṣkṛtam*’ sin,—becomes transferred to the said transgressor,
*i.e*., some disagreeable results accrue to him. If the words were to be
taken in the literal sense then there could be nothing wrong in eases
where the inviter is a pure, sinless man.

*Gautama* (15.22).—‘He who has just taken part in a Śrāddha,—if he takes
to his bed a Śūdra woman, he throws his forefathers into her ordure for
three months.’

191	But he who, being invited to a Sraddha, dallies with a Sudra woman, takes upon himself all the sins which the giver (of the feast) committed.
