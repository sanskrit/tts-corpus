‘*Evening*’—is the time of sunset, the beginning of night. At that time
if a guest arrives, he ‘*should not be driven away*’ he should not be
refused admission; *i.e*., he should be entertained with food, bed,
seat, and so forth.—“By whom *?*”—‘*By the householder*’—‘*medha*’ means
*sacrifice*; ‘*gṛhamedha*’ is the name applied to the Five Great
Sacrifices; one who is entitled to these is the ‘*gṛhamedhin*,’ the
Householder.

‘*Brought by the sun*’—this is purely laudatory. ‘*Brought*’—made to
arrive—‘*by the sun*.’ Being brought by a god, he certainly deserves
honour.

‘*In time*’—*i.e*., the second part of the day; the time at which the
Vaiśvadeva offerings are made. ‘*Not in time*’—in the evening; after
breakfast has been finished.

‘*He should not stay in his*’— the householder’s—‘*house, without taking
food*.’ If there is any food left, that should be offered to him; if
not, food should be cooked afresh.—(105)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 351), which
explains ‘*Sūryoḍha*’ as ‘one who has been brought to the house by the
Sun who has rendered the man incapable of proceeding further on his
journey—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 440), which reproduces the
exact words of *Parāśaramādhava*, just quoted.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 152), as laying down that the
guest must he fed.
