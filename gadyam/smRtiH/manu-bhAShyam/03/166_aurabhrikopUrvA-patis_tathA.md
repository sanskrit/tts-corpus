**उरभ्रा** मेषास् तैश् चरति, क्रयविक्रयादिना व्यवहरति, तद्धनप्रधानो वा । एवं **माहिषिकः** । परः पूर्वो यस्याः, तस्याः पतिः भर्ता । या अन्यस्मै दत्ता अन्येन वा ऊढा तां पुनः यः संस्करोति, पुनर् भवति भर्ता पौनर्भवो नरो भर्त्तासाव् इति शास्त्रेण । प्रेतान् यो निर्यापयति वहति । एते **यत्नतो वर्जनीयाः** ॥ ३.१५६ ॥

‘*Urabhra*’ is *sheep*; one who ‘deals’ in these,—*i.e*., carries on the
business of buying and selling them; it may also mean ‘one whose chief
wealth consists in sheep.’

Similarly, the ‘*buffalo-keeper*.’

‘He who has had another man for her former husband;’—the husband of such
a one; *i.e*., one who marries again the woman who has been previously
given to—or married by—another man; he who ‘again’ (*punaḥ*) ‘*becomes*’
(*bhavati*) the husband; such a husband is called ‘*paunarbhava*’ by the
scriptures.

He who carries the dead—*i.e*., carries the dead bodies.

These ‘*should be avoided with care*’— (166).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 688), which (on p.
694) explains ‘*Aurabhrikaḥ*’ as ‘one who keeps sheep as a means of
livelihood’,—and *māhiṣikaḥ*’ as meaning either (a) ‘one who keeps
buffaloes’, or (b) ‘the son of an unchaste woman’,—this latter
explanation being based upon a text quoted from Devala,—‘An unchaste
wife is called *Māhiṣī*; the son born of her is called *Māhiṣikaḥ*,’—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 484);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 40), which
explains ‘*pretaniryātakaḥ*’ as ‘one who carries dead bodies on payment
of wages’.
