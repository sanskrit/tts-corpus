Having placed the balls on the kuśa-grass, he should turn towards the
North, leftwards; since we read in another *Smṛti*—‘turning to the left,
towards the north.’

Seated with his face towards the North, he should sip water. ‘*Having
sipped water*’— he should perform ‘breath-suppression’ three times;
*e.g*., simply supressing the breath three times—only this much;—the
rule relating to the repeating of the *Gāyatrī* verse along with the
‘*Śiras*’ formula (Yājña. *Ācāra* 23) not applying to the present case.

‘*Gently*’—so that there may not he much pain. This is what has been
asserted (elsewhere) in the words—‘having suppressed the breathing as
much as one can.’

Still facing the North, he should salute, &c., &c.—saying, ‘Salutation
to the spring!’ and so forth.

He should also salute the Pitṛs; ‘*with proper formulas* with the
*mantra*, ‘*Na* *mo vaḥ pitaraḥ*, &c., &c.’ This saluting of the Pitṛs
should be done with face turned towards the Balls; for another *Smṛti*
says that this is to be done by ‘turning round.’—(217).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 241), which explains the word
‘*mantravat*’ (the reading adopted by it, along with Medhātithi, in
place of ‘*mantravit*’), as referring to the *Yajurveda-text*—‘*namo vaḥ
pitaro rasāya—namo vaḥ pitaraḥ śoṣāya—namo vaḥ pitaro jīvāya—namo vaḥ
pitaraḥ svadhāyai—namo vaḥ pitaro ghorāya—namo vaḥ pitaro manyave*,’
where, according to Halāyudha, the six
names—‘Rasa—Śoṣa—Jīva—Svadhā—Ghora—and Manyu’—stand respectively for the
six seasons—Spring, Summer, Rains, Autumn, Pre-winter and Mid-winter;
and what is meant is that these should be thought of as ‘Pitṛs’ and then
saluted.—It further adds that as no such ‘salutation to the Seasons’ is
spoken of in Gobhila’s *Gṛhyasūtra*, what Manu says should be taken as
applying to Brāhmaṇas other than those who belong to the Sāmaveda.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 601) also quotes this verse, and adds that the
salutation to the Seasons is to be made with the *mantra*—‘*namo vaḥ
pitaraḥ &c*., *&c*.’

*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 328) quotes this verse, and adds that Medhātithi has
explained the phrase ‘*trirāyamya asūn*’ as ‘*triḥ prāṇāyāmam kṛtvā*.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 507);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1451) to
the effect that the sipping of water should be done after the washing of
the hand;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 193), which adds that the
mantra for bowing to the seasons begins with ‘*vasantāya*’ and that for
saluting the Pitṛs, with ‘*amīmadanta*.’

*Laghu-Āśvalāyana* (13.75).—‘Having taken leave with the mantra, *Atra,
etc*., he shall turn towards the north and restrain his breath.’

217	Having (next) sipped water, turned round (towards the north), and thrice slowly suppressed his breath, (the sacrificer) who knows the sacred texts shall worship (the guardian deities of) the six seasons and the manes.
