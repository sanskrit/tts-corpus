‘Rites performed for the gods’ are not regarded as conferring any
benefit on the gods; such, however, is not the case with this rite which
is named ‘*Pitrya*.’ “What then?” It is ‘*known*,’ among people learned
in the Vedas as ‘*beneficial to the dead*’—as conferring a benefit on
the dead.

‘*On the moonless night*’—on the day on which there is no moon; *i.e*.,
the *amārasyā* day. Another residing is ‘*vidhikṣaye*.’ But the most
faultless reading is ‘*vidhuhṣaye*.’ The meaning of the former would be
that the rile named *Pitryā* is one that has been prescribed as to be
done in the house.

‘*Upon this*’—upon this rite,—‘*he who is intent*’—he who is busy with
its performance. To him there ‘*always accrues*,’ ‘*benefit after
death*;’ *i.e*., for him also benefit after death is conferred by his
sons performing the *śrāddha* and other rites for him.

What this means is that the continuity of the lines of one’s
descendants—sons and grandsons—is the reward of performing *śrāddhas*.
But this reward is not the incentive to its performance; as the rite has
already been described as an obligatory one.

Others, however, have regarded this as indicating another incentive, for
one desiring continuity of his line.

‘*Offered according to human ordinances*’:—*i.e*., this rite is
performed according to rules laid down in the *Smṛtis*.—(127)

‘*Vidhukṣaye*’—‘On the moonless day’.—Govindarāja reads ‘*vidhiḥ
kṣaye*’, which Medhātithi notes with approval, and explains as—the
‘*vidhi*’, *rite*, named—‘*nāma*’—‘*Pitrya*,’ is to be performed *in the
house*, ‘*kṣaye, gṛhe*.’

*Gautama* (15.1).—‘One shall offer Śrāddha to Pitṛs on the moonless
day.’

*Viṣṇu* (76.1-2).—‘The moonless day, the three Aṣṭakās, the three
Anvaṣṭakās, the full-moon days of the month of Māgha, the thirteenth day
of the darker fortnight following after the full-moon day of the month
of Bhādra;—these are the occasions for obligatory Śrāddha, laid down by
Prajāpati; one not offering Śrāddha on these days falls into hell.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.8.1).—‘Offerings to Pitṛs are praiseworthy and conducive
to longevity, heaven and prosperity.’

*Prajāpati-Smṛti* (21).—‘If one performs Śrāddha on the moonless day,
with the help of Brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda, his Pitṛs become
satisfied and reward him with what he desires.’
