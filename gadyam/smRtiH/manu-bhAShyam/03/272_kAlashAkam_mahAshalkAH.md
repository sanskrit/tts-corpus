‘*Kālaśāka*’—is a well-known variety of vegetable; applying to the
darker variety of the ‘*Vāstūka*.’

‘*Mahāśalka*’ stands for the porcupine. Others have explained it as
standing for a special kind of fish.

‘*Khaḍga*’—Rhinoceros.

‘*Loha*’—the black goat, or one whiçh is *red* all over. Says the
*Purāṇa*—‘the red goat, and the black one, serve for endless time.’
Though the term ‘*loha*’ denotes the *colour*, it indirectly indicates
the goat having that colour. The term ‘*loha*’ is used in the sense of
‘black’ as well as ‘red’—being applied to iron, which is black, as also
to *copper* which is red. Though this variety of colour is found in
sheep and other animals also, yet, on the strength of other *Smṛtis*, it
has been explained here as standing for the *goat* only.

Others, however, have explained the term ‘*loha*’ as standing for the
bird, called ‘*lohapṛṣṭha*,’ the Heron; which is mentioned by means of a
part of the name only. Just as Devadatta is often spoken of as simply
‘Datta.’

It is necessary to find the support of usage in the case of both these
explanations.

‘*Honey*’—that collected by bees.

In the case of all the things mentioned in the present contest, all that
is meant is the *great satisfaction* produced by the offerings; and
stress is not meant to be laid upon the exact period of time mentioned
in each case. If this were really meant, then one might be justified in
omitting the performance of *Śrāddhas* for twelve years; and this would
be contrary to what has been declared, to the effect that ‘Rites in
honour of the Pitṛs should be performed till death.’ (Verse 279).—(272)

‘*Kālaśāka*’—Buhler has misread Medhātithi; there is no such expression
in Medhātithi as ‘*Kṛṣṇavāsudeva*’; the word used is *Kṛṣṇe
vāstukabhede*, which means ‘the darker variety of the *vāstuka* herb’.
According to Nandana, it stands for the ‘Black
*neem*’.—*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 706) quoting the verse, explains
it as ‘well known in the northern country’.

‘*Mahāśalka*’—Medhātithi explains this as ‘*śalyakā*’, ‘the porcupine’,
or (according to ‘others’, a *kind of fish*). \[Medhātithi says nothing
as to ‘others’ *reading ‘saśalkhān*’\].—*Parāśaramādhava* explains it as
‘a particular kind of fish’;—‘*loha*’ as ‘the red-coloured goat’—and
‘*munyanna*’ as ‘*Nīvāra* and the like’.

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 541 and 586);—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 14), which says that according to the
‘ancients’, ‘*mahāśalka*’ stands for the *Rohita* fish;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 536).

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.17.1-3).—‘For endless time, with the meat of
the rhinoceros; so also with the meat of the Śātabali fish, and that of
the old goat.’

*Viṣṇu* (80.23-24).—‘Here is the song sung by the Pitṛs—Kālaśāka,
porcupine, the meat of the old goat, and the rhinoceros without
horns,—these we eat constantly.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.260).—‘The meat of the rhinoceros, the porcupine,
honey, hermit’s food, meat of the red goat, Mahāśāka, and the meat of
the old goat.’
