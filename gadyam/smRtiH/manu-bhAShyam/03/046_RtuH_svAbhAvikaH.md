<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The verse is meant to provide a definition of ‘season;’ and what is
stated here is based upon medical science, not upon any scriptural
injunctions. Similarly, the two verses beginning with the
*forty-eighth*.

‘*Sixteen days*,’ in every month, constitute the ‘natural season’ for
women. That ‘every month’ is meant, we gather from other sources, though
it is not mentioned in this verse.

‘*Normal*’—what comes by nature; *i.e*., what happens in the case of
women in normal health; in cases of disease and such other causes, the
flow is absent even when the time has arrived; and by means of such
medicines as butter and sesamum, and so forth, or by excessive sexual
intercourse, the flow is brought on even before time. Hence the sixteen
days are called the ‘normal season.’

‘*Including the four days*’—the four days that are censured by all good
men, during which the touching of, and conversing with, the woman has
been prohibited; these are the four days beginning with the first day on
which the flow of blood becomes visible. ‘*Day*’ stands for ‘day and
night.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 437) in support of
the view that counting from the first day of the menses, sixteen days
constitute the ‘season’, of which the first four days are condemned by
good men.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 539) quotes this verse, and adds that the
addition of the term ‘*svābhāvikaḥ*’, ‘normal,’ indicates that the
period may vary, on account of the presence of certain diseases and
other causes.

This verse is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 166);—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 680), which adds that the specification of
‘night’ implies the prohibition of intercourse during the day;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 38).
