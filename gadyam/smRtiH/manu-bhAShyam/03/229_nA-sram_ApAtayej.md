Never should he shed tears; nor should he become angry; nor tell a lie. He should not touch the food with his foot, nob shake it.—(229)

‘*Asra*’ is tear; this he should not ‘*shed*’—drop. As a rule, during
the performance of *Śrāddha* in honour of the dead, one is apt to recall
the grief caused by the loss of the loved person, which leads to the
shedding of tears; and this is what is prohibited here; there is no harm
in the sudden dropping of the tears of joy.

‘*Never*’—on no account—shall he shed tears.

‘*He should not become angry*,’—should not take up an angry attitude.

The telling of a lie having been already prohibited with a view to the
fulfilment of man’s purpose in general, it is again prohibited here,
with a view to the due fulfilment of the act of *śrāddha*.

‘*He should not touch the food with his foot*’—any food, either in the
form of leavings or otherwise.

‘*He should not shake* *it*’—*i.e*., he shall not throw it by hand and
then again take it in.

Others have explained this verse to mean that he shall not shake a piece
of cloth over the food, as is often done for the removing of dust, etc.,
from it.—(229)

‘*Avadhūnayet*’—‘Shake; *i.e*., throw it by the hand and then take it
in’ (Medhātithi);—‘Shake a piece of cloth over the food, as is often
done for the removing of dust etc.’ (‘Others’ mentioned in Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1029), which explains the
meaning to be that ‘there should be no weeping’, and goes on to add—what
is forbidden is not the tear of joy (at the offering), but the tears
that may come to the eyes by reason of the death of the beloved
relative,—the telling of lies which has already been prohibited
elsewhere from moral considerations, is here forbidden as affecting the
performance of the offering;—one should not touch with his feet any kind
of food, whether, clean or unclean,—nor should cloth be shaken over the
food;—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 161), which explains ‘*asram*’ as
tears of grief, and in regard to the ‘shaking of cloth’, it says that
some people explain it as *dusting the doth over the food*, while
according to others, what is forbidden is the fanning of the food with a
piece of cloth;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 549).

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.17, 3).—‘\[He shall avoid\] *non-haviṣya*
food, untruth, anger and also that which would make others angry.’

*Viṣṇu* (79.19-20).—‘He shall avoid anger;—he shall not shed tears.’

*Viṣṇu* (81.1).—‘He shall not place the food on the seat; nor shall he
touch it with the foot.’

*Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa* (Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 1029).—‘He shall not
shed tears at the Śrāddha; nor shall he utter words of grief; he shall
not hear ill-will towards those eating nor be jealous of them.’

*Devala* (Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 1029).—‘At the Śrāddha,
people should not shed tears, nor converse, nor laugh among themselves,
nor wander about, nor be angry, nor be worried; even though there be
sufficient cause, one shall not utter words of anger; near the Pitṛs one
shall not sit either supported or perspiring.’
