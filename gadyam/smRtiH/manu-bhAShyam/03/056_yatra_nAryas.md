<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*The gods rejoice*’—are satisfied, pleased; and being pleased, they
bestow upon the master of the house desirable rewards.

‘*Where they are not honoured*, *all rites are fruitless*’—; sacrifices,
libations and charities,—gifts made with the motive of pleasing the
gods,—all such acts, though done, become fruitless.

This is a commendatory exaggeration.—(56)
