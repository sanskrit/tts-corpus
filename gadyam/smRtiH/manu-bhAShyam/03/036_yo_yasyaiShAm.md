यद् उक्तम् "गुणदोषौ च यस्य यौ" (म्ध् ३.२२) इति तत् स्मारयति । बहवो वक्तव्यतया प्रतिज्ञातास् तत्र वक्ष्यमाणैः श्लोकैर् अयम् अर्थ उच्यत इति विशेषज्ञानार्थं युक्तः पुनर् उपन्यासः । 

- **एषाम् विवाहानाम्** इति निर्धारणे षष्ठी । एवं विवाहानां यस्य विवाहस्य **यो गुणः कीर्तित** आचार्येण मनुना **सर्वं शृणुत तं** गुणं **विप्राः** । भृगुर् महर्षीन् आमन्त्रयते । **सम्यग्** अवैपरीत्येनानाकुलं **कीर्तयतः** कथयतः ॥ ३.३६ ॥

The author is reminding his audience of what he had said before (Verse
22) regarding the ‘good and bad points of each form of marriage.’ Many
things have been promised as to be described; and what he means to do by
this verse is to point out that by means of the forthcoming verses he is
going to explain such and such a subject. The reiteration contained iu
this verse therefore is quite proper.

‘*Of these forms of marriage*’.— The genitive has- the sense of
*selection*. The meaning being that from among these marriage-forms, to
each has been ascribed a quality by the teacher, Munu;—‘*To all this
listen, O Brāhmaṇas*.’ This is addressed by Bhṛgu to the great sages.

‘*Correctly*’’—without altering anything.

‘*proceed to describe*’—expound.—(36)
