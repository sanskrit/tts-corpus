He at whose Śrāddhas and sacrifices, the friend forms the principal factor,—for him, after death, there is no reward, either for Śrāddhas or for sacrifices.—(139)

This verse supplies the commendatory supplement to the foregoing
prohibition.

The term ‘*friend*’ is used here in the abstract sense; hence the
meaning is ‘in which friendship enters as the prime consideration.’ And
this includes both friend and foe.

The term ‘*sacrifice’ stands* for (1) gifts given with reference to gods
and (2) the feeding of Brāhmaṇas with a view to some transcendental
result.

‘*Pretya phalam nāsti*’ (‘after death there is no reward’)—

“No construction is possible of this clause; since the nominative of the
root ‘*pra + iṇ*’ (of the act of *dying* denoted by the word ‘*pretya*’)
is the person performing the *śrāddha*, whereas of the verb ‘*na* +
*asti*’ (‘is not’) the nominative is ‘*phala*,’ ‘reward’ \[and as a
rule, the nominative of the participle ‘*pretya*’ and the finite verb
‘*nāsti*’ should be one and the same\].”

In answer to this, some people explain that the term ‘*pretya*’ is an
independent word, an indeclinable noun, denoting *the other world* \[and
is not a participle at all\]. Another explanation is that of the root
*pra* + *in* also ‘reward’ is the nominative; the meaning of the
participle in this case being ‘*even though arriving near*,’ ‘it does
not come about,’—*i.e*., it fails to be enjoyed.—(139)

**(verses 3.139-140)  
**

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.8).—‘Offerings given to friends and relations
reach neither the gods nor the Pitṛs.’ *Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana,
90.42-43).—‘If at one’s offerings to gods and Pitṛs, his friends happen
to form the predominant factor, then neither the gods nor the Pitṛs are
satisfied; and he goes not to heaven. If one makes friends at the
Śrāddha, he goes not by the path of the gods; collecting his friends at
Śrāddha, ho falls off from heaven.’

139	He who performs funeral sacrifices and offerings to the gods chiefly for the sake of (gaining) friends, reaps after death no reward for Sraddhas and sacrifices.
