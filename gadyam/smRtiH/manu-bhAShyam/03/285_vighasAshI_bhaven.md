One should daily live upon “vighasa,” and daily he should eat “amṛta.” “Vighasa” is that which is left by those who must be fed; and “amṛta” is the remnant of sacrific es.—(285)

The first quarter of the verse reiterates the ‘eating,’ that has been
laid down before, of the food left after the guests and other persons
have eaten.

All scriptures being meant to be conducive to welfare, scriptural
treatises always conclude with auspicious declarations; and Rites in
honour of the gods are more auspicious than those in honour of the
Pitṛs.

‘*Remnant of sacrifices*.’— This shows that the eating of the remnants
of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other sacrifices stands on the same footing a
the ‘eating of Vighasa.’

The second half of the verse contains the explanation of the Vedic
declaration, offered by the author, through kindness. He seeks to remove
any misconception that people might have regarding the two terms in
question, which are what have been used in some Vedic rescensional
texts.

He who eats *Vighasa* is said to ‘live upon Vighasa;’ and he who eats
*Amṛta* is said to ‘eat *Amṛta*.’

‘*What is left by those who must be fed*’—*i.e*., what is left after
persons, who must be fed, have been fed.

Others have explained that what is meant is ‘what has been left after
people have been fed at *Śrāddha*,’—on the ground that it is *Śrāddha*
that forms the subject-matter of the context. To the same end there is
another *Smṛti-text*—‘One should eat after having served the Pitṛs.’

Some people say that the ‘eating’ here mentioned forms part of the
*Śrāddha-* rite. While others have said that this restriction regarding
food is meant to serve a special purpose for man; the treatment of
*Śrāddhas* having ended with verse 284.

‘*Remnant of sacrifices*’ should be understood to mean what is left of
the materials used at sacrifices.—(285)

*Mahābhārata* (12.249.12-13) \[reproducing the first line of
Manu\].—‘The remnant of sacrifices is *amṛta*; and the eating of this is
equal to the eating of sacrificial food. He who eats the food left over
after the servants have eaten, is called the *vighasāśī*; *vighasa*
being the food left by servants, and *amṛta*, the remnant of
sacrifices.’ *Mahābhārata* (3.2.60).—\[Reproduces Manu\].

285	Let him daily partake of the vighasa and daily eat amrita (ambrosia); but vighasa is what remains from the meal (of Brahmana guests) and the remainder of a sacrifice (is called) amrita.
