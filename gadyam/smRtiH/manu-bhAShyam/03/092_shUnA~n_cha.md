Having taken up some food in a vessel, he should place food on the
ground, with a view to benefit the dogs and the rest.

‘*Persons afflicted with filthy diseases*’—Lepers, consumptives, and so
forth.

‘*Vayāṃsi*’—birds.

‘*Gently*’—*i.e*., in such, a way that the food does not become mixed
with the dust raised from the ground.

The ‘*ground*’ has been mentioned, not with a view to preclude the use
of a vessel, but simply to indicate that food for the Cāṇḍāla, the
outcast and the leper should not be given in their hands.

What the present verse prescribes is the *according of help*; that is
why the verse contains the Genitive, not the Dative, ending.

For the birds, food should be placed on a spot where they can eat it
without being scared away by dogs, &ç.

For *insects*, the food should be placed on a spot where they are likely
to be present.—(92)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 342), which adds
that the object of the verb is ‘*annāni*’ understood;—in *Smṛtitattva*
(p. 424) in support of the view that (a) wherever such offering is laid
down as to be given to ‘*birds*’, it is the *crow* that is meant
(evidently the author adopts the reading *Vāyasānām* for *Vayasām*), and
that (b) in texts laying down such offerings to the ‘unfit’, it is
persons afflicted with ‘filthy diseases’ that are meant;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 316) as laying down the offering of food outside
the house;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 403), where ‘*Śanakaiḥ*’ is
explained as ‘in such a manner as no food may be wasted,’ which adds
that the offering made for the benefit of ‘crows’ and others should be
put in places where they may be of the greatest use to them;—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 1.103, p. 75);—in *Aparārka*, which adds that the
‘*patita*’ here is meant to include such sects of mendicants as go about
with human skulls in their hands;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 286) as
laying down the ‘offering to Bhūtas, living creatures’.
