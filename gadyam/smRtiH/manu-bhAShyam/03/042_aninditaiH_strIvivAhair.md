This verse sums up the results of marriages briefly. Those marriages are
called ‘unblamable’ which have been sanctioned by the scriptures: and
the offspring—in the shape of son, etc.—born from wives wedded by those
forms of marriage is ‘*unblamable*,’—*i.e*., praiseworthy.

‘*From blameworthy*’—*i.e*., prohibited—‘*marriages*’ is born
‘*blameworthy*,’ defective, child.

‘*Therefore*’—with the view that such children may not be born as become
a source of pain, ‘*one should avoid the blamable marriages*’—(42)
