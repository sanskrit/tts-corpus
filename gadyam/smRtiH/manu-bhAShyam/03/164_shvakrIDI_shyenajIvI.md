‘*He who sports with dogs*’—*i.e*., keeps dogs for sporting purposes.

‘*Falconer*’—he who lives on falcons,—*i.e*, by baying and selling them.
The ‘*bird-keeper*’ mentioned before (162) is one who keeps them in
cages.

He who makes a virgin cease to be a virgin is called ‘the defiler of
virgins.’

The ‘*cruel man*’ is one who takes delight in killing animals.

He who derives subsistence from serving the Śūdras.

‘*Vṛṣalaputraḥ*’ is another reading (for ‘*vṛṣalavṛttiḥ*’), which means
‘he who has only *Śūdra* children;’ ‘having only Śūdra children’ being a
‘reprehensible act.’

He who sacrifices to the deities called ‘*gaṇas*.’ ‘*Gaṇayāgas*’ are
well known.—(164)
