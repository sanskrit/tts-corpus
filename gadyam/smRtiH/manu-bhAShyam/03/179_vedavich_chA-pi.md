If a Brāhmaṇa, though learned in the Veda, should, through covetousness, accept a gift from him,—he quickly perishes; just like the unbaked vessel in water.—(170)

प्रसङ्गाच् छूद्रयाजकस्याप्रतिग्राह्यतानेन कथ्यते । **वेदविद् अपि** यदि तस्य शूद्रयाजकस्य संबन्धिनो द्रव्यस्य प्रतिग्रहं करोति, **लोभाद्** इत्य् अनुवादः, सो ऽपि **विनाशं व्रजति**, अभिलषितेनार्थेन वियुज्यते धनपुत्रपशुशरीरादिना । किं पुनर् अवेदवित् । वेदविदः किल प्रतिग्रहे नातीव दोष इति वक्ष्यति । **आमपात्रम्** अपक्वं शरावादिभाजनम् । **अम्भसि** जले क्षिप्तम् ॥ ३.१६९ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In connection with the present subject, the author points out the
impropriety of receiving gifts from one who officiates at sacrifices
performed by *Śūdras*.

‘*Though learned in the Veda*;’—if he accepts the gift of something
belonging to one who officiates at sacrifices performed by *Śūdras*,

‘*Through covetousness*’—is a mere reiterative reference.

He also *perishes quickly*—*i.e*., he is deprived of what he desires,—in
the shape of wealth, children, cattle, body, and the like.

When such is the fate of one learned in the Veda—what is to be said of
one who is ignorant of the Veda?

The author will point out later on that there is not much harm in the
learned man’s receiving gifts.

‘*Āma*’—unbaked—‘*pātra*’—vessels, such as saucer, and the like.

‘*In water*’—*i.e*., when thrown into water.—(179)

*Atri-Smṛti* (2, 5).—‘One shall not be addicted to sinful acts, on the
strength of the Veda; for an intentional sin is not destroyed by the
Veda.’

*Atri-Saṃhitā* (145).—‘By accepting gifts they perish, as fire perishes
by water.’

179	And if a Brahmana, though learned in the Veda, accepts through covetousness a gift from such (a man), he will quickly perish, like a vessel of unburnt clay in water.
