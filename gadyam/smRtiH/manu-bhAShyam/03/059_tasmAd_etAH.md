Hence men who seek (their own) welfare, should always honour women on holidays and festivals with (gifts of) ornaments, clothes, and (dainty) food.—(59)


(Note: the above is an alternate translation by George Bühler)


Verses 57—66 are omitted by Medhātithi. [Query—are they interpolations?] “These are very probably a later addition. The corresponding section in the Mahābhārata, 13.46 stops right here also.”—Hopkins. They are all quoted in Vivādaratnākara and in Parāśaramādhava.

‘*Satkāreṣu*’—‘On holidays’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka, and
Rāghavānanda);—Reading ‘*Satkāreṇa*’, Nārāyaṇa explains it as ‘by kind
speech’.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 418);—and in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 506).

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśā. 46.15).—‘The women are like the Goddess of Wealth:
