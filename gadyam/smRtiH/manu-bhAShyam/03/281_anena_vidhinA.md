<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In accordance with the rules laid down here—*i.e*., following the
procedure, beginning with inviting the Brāhmaṇas on the previous day,
and ending with performing the *Śrāddha* thrice in the year—one should
offer the *Śrāddha*—in what months *?*—‘*during winter, summer and the
rains*.’

What is said here regarding the *Śrāddha* to be offered ‘thrice in the
year’ is to be regarded as optional with what has been said above (122)
regarding its being offered ‘month after month.’

‘*That which forms part of the Five Sacrifices*’—that which has been
prescribed among the ‘Five Sacrifices’—should be performed every day.

In connection with this last, the only procedure to be adopted consists
in—(*a*) wearing the sacred thread over the right shoulder, (*b*) making
offerings from left to right, and (*c*) feeding the Brāhmaṇas with face
towards the north. That is why it has been re-mentioned here.

It is in view of this text that older people have explained that the
rule regarding the offering of *Śrāddha* thrice in the year is meant for
one who has not set up the fire. But what authority they have for this,
they alone know.—(281)
