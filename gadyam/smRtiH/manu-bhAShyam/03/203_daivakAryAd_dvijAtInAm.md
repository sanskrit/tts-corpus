For twice-born men, the rite in honour of the Pitṛs excels that in honour of the gods; the rite in honour of the gods has been declared to be the previous sustainer of the rite in honour of the Pitṛs.—(203)

देवान् उद्दिश्य यत् क्रियते तद् **दैवं कार्यम्** । ततः **पितृकार्यं विशिष्यते**, विशेषेण कर्तव्यम् उद्दिश्यते । अनेन पित्र्यस्य प्राधान्यम् आह । दैवं तत्राङ्गं कर्मेत्य् उक्तं भवति । अङ्गकर्मताम् एव स्पष्टयति । दैवं हि यद् ब्राह्मणभोजनं **तत् पितृकार्यस्याप्यायनं** वृद्धिकरम् । न स्वतःप्रधानं पित्र्यस्यैव पोषकम् ॥ ३.१९३ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The rite done in honour of the gods is excelled by that done in honour
of the Pitṛs; *i.e*., the latter has been more emphatically enjoined.

This only indicates the predominance of the rite in honour of the Pitṛs;
the meaning being that the rite in honour of the gods is subsidiary to
that in honour of the Pitṛs.

This same subsidiary character is more clearly stated,—‘*The
rite*’—*i.e*., the feeding of Brāhmaṇas—‘*that is done in honour of the
gods*’ is the, ‘*sustainer*’—helper—‘*of the rite done in honour of the
Pitṛs*;’ so that it is not by itself an important act, being only an aid
of that in honour of the Pitṛs.—(203)

This verse is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 526), which
explains ‘*āpyāyanam*’ as ‘helping’, ‘subsidiary’.

*Āśvalāyana* (24.1).—‘Without offering the sacrifice to the Pitṛs, or
the annual Śrāddha to individual ancestors,—if one performs other five
sacrifices, he surely goes to hell.’

203	For twice-born men the rite in honour of the manes is more important than the rite in honour of the gods; for the offering to the gods which precedes (the Sraddhas), has been declared to be a means of fortifying (the latter).
