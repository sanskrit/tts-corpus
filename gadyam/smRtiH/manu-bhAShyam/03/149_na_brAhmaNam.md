<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse is not meant to be prohibitive o? the examination of
Brāhmaṇas (to be invited) at the rite performed in honour of the gods;
what is meant by it is the permitting, at certain times, of the feeding,
at rites in honour of gods, of such persons as are one-eyed, suffering
from elephantiasis, and so forth.

‘*At the rite in honour of the Pitṛs*’—*i,e*., when the time for
*Śrāddha* has arrived, one should do the examination with great care;
not so at the rite performed in honour of the gods. At the latter, one
may sometimes even feed those going to be mentioned. Who are those that
are permitted to be fed, we shall show later on.

According to others, however, this verse has been introduced for the
purpose of enjoining the strict exclusion of those going to be
mentioned; and not for that of permitting the feeding of those at the
rites in honour of gods.—(149)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 556), which explains
‘*parīkṣeta*’ as ‘make an investigation regarding their learning and
conduct’;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 287);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p.
6b);—in *Hemādri*, (Śrāddha, p. 510);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.
34) as meaning that the testing in the case of *Pitṛkṛtya* is to be more
thorough than in that of *Devakṛtya*.

*Viṣṇu* (82-1, 2).—‘At the rite in honour of the gods, one shall not
examine the Brāhmaṇa; at that in honour of Pitṛs he shall examine him
with care.’

149	For a rite sacred to the gods, he who knows the law will not make (too close) inquiries regarding an (invited) Brahmana; but when one performs a ceremony in honour of the manes, one must carefully examine (the qualities and parentage of the guest).
