One should first engage the Brāhmaṇa in honour of the gods, as a protection to these (offerings to) Pitṛs; for the Rākṣasas take away the śrāddha that is devoid of protection.—(204)

‘*Ārakṣa*’ is the same as ‘*rakṣā*;’ and that which has reached that is
called ‘*ārakṣabhūtam*;’ *i.e*., that which serves the purpose of
protecting.

Or, the term ‘*bhūtam*’ may be taken as connoting *similitude*; in which
case, the meaning is—‘which is, as it were, a protection.’

Because it is so, therefore ‘*one should first engage*’—invite—‘*the
Brāhmaṇa in honour of the gods*’— and make him sit upon a proper seat.

The rest of the verse is a purely laudatory description.

‘*Rākṣasas*;’—certain invisible beings, described in *Itihāsas*—‘*take
away*’—the Śrāddha—from the Pitṛs.

“Who are the gods, in honour of whom the Brāhmaṇa is to be invited?”

In the *Gṛhyasūtra*, we find the *mantra*—‘We invite the Viśvedevas,
&c.’—as the one to be used; from which it follows that the *Viśvedevas*
are the gods. In the *Purāṇas* also it is said—‘The *Śruti* says that it
is *Viśvedevas*.’—(204)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 476), which explains ‘*ārakṣa*’
as equivalent to ‘*rakṣaṇa*’;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 426),
which explains ‘*ārakṣabhūtam*,’ as some little (not complete)
safeguard;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 54) as indicating the
importance of Daiva Śrāddha.

*Laghu-Āśvalāyana* (23.27).—‘Having, in the prescribed manner,
worshipped the gods, he shall, with their permission, perform the
worship of the Pitṛs, in the *Apasavya* form.’

*Dharma* (Aparārka, p. 476).—‘Having seated the Gods, and then the
Pitṛs.’

204	Let him first invite a (Brahmana) in honour of the gods as a protection for the (offering to the manes); for the Rakshasas destroy a funeral sacrifice which is left without such a protection.
