That which is given to the trader is neither here nor there. Similarly, what is given to the Brāhmaṇa born of a remarried woman is like a libation poured on ashes.—(181)

अयम् अपि पूर्ववद् व्याख्येयः । वाणिजकस्य भोजनं निषिद्धम् । न तद्देशसंनिधिः । न हि यथा पूर्वत्र वीक्ष्येति दृष्टिगोचरे देशे लक्षणया संनिधिस् तद्वद् इह तादृशं किंचिन् निबन्धनम् अस्ति । **पौनर्भवो** नवमे वक्ष्यते (म्ध् ९.१७५) ॥ ३.१७१ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This also is to be explained as the preceding verse.

It is the *feeding* of the Trader that is prohibited, not his proximity
to the place; because there is no ground for taking the words of the
present verse as conveying this latter sense, as there was in the case
of a previous verse (177), where the term, ‘by looking,’ was taken as
indirectly indicating ‘visible place,’ and hence prohibiting the man’s
proximity to the place.

The man ‘*born of the a remarried woman*’ shall be described later on,
under discourse 9 (verse 175)—(181)

181	What has been given to a Brahmana who lives by trade that is not (useful) in this world and the next, and (a present) to a Brahmana born of a remarried woman (resembles) an oblation thrown into ashes.
