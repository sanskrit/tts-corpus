‘*Water-courses*’—the sources of water;—‘*he who diverts*’ these;
*i.e*., having cut the embankments, takes the water to irrigate his
field, &c.

‘He who is addicted to obstructing them’—*i.e*, the water-courses.

‘*Obstructing*’ means *covering up*; hence the meaning is that^(‘)he who
closes the source from which the water flows.’

The person who advises regarding the position of houses;—one who lives
by the science of architecture; *i.e*., the architect, the mason, and so
forth. One who plans his own houses is not meant here.

‘*Messenger*,’—the king’s servant; who is employed by him as a slave. He
is one who is employed in business relating to peace and war.

He who plants trees for payment. Planting them as a righteous act is not
reprehensible; because such an act would not be ‘reprehensible
practice;’ in fact, the planting of trees has been actually enjoined, as
we learn from such assertions as^(‘)he who has planted ten mango-trees
goes not to hell.’—(163)
