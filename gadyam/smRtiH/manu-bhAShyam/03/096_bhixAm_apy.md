It has been said above that the alms is to be given ‘in the proper
form;’ and this form is now described.

The mention of the ‘water-pot,’ which has not been referred to in this
context before, is meant to indicate that in all cases one need not
always give *alms* only.

‘*Having honoured*,’—after having worshipped.

‘*Vidhipūrvakam*,’—‘*in accordance with scriptural injun*
*ctions*’—means ‘that which has scriptural injunctions for its
precedent;’ the term ‘precedent’ meaning *reason*; the compound
therefore means that what is here stated is on the basis of scriptural
injunctions.

Or, the term ‘*vidhi*’ may stand for *method*; the sense being that the
right, method should be adopted first; the method being that ‘he should
be honoured,’ as already mentioned.

‘*The true meaning of the Veda*’—the real, the undoubted, sense of the
Veda; he who knows this meaning—to such a Brāhmaṇa one should ‘make
over’ the things.

The term ‘*to the Brāhmaṇa*’ restricts the gift to the particular caste;
and the term ‘*knowing*, &c.’ restricts it to persons possessing a
certain qualification.

Hence, in connection with the act of giving, three things are enjoined
here—

1.  ‘whatever is to be given should be given to the Brāhmaṇa,’
2.  ‘to a Brāhmaṇa who knows the meaning of the Veda,’
3.  and ‘only after having honoured him,’

And this multiplicity of injunctions (in a single verse) (though
inadmissible in a Vedic text) may be admissible in the work of a human
author.

The next, verse proceeds to point out the danger in connection with the
act of ‘giving’ enjoined above.—(96).

‘*Satkṛtya*’—‘Having honoured’ (the Brāhmaṇa) (Medhātithi and
Govindarāja);—‘having garnished’ (the food) (Kullūka and Rāghávānanda).

This is quoted, without comment, in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 434).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.12).—‘It is Vaiśvānara that enters the household as a
Brāhmaṇa-guest; hence they offer him water and food; thereby attaining
calm and peace extending over one year.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.108).—‘Food should be given, with due honour, to the
Recluse who is strict in his vows.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.9.8.).—‘All gifts are preceded by water.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 434).—‘By the offer of welcome to
the guest, Agni is pleased; by the offer of food, Indra; by washing his
feet, the Pitṛs; and by feeding him, Prajāpati.’

*Śātātapa* (Do., p. 435).—‘The alms offered should be either *Bhikṣā*
(*i.e*., enough for one meal), or *Puṣkala* (enough for four meals); or
*Hantakāra* (enough for sixteen meals); if none of these is possible
then only a pot of water.’

*Gautama* (5.19).—‘If food is offered after having made the guest
pronounce the syllable *svasti*,—it is excellent.’

096	Let him give, in accordance with the rule, to a Brahmana who knows the true meaning of the Veda, even (a small portion of food as) alms, or a pot full of water, having garnished (the food with seasoning, or the pot with flowers and fruit).
