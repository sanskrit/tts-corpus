‘*Placed*’—*i.e*., prepared and duly arranged.

‘*Separately*’—with proper partition. He shall not provide for all a
single seat, in the form of a long piece of cloth or wooden plank. They
shall be seated in such a manner that they should not touch one another.
It is in this sense that ‘*separately*’ has been added.

‘*With kuśa grass*’— with bundles of Kuśa spread over them.

‘*Who have performed their ablutions*’—*i.e*., who have bathed and
rinsed their mouth in the prescribed manner.

‘*The said*’—those previously invited—‘*he should seat*.’—(208)

*Viṣṇu* (73.2).—‘On the second day, in the forenoon during the brighter
fortnight,—and in the afternoon during the darker fortnight,—he shall
seat on seats covered with kuśa-grass, the Brāhmaṇas who have bathed and
rinsed their mouths, in the order of their learning.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.226).—‘During the afternoon, having respectfully
welcomed the Brāhmaṇas that have come and have rinsed their mouth, he,
with clean hands, shall seat them on seats.’

*Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (4.7.2).—‘The Brāhmaṇas equipped with learning,
character, and excellent conduct, who may have arrived at the same time
and have washed their feet and rinsed their mouths,—these he shall seat,
as if they were his forefathers, with faces turned towards the north.’
