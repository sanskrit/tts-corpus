This is the first course to be adopted in the presenting of the offerings made to Gods and Pitṛs. This (following) is to be regarded as the secondary course always adopted by the good.’—(147)

Beginning with verse 122, twenty-five verses have gone before; and the
upshot of them all is as follows: (*a*) Śrāddhas should be performed on
the moon-less day;—(*b*) the person fed should be learned in the Veda,
highly educated, of right behaviour, belonging to a known family, the
sou of a person learned in the Veda and not bearing any relationship to
the person offering the *Śrāddha*. The rest of it all is only
commendatory.

‘*This*’—what has been just described,—is ‘*the the first*’— the
primary—‘*course*’—procedure at *Śrāddhas*; *viz*., that, the food shall
be presented to one who is not related to the performer.

‘*This*’—what is going to be described—‘should be regarded as ‘*the
secondary course*’—which is to be adopted only in the event of the
primary course being not possible This course is called ‘*anukalpa*,’
‘secondary course,’ by the ‘law of substitutes’ (propounded in
*Mīmāṃsā-sūtra* 3.6.37 *et. seq*.).

‘*Always adopted*’— this is purely commendatory.—(147)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.220, p. 146) in support of the
view that the *sister’s son* and other similar relatives (mentioned in
the next verse, and in Yājñavalkya, 1.220) are to be fed at the
*Śrāddha* only if the above described ‘Brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda’ is
not available;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 558), along with the next
verse;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha; p. 447);—in *Godādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p.
514), which remarks that this secondary method is put forward in view of
the fact that very few Brāhmaṇas are really fit for being fed at
Śrāddha;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 991).

*Medhātithi* (P. 250, l. 15)—‘*Pratinidhinyāyenā*.’—See *Mīmāṃsā sūtra*
3.6.37. The *Yava* having been laid down as a substitute at sacrifices
for the *Vrīhi*, the question is raised as to the necessity or otherwise
of performing all those acts in connection with the substitute which
have been laid down in connection with the original; and the conclusion
is that the substitute has to be treated exactly in the same manner as
the original.
