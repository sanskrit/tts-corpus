<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Some people might argue as follows:—“It has been asserted that ‘at the
rite performed in honour of ancestors one should feed three Brāhmaṇas;’
and in the preceding verse the learners of several recensional texts
have been mentioned; so that there is no possibility of one’s own
companions in study being fed.”

And it is with a view to set aside this notion that the author puts
forward the present verse.

Of these three—the adherents of the three Vedas—anyone may be fed.

That is to say, one may feed either persons professing the same
recensional text as oneself or those professing other several texts.

‘*Duly honoured*’—worshipped, approached, with offerings of water, etc.

‘*Satisfaction to the seventh degree*’—*i.e*., the satisfaction
continues till the seventh degree of descendants. The prolonging of both
vowels in the term ‘*sāptapauruṣī*’ is in accordance with Pāṇini 7.3.20.
This epithet has been added for the purpose of indicating great length
of time; the meaning being that ‘the satisfaction of the ancestors lasts
for a long time.’ The meaning is that ‘by the feeding of the said
Brāhmaṇa, the satisfaction secured to the ancestors is such as lasts
till such time as his sons and grandsons to the seventh degree are
born.’

‘*Everlasting*,’—*i.e*., it does not cease, and then appears again; it
remains there always.—(146)

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 284);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 882);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 8a).

*Bṛhaspati* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 337).—‘If one feeds a single Sāmavedin
at the Śrāddha, all the three Vedas, Ṛk, Sāman and Yajuṣ, are present in
him. If, for the sake of his fathers, one secures one who has pondered
over the texts of the Sāman, then he secures the entire earth along with
hills and forests. The Ṛk satisfies the father, the Yajuṣ, the
grandfather, and the Sāman, the great-grandfather;—and the Chandoga is
superior even to that.’

*Śātātapa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 337).—‘If one feeds an Atharvavedin at
the offerings to Gods and Pitṛs, he attains endless and imperishable
results;—says the Śruti.’

146	If one of these three dines, duly honoured, at a funeral sacrifice, the ancestors of him (who gives the feast), as far as the seventh person, will be satisfied for a very long time.
