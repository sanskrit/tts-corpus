<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is an exaggerated exhortation.

‘*Vṛṣalīphena*’ is the moisture of her mouth; he by whom this has been
drunk is ‘*vṛṣalīphenapīta*;’—the past participial adjective ‘*pīta*’
being put last by the analogy of such compounds as ‘*palāṇḍubhakṣita*,’
and so forth.

If we adopt the other reading ‘*vṛṣalīpītaphenasya*,’ then the compound
‘*pītaphenaḥ*’ is to be expounded as ‘*pītaḥ pheno yasya*;’ and this,
with the term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ taken as an Instrumental *Tatpuruṣa*,—according
to Pāṇini 2. 1. 30. (the sense being ‘the moisture of whose mouth has
been drunk by a *Śūdra* woman’). Or, ‘*pītaphena*,’ expounded as above,
might be taken as forming a *Genetive Tatpuruṣa* with ‘*vṛṣalī*.’

The meaning is the same in all cases. When the husband and wife lie
together, the touching of their lips, etc., are inevitable. Hence, what
the word of the text indicates is *sexual intercourse*, by mentioning
something that is concomitant with it.

From the context it is clear that this verse is supplementary to the
foregoing prohibition, and it is not an independent assertion. If it
were an independent assertion, we should have the prohibition of
*kissing* only, and the other forms of intercourse would become
sanctioned; so that, by having intercourse with a *Śūdra* woman, only if
one avoids *kissing*, he would not be transgressing any scriptural
injunction.

‘*Who has begotten children on her*’—*i.e*., who has had intercourse
with her during her ‘courses.’

‘*Expiation*’—purification there is none. This indicates a high degree
of deprecation.—(19).

wine from the mouth.’
