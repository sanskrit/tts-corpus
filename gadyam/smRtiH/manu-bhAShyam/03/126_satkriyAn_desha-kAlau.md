Respectful treatment, place and time, purity and the qualities of Brāhmaṇas,—a large company hampers these five; therefore one shall not seek a large company.—(126)

**एतान्** दोषान् आपादयति । **विस्तरो** ऽतो नेष्यते । यदि तु शक्यन्ते **सत्क्रिया**दय उपपादयितुं तदा यथोत्साहम् । **सत्क्रिया** अन्नसंस्कारविशेषः । **देशो** दक्षिणप्रवणादिः "अवकाशेषु चोक्षेषु" (म्ध् ३.१९७) इति वक्ष्यमाणः । **कालः** अपराह्णः "मध्याह्नाच् चलिते सूर्ये" इति । **शौचम्** आत्मब्राह्मणप्रेष्यगतम् । **ब्राह्मणानां संपत्** गुणवद्ब्राह्मणलाभः । एते गुणा अवश्यं संपाद्याः । ते च विस्तरेण नश्यन्ति । **विस्तारो** वैगुण्यम् । ब्राह्मणबहुत्वे चासौ प्रसज्जति । **तस्मान् नेहेत** न कुर्यात् ॥ ३.११६ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Since ‘large company’ entails all these defects, therefore ‘large
company’ is not considered desirable. When, however, respectful
treatment and the rest are found feasible, then one might net according
to one’s enthusiasm.

‘*Respectful treatment*’—careful preparation of the food.

‘*Place*’—ground sloping to the south, and so forth (which has been
recommended for *Śrāddhas*), as one going to be described below (in
207).

‘*Time*’—the afternoon; laid dowu in such texts as ‘when the sun has
just passed the meridian, &c.’

‘*Purity*’—of oneself, of the Brāhmaṇas invited, and of his own
servants.

‘*Qualities of Brāhmaṇas*’—the obtaining of qualified Brāhmaṇas.

All these advantages are such as must be secured; and these are hampered
by having a large company; hence large company becomes a drawback; and
this is involved in inviting too many Brāhmaṇas. *Hence ‘one should not
seek*’—bring together—‘*a large company*.’— (126)

126	A large company destroys these five (advantages) the respectful treatment (of the invited, the propriety of) place and time, purity and (the selection of) virtuous Brahmana (guests); he therefore shall not seek (to entertain) a large company.
