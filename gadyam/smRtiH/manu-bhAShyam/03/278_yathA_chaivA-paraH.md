Just as, for purposes of śrāddha, the latter half of the month is preferable to the former half, so also, the afternoon is preferable to the forenoon.—(278)

‘*Fortner* *halt of the month*’ is the brighter fortnight; and ‘*latter
half*’ is the darker fortnight;—months being counted from the brighter
fortnight of *Caitra* onwards.

Just as, for purposes of Śrāddha, the darker fortnight is preferable
to—is productive of better results than -the brighter fortnight, so is
the afternoon preferable to the forenoon. From the declaration of this
‘preference,’ it follows that in some cases one might perform a
*śrāddha* during the forenoon also.

“As a rule, the illustration should be well known; as a matter of fact,
however, nowhere has the text declared the superiority of the darker
fortnight to the brighter fortnight, for purposes of *Śrāddha*. \[Hence
the illustration is not apt\].”

Some people explain that the said superiority is understood from what
has been said under 276, regarding the ‘darker fortnight’ and ‘days
beginning with the tenth.’ Our explanation, however, is as
follows:—According to the principle laid down in *Mīmāṃsāsūtra* 3. 5.
21, even an unknown fact can serve as an illustration; so that, in the
case in question, from the citation of the illustration itself we may
even deduce the necessary injunction (regarding the performance of
*Sharddhas* ( *Śrāddhas*?) during the darker fortnight).—(278)

*Medhātithi* (P. 297, l. 16)—‘*Vacanāni tvapūrvatvāt*.’—This is Mīmāṃsā
sūtra 3.5.21. The question arising as to whether or not there should be
an ‘eating of remnants’ in the case of the *Soma juice*,—the conclusion
is that there should be the eating of it; and this conclusion is based
upon a passage referring to a totally different subject; which shows
that even an unknown fact can serve as an illustration in support of a
definite conclusion.

This verse is quoted in *Kālaviveka* (p. 366), which explains that the
precise meaning of the verse is that ‘from the three parts into which
the day is divided, forenoon, mid-day and afternoon, the afternoon is
superior to the other two.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 465), which adds that the term
‘*aparāhṇa*’ stands here, not for the fourth part of the day divided
into five parts, but simply for ‘the latter half of the day,’ which is
its etymological meaning;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 373);—in
*Śrāddhakriyakaumudī* (p. 314);—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 236);—in
*Śrāddhakaumudī* (p. 248); and in *Kālamādhava* (p. 109).

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra*. (2.16.45).—‘The afternoon of the darker
fortnight is more commendable.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.226).—‘Having worshipped the Brāhmaṇas *in the
afternoon*, etc.’

*Vyāsa* (Aparārka, p. 465).—‘Three *muhurtas* constitute the morning,
three *muhūrtas* again form the *Saṅgava*; three, *midday*; another
three, *afternoon*.

*Śruti* (Do.).—‘The morning is for the gods, the midday for men and the
afternoon for Pitṛs.’

278	As the second half of the month is preferable to the first half, even so the afternoon is better for (the performance of) a funeral sacrifice than the forenoon.
