Bards, dramatic performers, dancers and singers are called ‘actors.’

‘*One who has broken the vows of continence*’—necessary for the student.

The term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ stands for the *śūdra* woman; her ‘*husband*.’
People think that this refers to a case where there is no other wife;
the meaning being ‘he who is the husband of the Śūdra woman alone, he
who has no wife of any twice-born caste.’

“Whence is this sense got at?”

In another connection, we find a recapitulation of reprehensible
practices, where we read—‘these are men addicted to reprehensible
practices’ (167); the mere marrying of a *Śūdra* woman, which is
sanctioned by all, is not ‘reprehensible;’ but it has been sanctioned
only for one who has already married a wife of the same caste as
himself. Hence, what is excluded here is that husband of the Śūdra woman
who has no wife of the same caste as himself.

‘*The son of a re-married woman*;’—‘*punarbhūḥ*’ is the remarried woman;
described under Discourse 9, in the verse ‘she who has been abandoned by
her husband, etc.’ (9.175).

‘*Who has only one eye*’—whose one eye is maimed.

‘*He in whose house lives the paramour*,’—*i.e*., the paramour of his
lawfully wedded wife. Such a man is despised by reason of his tolerating
such a thing. It is said below (8.317)—‘The abortionist transmits bis
guilt to him who feeds him, and the misbehaved wife transmits hers to
her husband.’—(155)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which (on p.
693) adds the following notes:—‘*Kuśīlava*’ stands for ‘singers and
others,’—‘*Vṛṣalīpati*’ is ‘the husband of a girl who attained puberty
before marriage;’—that person also is to be excluded in whose house a
paramour of his wife’s lives constantly;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
481);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 40), which explains ‘*Kuśīlavaḥ*’
as ‘dancer’.
