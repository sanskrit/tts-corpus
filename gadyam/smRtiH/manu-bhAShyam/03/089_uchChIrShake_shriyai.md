‘*Head*’—is the top-most place, known as the dwelling of the gods; on
this he should make the offering to Śrī; and ‘*on the feet*’—*i.e*., on
the lower side of the house—*Ho Bhadrakālī*;’ the place of dwelling of
this goddess being the East of the door.

Others have explained ‘*head*’ to mean that side of the householder’s
bed where his head lies; and the ‘*feet*’ to be the lower side of the
same. According to this explanation, this oblation may be placed either
on the bedstead or on the ground, on the spot where the householder’s
bed lies.

‘*For Brahman and Vāstoṣpati*.’—Even though these deities have been
coupled together in a copulative compound, yet the two oblations are
distinct, one to Brahman and another to Vāstoṣpati. In cases where two
gods together form the ‘deities,’—as in the case of ‘Agni-Soma’—the two
are taken together or conjointly; for example (*a*) ‘to the two
together’ (as mentioned in 85 above), and ‘to Heaven and Earth
conjointly’ (as mentioned in 86 above). The two mentioned here are to be
treated separately, as they are not known to be companions.

‘*Homestead*’ means the *house*; and it is in the centre of the house
that the offering is to be placed.—(89)

‘*Ucchīrṣake*’—‘Head of the bed’ (‘Others’in Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana);—‘the North-East portion of the house, where the head of the
Vāstupuruṣa lies’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘the place of
the head, well-known as the *Devatāśaraṇa*’ (the N.-E. corner of the
house is what is meant).

‘*Pādataḥ*’—‘the lower portion of the house’ (Medhātithi);—‘the South
West corner of the house, where the Vāstupuruṣa has his feet’
(Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 403), which explains
‘*Ucchīrṣahe*’ as ‘the head of the bedstead lying in the house’—and
‘*Pādataḥ*’ as ‘the foot-end of the bedstead in the house’, and adds
that the formula to be used in making the offering should be as put in
the text ‘*Brahmavāstoṣpatibhyām svāhā*.’

089	Near the head (of the bed) he shall make an offering to Sri (fortune), and near the foot (of his bed) to Bhadrakali; in the centre of the house let him place a Bali for Brahman and for Vastoshpati (the lord of the dwelling) conjointly.
