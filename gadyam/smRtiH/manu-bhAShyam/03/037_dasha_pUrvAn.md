‘*Pitṛs on the ascending side*,’ *i.e*., father, grandfather, and so
forth.

‘*Pitṛs on the descending side*,’ *i.e*., son, grandson, and so forth.

These he ‘*absolves from sins i.e*., saves them from the sufferings of
hell, etc.

Tbe son that is born of the girl married by the Brāhma form ‘*is a
performer* *of* *righteous acts*,’—*i.e*., his deeds are virtuous.

‘*Pitṛs*’—those that have gone over to the other world. The term
‘*pitṛ*’ here stands for *dead persons*; in no other sense could the son
and other descendants be spoken of as one’s ‘*pitṛs*.’

‘*Ten*’— this is construed with both ‘ascendants’ and ‘descendants;’ as
is clear from the man himself being spoken of as ‘the twenty-first.’

This verse is a purely laudatory exaggeration. Hence the question need
not be raised how the man can save from sin his descendants, who are not
yet born. For *ancestors*, freedom from sin is actually brought about by
the proper performance, by the son, of *Śrāddha* and other rites; this
we shall explain under the section on ‘*Śrāddha*.’ All that the
assertion that ‘he absolves from sins ten descendants’ means is that in
his family ten lines of descendants are born sinless.—(37)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 863), where it
explains ‘*Brāhmaṇī*’ as ‘the girl married in the Brāhma form;’ and adds
that the term ‘*pitṛn*’ includes the son and other descendants
also;—also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 487);—in *Aparārka* (p. 88),
which explains ‘*Sukṛta*’ as ‘doing what is enjoined and avoiding what
is forbidden’;—in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 683); and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 227).
