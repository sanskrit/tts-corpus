‘*Of these*’— of the Hearth and the other ‘slaughter-houses.’

‘*For the purpose of expiating*’—*i.e*., for the purpose of removing the
evils proceeding from them.

‘Course’—The ‘course’ meant are—*smearing* of the Hearth, *scraping* of
the grinding-stone, and so forth.

‘*Have been ordained by the great sages*;’—have been declared as to be
performed;—‘*the live great sacrifices*,’ ‘*for householders*’—*i.e*.,
for persons who have entered the householder’s state—the term
‘*grhamedha*’ stands for the Householder’s state.

‘*Daily*’—as no particular period has been specified, we gather that
they are to be performed throughout life; and it is thus that their
compulsory character becomes estsblished.

‘*Great sacrifices*’—this is the name of the rites to be performed.—(69)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Viṣṇu* (59.20).—‘For the expiation of these, one should offer the
sacrifices to Veda, Gods, Bhūtas, Pitṛs and Men.’

*Hārīta* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 389).—‘The Religious Students shake
off the sins of three slaughterings by attending upon the Fire and upon
the Teacher, and by Vedic Study; the Householders and the Recluses shake
off the five by means of the five Pākayajñas; the Renunciates shake off
two by pure knowledge and by Meditation; there, is no shaking off of the
slaughtering caused by the teeth.’

*Saṃvarta* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 387).—‘During the fifth part of the
day, he shall make offerings to Gods, Pitṛs, Men and Insects.’

*Saṃvarta*. (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 388).—‘Day after day the
twice-born shall perform the five great sacrifices; he shall never omit
them.’

*Vyāsa* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 388).—‘Even in times of dire distress,
he shall not omit the Pākayajñas.’

*Jābāli* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 388).—‘Daily he should perform the
worshipping of Gods and Pitṛs, and offerings should be made to Men
also.’

*Devala* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 388).—‘Having set up the Fire, he
shall honour Gods, Pitṛs, Sages, Guests and other strangers who come to
him.’
