Tears make the food go to ghosts, anger to enemies, lie to dogs, touching with the foot to demons, and shaking to sinners.—(230)

अस्यार्थवादः । अश्रुविमोचनं क्रियमाणं **प्रेतान् गमयति** प्रापयति श्राद्धम् । न पितॄणाम् उपकारकं भवति । प्रेताश् चात्र पिशाचवद् भूतविशेषा विवक्षिताः, न त्व् असपिण्डीकृताः संप्रतिमृताः । **रक्षांसि** भूतप्रेतवद् अवगन्तव्यानि । **अरयः** प्रसिद्धाः । तथा **दुष्कृतीन्** दुष्कृताचरणान् पातकिनः ॥ ३.२२० ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse is supplementary to what has gone before in the preceding
verse.

The shedding of tears, when done, makes the Śrāddha-offering go—*i.e*.,
sends it—to ‘*ghosts*’; and it does not become helpful to the Pitṛs. The
term ‘*preta*,’ ‘ghost,’ here stands for a particular class of beings,
of the same kind as *Piśācas*; and not. for persons recently dead and
not yet joined to their ancestors.

‘*Demons*’—also should be understood in the same manner as ‘ghosts.’

‘*Enemies*’—well-known.

‘*Sinners*’—People addicted to sinful deeds.—(230)

*Devala* (Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 1030).—‘If there is some flaw
in cleanliness, Rākṣasas take away all that is sacrificed or offered or
given away or eaten, all *japa*, all austerities and all
learning;—similarly also what is given in anger, or what is eaten in
hurry, the Rākṣasas take away both these;—having invited the Pitṛs, one
shall do nothing that may be improper; therefore one shall perform the
Śrāddha with speech and anger under control;—one shall not be angry with
any one, even though there be cause for it; what pleases the Pitṛs is
the Śrāddha that is free from anger.’

230	A tear sends the (food) to the Pretas, anger to his enemies, a falsehood to the dogs, contact with his foot to the Rakshasas, a shaking to the sinners.
