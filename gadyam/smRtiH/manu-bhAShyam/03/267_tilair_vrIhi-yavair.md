The mention of the sesamum and other grains is not meant to be
preclusive of other grains; it is meant only to be indicative of the
peculiar results following from their offering; the sense being that
when those are offered in the right manner, the ancestors remain
satisfied for one year.

‘*Proper*,’ ‘*ancestors*,’ ‘*men’s*.’—These terms are purely
reiterative, put in for the purpose of filling up the metre.—(267)
