‘*That has happened to come*’—*i.e*., who has come of his own accord,
and has not been invited; one who has been invited is not a ‘guest.’ The
proper place where the guest is to arrive shall be described later
on—‘where the wife and the Fires are, &c., &c.’ (103).

‘*Water and seat he should offer*;’—first of all he should offer water
for the washing of his feet, and then the seat; ‘*and also food*.’

‘*Prepared to the best of his ability*;’—this qualifies ‘food.’ The
meaning is that he should prepare the food with special care and then
offer it—feed him with it.

‘*According to rule*’—*i.e*., that offering which is
preceded—supported—by injunction; *i.e*., that which is sanctioned by
scripture.—(99)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 441), which explains
‘*samprāptāya*’ as ‘one who has happened to come of his own accord, *i*.
*e*., without invitation’; and ‘*vidhipūrvakam*’ as ‘in the manner
prescribed for the entertaining of guests’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 433).

Between verses 99 and 100, *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 441) quotes the
following two additional verses—

> annaṃ hutvā vidhānena yatpuṇyaphalamaśanūte \|  
> tena tus?yaṃ viśiṣṭaṃ vā brāhmaṇe tarpite phalam \|\|  
> mantr?akarmaviparyāsād? duritād? durgatādapi \|  
> tatphalaṃ naśyate karturidaṃ na śraddhayā h?tam \|\|

and adds the following explanations:—‘*annam hutvā*’—*i*. *e*., in the
fire;—‘*mantra &c*.’.—*i.e*., ‘from that sin which would accrue from the
misuse of Mantras and Rites, and from the delinquencies of the
Agent’;—‘*tatphalam*’—the result following from the Homa;—‘*Idam
na*’—the construction is that ‘whatever is offered to the guest with due
respect, in the shape of all this, seat and the rest, is never lost’.

*Gautama*. (5.32.34).—‘To the guest not learned in the Veda, water for
washing the feet, an offering of water and also special kinds of food,
always specially cooked.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (4.12).—‘When a person comes to his house, he should welcome
him, rising from his seat and offering him a seat and a bed, and
receiving him with true and agreeable words, free from jealousy.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.4.13-16).—‘The master and mistress of the
house should not refuse to receive anyone who comes to seek for anything
at the proper time; if they have nothing else to offer, they should
offer a place, water, grass and agreeable words.........To a Brāhmaṇa
not learning or learned in the Veda, he shall only offer seat, water and
food and he shall not rise to receive him.’

*Āpastamba* (6.7-14 ).—‘ Having gone up before him, and having met him,
he shall offer to him a seat...... He shall wash his feet; some people
hold that it is only the Śūdra householder and his wife that are to do
this... He shall offer to him water in an earthen vessel, say some...
But if the guest is one who has completed his study, no water is to be
offered to him......... Having pleased him, he shall satisfy him with
sweetly flavoured food.’ \[So on, there are very full directions.\]

*Viṣṇu* (67.45).—‘In the morning and in the evening, he shall offer to
the guest both seat and water, as also food to the best of his power,
after having received him with honour.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.107).—‘To the guest one should make offerings to the
best of one’s capacity; and in the evening the guest is not to be
deprived of sweet words, place and water.’
