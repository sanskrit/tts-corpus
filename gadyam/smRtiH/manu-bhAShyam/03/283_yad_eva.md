<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The present verse sets forth an option to the daily *Śrāddha* that has
been prescribed in connection with the ‘Five Sacrifices.’

The ‘offering of water’ that is made after bath,—by that he obtains the
reward of the offering to the Pitṛs. That is, it is not absolutely
necessary to do what has been said (in 3.83) regarding the feeding of at
least one Brāhmaṇa and the rest of it. It is only the *Water-offering*
that must be made.—(283).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 391) in support of
the view that in case one is unable to perform all the three rites of
*Tarpaṇa, Śrāddha* and *Bali*, if he performs even one of them, he is
saved from the sin of neglecting the ‘offerings to the Pitṛs’;—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 946).

*Baudhāyana* (2.6.3).—‘Day after day, one shall moke offerings out of
the water-vessel; even so is the Pitṛyajña accomplished.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.13.1).—‘By the wateroffering is accomplished
the offering to gods, the offering to Pitṛs and also Vedic Study.’

283	Even when a Brahmana, after bathing, satisfies the manes with water, he obtains thereby the whole reward for the performance of the (daily) Sraddha.
