Just as all Creatures subsist by deriving support from air, so do the other states subsist by deriving support from the Housohelder.—(77)

The present verse proceeds to indicate, in another way, the necessity of
performing the Great Sacrifices.

All creatures subsist by desiring support from ‘*Air*’—*i.e*., from
life-breath; no one can live without the life-breath; in fact, the act
of ‘living’ consists in the bearing of the life-breath.

The term ‘*creatures*’ stands for all living beings.

The epithet ‘*all*’ has been added with a view to the fact that the
subsistence of even gods and sages, who are endowed with superior
powers, is dependent upon Air.

Similarly, the Householder is like Air for persons in all other states.
Hence, what the Injunction means is that the Householder should act in
such a manner that all others may derive their subsistence from him.

Though the presence of the term ‘*other*’ would indicate that persons
other than householders were meant, yet the text is not meant to exclude
the householder from the said support, specially because the making of
gifts to guests and others has been specially prescribed for the
*Snātaka*. Hence the term ‘*other*’ is meant to indicate that the other
states are on the same footing as the state of the Householder. Nor has
it been declared anywhere that the Householder should not support
himself, or should not take steps for the supporting of the members of
his family \[and all this would excluded from his support if ‘other
states’ stood for states other than that of the Householder.\]

The compound ‘*itarāśramāḥ*’ is to be expounded as a *Karmadhāraya*
compound.—(77)

077	As all living creatures subsist by receiving support from air, even so (the members of) all orders subsist by receiving support from the householder.
