पितुर् नामसंकीर्तनेन तदीयावाहनपिण्डदानब्राह्मण्भोजनानि लक्ष्यन्ते । **कीर्तयेत् प्रपितामहम्** । जीवते पितामहाय न दद्यात् । किं तर्हि ततः पूर्वाभ्यां "पितुः पितृभ्यो निपृणीयात्" इति स्मरन्ति ॥ ३.२११ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The pronouncing of the Father’s name stands here for his invitation,
offering of the ball and the feeding of Brāhmaṇas.

‘*Should mention the great-grandfather*;’—*i.e*., he should not make any
offering to the living grandfather; it should be made to his previous
ancestors; as it has been declared that ‘one should make offerings to
his father’s ancestors.’—(221)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 542), which, in explaining
the phrase ‘*pituḥ svanāma saṅkīrtya*,’ says that in offering the
Ball—to his own great-grandfather, *e.g*., he should refer to him as
‘the grandfather of my father, so aṇd so’;—also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p.
362) in support of the view that if the grandfather be living, the
offerings; should be made to the Father, the great-grandfather and the
great-great-grandfather;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 553), which
notes that ‘*nāmakīrtaṇa*,’ ‘mentioning of the name’ stands for
‘offering the Śrāddha’ and ‘*prapitāmaha*,’ ‘great-grandfather’ means
the ‘great-great-grandfather’ also.
