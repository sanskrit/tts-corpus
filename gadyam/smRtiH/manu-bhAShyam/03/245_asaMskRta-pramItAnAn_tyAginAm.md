In connection with infants who have not completed their third year, it
is going to be said that ‘cremation shall not be performed for him;’ it
is these that are spoken of here as ‘*those who have died without
sacraments*.’

‘*The remnant*’—contained in the dishes; as also ‘*what is scattered on
the Kuśa*’ forms their ‘*share*’ The term ‘*bhāgadheya*’ is the same as
‘*bhāga*.’

This does not mean that these persons are not helped by the *śrāddha*.

^(‘)*Those who* *hare* *abandoned*’—their elders. Or, ‘those who have
abandoned the ladies of their family, without finding any fault in
them.’ According to the former explanation, the term ‘*Kulayoṣitām*’ is
to be construed by itself, and taken to mean ‘unmarried maidens.’

For the reason stated, the remnant should be offered to the persons
mentioned.

It would not be right to raise the question—“Since the remnant would be
unclean, how could it be offered as the said share?”—because, in view of
this very text, there is no uncleanliness attaching to the remnant; just
as there is none in the case of the remnant of Soma-juice (at the
Soma-sacrifices).—(245)

This verse is quoted in *Varṣakriyākaumudī*, (p. 359), as enumerating
those entitled to the scattered food;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p.
562), which explains ‘*kulayoṣitām tyāginām*’ as ‘those who abandon the
ladies of their family without cause’, and adds that the food scattered
in the dish is for those who have died without sacraments, while that on
the ground is for the slaves;—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 275);—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1512), which adds the following
notes:—‘*asaṃskṛta*’ stands for those whose Upanayana has not been done,
and also the unmarried girls,—‘*tyāginaḥ*’ are
suicides,—‘*kulayoṣitām*’, those ladies to whom water-offerings have not
been made;—or ‘*kulayoṣitām tyāginām*’ may be taken together, meaning
‘those who have abandoned their wives and ladies without cause.’

‘*Tyāginām kulayoṣitām*’—‘For those who abandon their elders *and* for
unmarried maidens; or to those who have abandoned the ladies of their
family, without fault’ (Medhātithi);—‘For women who have forsaken their
families’ (Govindarāja);—‘suicides and childless women’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘For
ascetics and...’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 376) without
any comment;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 504), which explains ‘*bhāgadheyam*’
as ‘share’; and adds that what is meant is that ‘for those persons of
his family who have died without Upanayana, and for those who have
forsaken the ladies of his family or such others as should not be
forsaken,—one should assign the food left in the dish in which the
Brāhmaṇas have eaten, as also that which has been scattered on the
grass’.

*Viṣṇu* (81.22).—\[Reproduces Manu.\]

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.20).—‘For those persons of one’s family who may have died
before the performance of their sacramental rites,—Manu has laid down
the share in the form of the remnants and the scatterings.’

*Laghu-Āśvalāyana* (23.90-91).—‘Having shaken the vessels, and
pronouncing the syllable *svasti*, he shall throw on each of the spots
sesamum and washed rice, and then scatter food also, for those of his
Pitṛs who may have died without, sacraments.’

245	The remnant (in the dishes), and the portion scattered on Kusa grass, shall be the share of deceased (children) who received not the sacrament (of cremation) and of those who (unjustly) forsook noble wives.
