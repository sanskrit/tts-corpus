<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

After food, drink and water for sipping have been offered, the guests
should be questioned—with the words ‘have you eaten well?’

According to another *Smṛti*, the question should be put by the host,
food in hand. It is the nature of some people that if the food is not
near at hand, they do not ask for it, even though they may have desire
for it, fearing the trouble they would cause; but if the food is close
by, they take it.

‘*After they have been fully satisfied, he shall make them wash*.’

Others have explained this to mean that the guests should be put the
question—‘Are you fully satisfied?’ And when they have ascertained the
fact of their having been fully satisfied, they should be further
propitiated by the question—‘Have you dined well?’ It is going to be
declared (under 254) that ‘at the rite in honour of the Pitṛs one should
say *Have you dined well?*’

‘*When they ham washed, he shall say &c*.’—‘*Where you choose*’—*i.e*.,
at either of the two places,—here or at your own house, you may take
your rest, in any manner you choose.—(251)

*Viṣṇu* (73. 25-26).—‘After the Brāhmaṇas have eaten and become fully
satisfied, he shall sprinkle water with grass on the food, with mantra
‘*Māmekṣeṣṭha*,’—scatter the food near the leavings,—ask the Brāhmaṇas,
*Are you fully satisfied*—and having made them sit facing the north, he
shall offer them water for rinsing the mouth; after that he shall
thoroughly wash the spot where Śrāddha had been offered;—he shall do all
this with kuśa in hand,—going round the Brāhmaṇas facing the east with
the mantra *Yanme rama*, etc., he shall honour them with such gifts as
may be within his power, and address to them the words *Abhiramantu
bhavantaḥ*; on which they should say *Abhiratāḥ smaḥ devāśca
pitaraśca*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.242).—‘Taking up the food, saying *Vriptāḥ sthaḥ*, he
shall obtain their permission and scatter the food on the ground and
pour water once.’

*Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (4.8.22).—‘Having asked *sampannam* (Is it
completed?), he shall gather all the food that has been used and having
taken out of it just what may be needed for the *Sthālīpāka* and *Piṇḍa*
offerings, the rest he shall hand over.’
