‘*Asterism*’ is constellation; one who bears the name of one of these;
such as ‘*Ārdrā*,’ ‘*Jyeṣṭhā*,’ and the like.

‘*Bearing the name of a tree*’—such as ‘Śiṃśapā,’ ‘*Āmalakī*,’ and so
forth.

‘*River*’—the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā; she who bears these names.

The term “*ṛkṣavṛkṣanadī*” is to be expounded as a copulative compound;
which with the following term ‘*nāman*’ forms a genitive *Tatpuruṣa*
compound; and these, along with the term ‘nāman’ repeated, form a
*Bahuvrīhi* compound; the repeated term ‘*nāman*’ being dropped.

‘*Having her name after a low caste*’— such as ‘*Barbarī*’

‘*Śabarī*’ and the like.

‘*Mountains*’— such as the Vindhyā, the Himalaya, and the rest.

This compound (‘*parvatanāmikām*’) also is to be expounded as the
former; and has the ‘*ka*’ affix added to it.

‘*Named after a bird*’— snch as ‘*Śukī*’ ‘*Sārikā*,’ and the like.

‘*Serpent*,’ snake; one who is named after it; such as ‘*Vyālī*,’
‘*Bhujaṅgī*.’

‘*Slave*’— such names as ‘*Dāsī*,’ ‘*Bālī*.’

‘*Inspiring terror*’—that which causes fear; such as *Ḍākinī*,’
‘*Rākṣasī*.’

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 732), where
‘*ṛkṣa*’ is explained as ‘asterism;’—and ‘*antya*’ as ‘*mleccha*;’—in
*Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 149) to the same effect as the preceding
verse;’—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Lakṣaṇa, p. 120), where ‘*antya*’ is
explained as ‘*antyaja*,’ *i.e*., *cāṇḍāla*;—in *Aparārka* (p. 78) as
indicating the unmarriageability of girls with the wrong type of
names;—in *Samkāramayūkha* (p. 74);—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 510),
which explains ‘*antya*’ as bearing a Mleccha name;—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 201), which explains ‘*ṛkṣa*’ as ‘*nakṣatra*,’ ‘*antya*’
as ‘*mleccha*,’ and ‘*bhīṣaṇā*’ as terrifying;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Saṃskāra, p. 50a).
