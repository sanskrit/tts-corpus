अस्य प्रतिषेधविधेः फलम् आह । पङ्क्तिम् अर्हन्तीति पङ्क्त्याः । न पङ्क्त्याः **अपङ्क्त्याः** । दण्ड्यादिदर्शनाद् रूपसिद्धिः । तेभ्यो **दाने** **यः** **फलोदयः** फलोत्पत्तिर् **भवति** **दातुः**, तं सर्वम् इदानीं ब्रवीम्य् अवहिता भवतेति ॥ ३.१५९ ॥

The author states the result of the prohibitive injunction just put
forward.

‘*Paṅktya*’ means ‘those who are worthy of the line;—those who are not
so, are ‘*apaṅktya*;’ the ‘*yat*’ affix being added by virtue of the
term ‘*paṅkti*’ occurring in the ‘*daṇḍādi*’ group.

The results that accrue, from giving to such persons, to the giver,—all
that I am going to describe; do listen with attention.—(169)

**(verses 3.169-170)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (13.90, 11).—‘O Yudhiṣṭhira, that offering to the gods
which is eaten by the twice-born men ‘unfit for company’ goes to the
Rākṣasas; so say the teachers of the Veda.’

169	I will fully declare what result the giver obtains after death, if he gives food, destined for the gods or manes, to a man who is unworthy to sit in the company.
