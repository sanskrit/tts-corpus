One should not regard as “guest” a Brāhmaṇa who lives in the same village or who is a companion. He should regard him as such when he arrives at his house, or where the wife and the fires are at the time.—(103)

One who fives in the same village is not a ‘guest,’ even though he may
happen to come just at the time of the ‘Vaiśvadeva’ offerings.

‘*Companion*’—a fellow-student, other than one’s ‘friend;’ the rule
regarding the entertaining of the latter will come later—‘the Vaiśya and
the Śūdra and one’s friend, &c., &c.’ (Verse 110).

It appears right to take the term ‘*sāṅgatika*’ as excluding the man who
is in the habit of meeting all men on terms of equality, entertaining
them with jokes ami stories,—oven though he be such as has never been
met before.

For the Householder, when away from home, no one can be a ‘guest,’ even
though he may fulfil all the conditions of one; one is to be regarded as
such only when he ‘*arrives at one’s house*;’ *i.e*., to the place where
one lives permanently, that which is called his ‘abode.’ But even when
the man is away from home, if his wife and Fires happen to be there,
then the Brāhmaṇa arriving will be his ‘guest,’ even though he himself
may not be there. Hence the householder should provide for the
entertaining of guests during his absence, in the same manner as he does
for the maintenance of the Fires and the performance of the
*Darśa-Pūrṇmāsa* and other periodical sacrifices.

The term ‘or’ implies that (*a*) when the man goes on a journey taking
his wife and the fires with him, then, even during his stay in another
village, if some one arrives, he should be treated as a ‘guest;”—(*b*)
that the same is the case at his own house, during his absence, if his
wife and Fires are there that hence, when one goes out with his wife,
but leaves the Fires at home, the rule regarding the entertaining of
guests does not apply.

The term ‘or’ is to be construed with ‘should regard’ not as between the
‘wife’ and the ‘fires.’—(103)

‘*Sāṅgatikam*’—‘Fellow-student, other than a *friend*; or one who is in
the habit of meeting all men on terms of equality, entertaining, them
with jokes and stories.’ \[Medhātithi; whom Buhler quotes wrongly by
including ‘the Vaiśya or a Śūdra or a friend’ in the latter explanation;
the word ‘*vaiśyaśūdrau sahhā cheti*’ stands for verse 110, where,
Medhātithi says, ‘the rule regarding the entertaining of a *Friend* will
come in’\];—‘One who makes a living by telling wonderful or laughable
stories and the like’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘one who
comes on account of his relationship to the Householder’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Bhāryā yatrāgnayaḥ*’—‘Where the wife and the fires are at the time’
(Medhātithi);—‘when the man who has arrived is accompanied by his Wife
and Fires’ (Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa). Buhler is again in the wrong in
translating Kullūka’s view. What Kullūka says is “*etena
bhāryāgnirahitasya pravāsino nātithitvamiti bodhitam*”—*i.e*., ‘what is
meant is that the character of a *guest* does not belong to that
wanderer from home, who is devoid of wife and fires’; and *not* (as
Buhler puts it) that ‘a Householder who has neither (wife or fires) need
not entertain guests.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 353), which adds
the following notes:—An inhabitant of the same village, even though he
may arrive in the character of a guest, is not to be entertained as
such;—similarly, the ‘*Sāṅgatika*,’ *i.e*., ‘an old acquaintance,’—is
not to be treated as a guest, if he happens to arrive as one;—an arrival
is to be treated as a guest only when he comes to the house—either his
own or some one else’s—where the Householder’s ‘wife and fires’ happen
to be at the time.

103	One must not consider as a guest a Brahmana who dwells in the same village, nor one who seeks his livelihood by social intercourse, even though he has come to a house where (there is) a wife, and where sacred fires (are kept).
