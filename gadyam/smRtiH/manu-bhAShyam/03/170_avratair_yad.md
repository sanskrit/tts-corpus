Demons indeed consume the food that is eaten by Brāhmaṇas deviod of self-restraint, by such as those who have superseded their elder brother and the like, or by others that are unworthy of company.—(170)

‘*Devoid of self-restraint*’—uncontrolled; whose practices are not
controlled by the scriptures.

‘*Those who have superseded their elder brother*,’ and the like, are, in
fact, outside the pale of the scriptures; yet they have been mentioned
here with a view to differentiate them from others, and also to indicate
the gravity of their offence.

‘*Others that are unworthy of company*’—such as the blind man, the man
affected with elephantiasis, and so forth.

The food that is eaten by those people, at a *Śrāddha*, is consumed by
‘demons’—the enemies of gods,—and not by one’s ancestors. That is to
say, the *Śrāddha* becomes entirely useless.

The mention of ‘*demons*’ is a purely deprecatory exaggeration.—(1 *7*

‘*Avrataiḥ*’—‘Devoid of self-restraint’ (Medhātithi);—‘who have not
fulfilled the vows of studentship’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘who do not observe the rules laid down for the
Accomplished Student’.

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 471 and 493).

170	The Rakshasas, indeed, consume (the food) eaten by Brahmanas who have not fulfilled the vow of studentship, by a Parivettri and so forth, and by other men not admissible into the company.
