**यद् यद्** इति वीप्सायाम् अप्रतिषिद्धं सर्वम् अन्नम् अनुजानाति । **विधिवत् सम्यक्** शब्दानुवादः । **श्रद्धासमन्वित** इत्य् एतद् अत्र विधीयते । श्रद्दया दातव्यम् । तथा दत्तम् **अनन्तम् अक्षयं भवति पितॄणां** परलोके । **अनन्तम्** इति वा कालावधिनिषेधः । **अक्षयम्** इति मात्रया व्ययाभावम् आह । सर्वकालं भवति प्रभूतं च ॥ ३.२६५ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Whatever*.’—This term sanctions the offering of everything, not
actually prohibited.

‘*According to rule*’ is a reiteration of what has been said by means of
the term, ‘*in the right manner*.’

‘*Endowed with faith*’— This is what is actually prescribed in the
present verse:—‘one should make the offering with due faith.’

What is given in this manner ‘*becomes endless and inexhaustible for the
Pitṛs in the other world*.’ ‘Endless’ may be taken as denying all
limitation of time;—‘*Inexhaustible*’ denies non-diminishing of
quantity; the sense being ‘it lasts for all time and becomes large in
quantity.’—(275)

*Baudhāyana* (2.62-65).—‘The gods desirous of purity do not accept the
offerings of the faithless. The gods discussed the relative merits of
the person who is pure but faithless and he who is not pure but full of
faith, and came to the conclusion that both were equal; hut Prajāpati
said to them: “They are not equal; there is great difference; as the
Śrāddha offered by the faithless is damned; what is sanctified by faith
is distinctly superior.” In this connection, they have the following
saying—Want of faith is a great sin; faith is the highest austerity;
therefore, what is offered without faith, the gods never accept.’

*Mahābhārata* (13.188.72, 79).—‘Those men who offer Śrāddhas with due
faith save their forefathers from the most terrible hell; he who
performs the Śrāddha with faith becomes freed from the debt owing to the
Pitṛs.’

275	Whatever (a man), full of faith, duly gives according to the prescribed rule, that becomes in the other world a perpetual and imperishable (gratification) for the manes.
