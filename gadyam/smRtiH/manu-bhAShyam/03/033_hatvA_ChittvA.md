‘*Forcibly*;’—*i.e*., having subdued the guardians of the girl, if one
carries her away by force, this is called the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ form. This is
all that is meant to be stated here. ‘*Having beaten*,’ etc., is a mere
descriptive re-iteration; for it is always understood that, while the
bridegroom is forcibly taking away the girl, if some one seeks to stop
him, he shall beat them and do the rest of it. But if, knowing the great
strength of the abductor, her guardians, through fear, let her go,—then
also it is a Rākṣasa form of marriage; and it is not a necessary
condition of this form that the *beating*, *etc*., must be done.

‘*Having beaten*’—by means of sticks, etc.

‘*Wounded*’— cutting limbs by strokes of the sword and other weapons.

‘*Pierced*’—walls and forts.

‘*Crying out and weeping*;’—*i.e*., unwilling girl. This is what
distinguishes this from the ‘*Gāndharva*’ form. ‘*Crying out*’ stands
for such loud wailings as—‘there is none to protect me, I am being taken
away, save me,’ and so forth: while ‘*weeping*’ stands for shedding
tears, which is the characteristic of all frightened women.—(33)

This verse is quoted in ‘*Vīramitrodaya*’ (Saṃskāra, p. 856), where the
following explanation is given—‘*Hatvā*’—‘having beaten, those
obstructing him’;—‘*Chittvā*’—having cut off, the heads of the
obstructors’;—‘*Bhittvā*’—‘having pierced, with strokes of
weapons’;—‘*Krośantīm*’—calling for her relations;—all this indicates
fighting.

The second half is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 129) in support of
the view that what distinguishes the *Rākṣasa* form is *forcible
abduction*.

The verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 685);—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra,:p. 229), which explains ‘*prosahya*’ as ‘by force’.
