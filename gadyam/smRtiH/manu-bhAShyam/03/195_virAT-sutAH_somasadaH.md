All these verses are laudatory descriptions relating to *Śrāddhas*; as
they are all construable together. The ‘Pitṛs of the Sādhyas’ have not
been laid down as the recipients of *Śrāddhas*; specially because they
are gods, and also because the *Sādhyas* also, who are themselves gods,
are not entitled to the performance of *Śrāddhas*; for the simple reason
that they are not such as. can be directed to do an act. Gods cannot be
directed to do an act; for, if they were, this would deprive them of
their god-like character. If gods were entitled to the performance of an
act, they would be regarded as the ‘ *doer*;’ and the ‘doer’ or ‘agent’
could never be the ‘recipient;’ while, in reality, the very nature of
the gods consists in their being ‘recipients’ (of sacrifices).

The sous of Virāj are the *Somasads*; and these are the ‘Pitṛs of the
Sādhyas.’

\[The sense of all this laudatory description is as follows\]—This rite
in honour of the Pitṛs must always be performed; since, even the
*Sādhyas*, who are *gods*, and as such, have accomplished all that they
had to do, worship their Pitṛs.

The *Agniṣvāttas*, who are the Pitṛs of Agni and other Gods, relish the
cake and milk and rice cooked on fire.

‘*Mārīcāḥ*’—sons of Marīci.

‘*Lokaviśrutāḥ*’—famed in the world.—(195)
