‘*By men unworthy of company*’—as described above—‘*defiled*’—rendered
defective,—‘*company*’—assembly—by which *Brāhmaṇas* ‘*become
purified*’—rendered free from defilement,—to those ‘*listen*’— as
described in the coming verses;—‘*full*’—the description that is being
given by me fully.

The remaining words are purely laudatory reiterations. What is meant is
that the ‘sanctifier of company,’ by reason of the excellence of his
qualities, removes the defects of other persons also by dining with
them; just as the impure man, dining with others, makes even faultless
men defective.

This verse does not sanction the feeding of men unworthy of company. All
that it means is, that one should always seek for the ‘sanctifier of
company;’ and that if one such person has been found, one might
feed,—even though it he futile to do so,—those who have not been
carefully examined to three degrees of ancestors, if they are not found
to be marked by any perceptible disqualifications. It is with this end
in view that the author provides the description of the ‘sanctifier of
company.’—(183)

*Mahābhārata* (13. 90, 24).—‘O chief of the Bharatas, these should be
regarded as *sanctifiers of company*; these I am going to describe with
reasons for the same; do please examine such Brāhmaṇas.’

*Mahābhārata* (37).—‘These sanctify the company so far as they see them;
that is why they are called the *sanctifiers of company*.’
