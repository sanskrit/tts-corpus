What is done in fire, in the form of pouring the libation, with the
words, ‘*agnaye svadhā namaḥ*’ (‘this is an offering for Agni,’) should
be done in the ‘*apasavya*’ form.

Some people explain the term ‘*apasavya*’ to mean that the act should be
done with the right hand, not with the left, nor by both; in view of the
prohibition contained in verse 225 below. This, according to these
people, has been added, in view of it being thought possible to do the
act with both hands.

This, however, is not right. Because the ‘*apasavya form*’ here enjoined
is in reference to the ‘serial performance’ of those libations that are
poured into Fire; hence, what is meant is that the libations should be
poured in such a manner that they tend *towards the South, not towards
the North*;—this latter being what is right in the case of offerings to
the gods. That is to say, when the sacrificial material is being poured
with the ladle, one should be facing the South, and not the North—this
rule standing on the same footing as that which prescribes the pouring
of water-libations to the Pitṛs in such a manner that it flows between
the thumb and the index-finger.

The epithet ‘*entire*’ indicates that all such acts as the placing of
the material in the dish, and so forth, should be done in the
‘*apasavya*’ form.

‘*He should offer water with the hand in the apasavya position*,’

‘*Śanaiḥ*’ (for ‘*bhuvi*’) is another reading.

The purpose of this rule is that it has been emphasised with a view to
preclude the use of silver implements (according to 202).

‘*Āvṛt*’ stands for ‘*Āvṛtti*,’ ‘repetition.’—(214)

‘*Apasavyam*’—‘In such a manner that they tend towards the South’
(Medhātithi);—‘Passing the sacrificial thread over the right shoulder
under the left arm’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘with the right hand’ (‘others’ in
Medhātithi, which he rejects).

‘*Āpasavyena hastena*’—‘With the right hand’ (Kullūka). This
explanation, which Buhler wrongly attributes to ‘others’ (in
Medhātithi), is really put forth by Medhātithi in connection with the
former term ‘*Apasavyam*’, and not the second expression ‘*Āpasavyena
hastena*.’ Nor is it right to say that according to Medhātithi this
second expression means ‘out of the Tīrtha of the right hand which is
sacred to the Manes’; because, as a matter of fact, Medhātithi has given
no explanation of this expression at all. Buhler seems to have got an
imperfect copy of Medhātithi; or did he not pay careful attention to
reading it?

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 601) without any
comment;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1321) as distinctly laying down
the ‘*Prācīnāvīta*’.

*Laghu-Āśvalāyana Smṛti* (13.73-74).—‘On the spot which is sloping
towards the south-east, he shall draw a line with the mantra *Apahata*,
etc.; he shall spread *kuśa* over it and then adopting the *Apasavya*
form, he shall sprinkle water over it with the mantra *Śundhantām*,
etc.; and then upon the kuśa he shall offer the balls.’

214	After he has performed (the oblations) in the fire, (and) the whole series of ceremonies in such a manner that they end in the south, let him sprinkle water with his right hand on the spot (where the cakes are to be placed).
