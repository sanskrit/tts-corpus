उभाभ्यां हस्ताभ्यां स्वयं गृहीत्वा **अन्नस्य वर्धितम्** अन्नेन पूर्णं भाजनं **विप्रान्तिके** रसवत्यगारादीनाम्, यत्र ब्राह्मणा भोज्यन्ते, तस्मिन् देशे **उपनिक्षिपेत्** ब्राह्मणानां समीपे स्थापयेत् ।

- <u>अन्ये</u> तु व्यचक्षते । **वर्धितं** परिवर्तुलम् अन्नम् उच्यते । **तद् विप्रान्तिके पितॄन् ध्यायन्** "तुभ्यम् इदम्" इति ध्यात्वा **निक्षिपेत्,** यथा विकिरम् ।

With both hands he should himself take up ‘*the supply of
food*,’—*i.e*., the dish supplied with food,—from the kitchen-house, to
the place where the Brāhmaṇas are being fed, and—‘*place it near the
Brāhmaṇas*.’

Others explain the verse as follows:—The term ‘*vardhitam*,’ ‘*supply*,’
stands for the *massed food*; this he should place before the Brāhmaṇas,
‘thinking of his *Pitṛs*’—*i.e*., in his mind saying, ‘this is for
you’—he should scatter the food.

This is not right. Later on (228), our author is going to declare that
‘having brought up the food, he should serve it all;’ hence the
‘*placing*’ mentioned in the present verse must simply mean the bringing
of the food from another place and depositing it near the
Brāhmaṇas.—(224)

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1368), which has the
following notes:—‘*Annasya vardhitam*’, ‘pot filled with food’, should
be brought from the kitchen, with both hands, and placed before the
Brāhmaṇa, in a clean place,—‘*śanakaiḥ*’ gently, so that the pot does
not break or make any sound,—‘*Svayam*’, himself,—this is the best
course; other Smṛti texts permit of the cooking etc. being done by the
wife;—in ‘*Śrādhakriyākaumudī* (p. 158), which explains ‘*vardhitam*’ a
s ‘filled’;—it adds that the man should himself place the vessel near
the Brāhmaṇa on the square platform made for that purpose and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 545), which explains ‘*annasya*’ as
‘*annena*’ and ‘*vardhitam*’ as ‘filled’.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 229), which adds the following
notes:—The genitive ending in ‘*annasya*’ has the sense of the
instrumental;—‘*vardhitam*’ means ‘filled’, which qualifies the
‘*pātra*, receptacle’ understood;—‘*upanikṣipet*’—keep near, for
serving; *i*. *e*., the food should not be served into the dish directly
from the cooking-pot; the cooking pot should be brought near the dish,
and placed on the ground; the food should be served on the dish with the
two hands, with which another vessel is held.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 492), which adds the explanation that
‘the man should carry with his own hands the vessel which has been
filled with food in a place other than the one where the Brāhmaṇas are
to be fed, to a place near the Brāhmaṇas and keep it there gently, all
the time thinking of his Pitṛs’;—‘*annasya vardhitam*’ meaning that
quantity of food which has been set aside as the share of one feeder.

*Kālikāpurāṇa* (Do. p. 1369).—‘Self-controlled, and with speech
suppressed, he shall, with his two hands, place the dish before the
Brāhmaṇa and then serve out the articles of food.’

*Yama* (Do.).—‘Bringing up the food, he shall feed the Brāhmaṇas with
care,—serving to them cooked rice, soup, butter, vegetables, meat,
curds, milk and honey.’

*Śaunaka*.—‘ Bringing up all the food that has been cooked, he shall
begin to serve each article separately.’

*Paiṭhīnasi*.—‘Having dressed up the Brāhmaṇas, he shall serve to them
meat, cakes, curds, butter, milk-pudding, mixed rice, and preparations
