‘*Healers* physicians.

^(‘)*Temple-attendants*’—those who attend upon idols.

These two are prohibited only as means of living. Healing and serving
idols, when done entirely with a righteous motive (and not as a means of
living), are not reprehensible.

‘*Meat-sellers*’—Butchers.

If we read these words with the Accusative ending, then they have to be
construed with the verb of the preceding verse.

‘*Those living by trade*’—*i.e*., by improper trade; improper
merchandise shall be described under Discourse 10,—those who live by
such trade.

‘*Should be avoided*’—at both kinds of rites.

Meat-selling is reprehensible, even when done with a *righteous* motive.
For instance, when one man has *got* meat and another man has need for
it;—the former man who has got the meat stands in need *of* butter for
oblations; *and he exchanges his* meat with the other man’s butter;
*this exchange is done* ‘with a righteous motive,’ and *exchange also is
called* ‘selling;’ *hence* those also *become* excluded who do such
meat-selling, even with a righteous motive.—(152)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which omits
the second half of this and the whole of the next verse, though
continuing with verse 154;—the whole verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 560);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 9a);—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 480).

*Parāśaramādhava* (on p. 689) adds the notes that the ‘*chikitsaka*’ is
‘one who administers medicine either gratuitously or by way of
living,’—this work being specially forbidden for the Brāhmaṇa,—the
‘*Devalaka*’ is ‘one who, for three years, worships the gods as a means
of making money,’ such being the definition provided by a text quoted
from Devala,—the ‘*Māṃsavikrayī*’ intended to be excluded is one who
sells meat, *even in abnormal times of distress*,—because as regards
*normal times*, living by any kind of trade is forbidden by the next
phrase, which prohibition does not apply to abnormal times, during which
the ‘livelihood of the Vaiśya’ has been permitted for the Brāhmaṇa.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 450), which explains that the
‘*Chikitsaka*’ means one who makes a living by administering medicines,
not one who does it by way of charity;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.
40).
