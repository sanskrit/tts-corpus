The mutual union of the bride and bridegroom, through love is to be known as the “Gāndharva” form; it has sexual intercourse for its end and it has its source in lust.—(32).

**इच्छया** च वर्स्य कुमार्याश् च प्रीत्या परस्परसंयोग एकप्रदेशे संगमनम् । तस्येयं निन्दा **मैथुन्यः कामसंभवः** । मिथुनप्रयोजनो मैथुनः, तस्मै हितो **मैथुन्यः** । एष एवार्थो विस्पष्टीकृतः **कामसंभव** इति । संभवत्य् अस्माद् इति संभवः । कामः संभवो ऽस्येति ॥ ३.३२ ॥

The ‘*union*’—coming together at one place—‘*of the bride and
bridegroom, through love*’—through mutual longing.

In deprecation of this form of marriage it is added—‘*It has sexual
intercourse for its end*’—it serves the purpose of sexual intercourse
only. This is made clearer by the next clause—‘*it has its source* *in
lust*;’—‘*source*’ is that from which a thing springs; and it is from
lust that this union springs.—(32).

Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa raise the question as to the prescribed
offerings and wedding ceremonies being performed in the cage of the
Gāndharva, Rākṣasa and Paiśāca forms of marriage; and on the strength of
a text of Devala’s and another of Śaunaka (*Bahvṛca Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa*)
they declare that the offerings must be made, but that no Vaidika
mantras should be recited; this latter reservation being based on Manu’s
text (8.226). Medhātithi discusses this at great length under verse 34
below, from which it appears that the opinion on this subject has always
been divided. In support of the view that the subsequent rites are
essential, several texts are quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, pp.
861-862).

This verse is quoted in ‘*Vīramitrodaya*’ (Saṃskāra, p. 855), where the
‘*Anyonyasaṃyogaḥ*’ is explained as ‘mutual agreement’,—‘*Maithunyaḥ*,’
‘conducive to all acts accomplished by means of sexual intercourse’,—and
‘*Kāmasambhavaḥ*,’ as ‘originating from excessive lust’;—in *Hemādri*
(Dāna, p. 685);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 229), which
explains ‘*Maithunyaḥ*’ as ‘favourable to sexual intercourse.’
