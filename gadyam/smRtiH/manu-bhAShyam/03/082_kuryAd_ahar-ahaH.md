‘*Should offer*’—*i.e*., should perform.

‘*Daily*’—every day.

‘*Śrāddha*’—this term indicates the duty by its proper name. ‘*Śrāddha*’
is the name of the rite laid down as to be done in honour of one’s
ancestors, on the *Amāvasyā* day; and the whole process of that rite is
indicated by the name ‘Śrāddha.’

‘*With food*’—this is only a reiteration of ‘sesamum, barley, &c.’
(mentioned in 3.267); what is reiterated here being intended to be
described later on.

‘*With water*;’—‘*udaka*’ is *water*, and ‘*payaḥ*’ stands for
milk.—(82)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 145);—in *Saṃskāra-ratnamālā* (p.
922), which explains ‘*payaḥ*’ as *milk* and adds that this daily
*Śrāddha* need not be offered on a day on which a special *Śrāddha* is
offered;—in *Smrtisāroddhāra* (p. 283);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 208
and 1564);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (pp. 3 and 289);—in
*Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 353);—and in *Godādharapoddhati* (Kāla, p. 372).
