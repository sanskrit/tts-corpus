‘*Of these*’—days—‘*the first four*’— beginning from the day on which
the blood is first seen—‘*have* *been deprecated*,’—*i.e*., there should
be no intercourse on those days. On the first three days, even touching
is prohibited, the woman being impure on those days; on the fourth day,
when she has bathed,—though, according to the words of Vaśiṣṭha, she is
pure—there is to be no sexual intercourse; all the four days being
equally deprecated (for that purpose).

‘*The eleventh and the thirteenth*’ days also ‘have been
deprecated,’—*i.e*., on those days also intercourse has been forbidden.
The ‘eleventh’ and the ‘thirteenth’ days are those counted from the
first day of the flow; they do not stand for the two dates of the month;
because the genitive ending in ‘*tāsām*,’ ‘of these,’ signifies
*selection*; and, as the pronoun stands for ‘days,’ it must be the same
thing (day) that is *selected*; just as in the expression, ‘of cows, the
black one gives most milk.’

This prohibition of intercourse on the said six days is with a view to a
transcendental result.

‘*The remaining ten days have been recommended*,’—(of the sixteen days)
six days having been forbidden, the commendation of the remaining ten
days follows naturally; and it is this same natural conclusion that is
reiterated here.—(47)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 438);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 559), which adds that the ‘eleventh’ and
other numbers refer to the days of the ‘season;’ the eleventh day of the
‘season’ and so forth;—and in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 368) which, for
the first quarter, reads *tāsāmāpañcataḥ sarvā*, which means ‘all days
till the fifth’, coming to the same thing—that the first four days are
forbidden.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 104); which adds that the
‘eleventh’ and ‘thirteenth’ are meant to be the days of the ‘season’,
not of the *fortnight*;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 727), which adds that the
‘eleventh’ and ‘thirteenth’ are the days, not of the fortnight, but of
the ‘period’;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 682), which has the same note,
adding that such is the view of *Madanapārijāta*;—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 38), which says that of the sixteen nights, the first four
arc to be avoided;—and in *Ācāramayūkha* (p. 118).
