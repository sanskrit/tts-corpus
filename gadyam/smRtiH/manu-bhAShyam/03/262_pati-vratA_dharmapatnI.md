The modes of disposal mentioned above apply to the first and the last
balls; but the middlemost of the balls the lawful wife, desiring a son,
should eat; *i.e*., the wife who has not been married merely for the
sake of pleasure.

‘*Devoted to her husband*;’—one who makes it her vow that—‘I shall serve
my husband alone, even in my mind I shall never entertain even a thought
of faithlessness to him.’

‘*Intent upon*’—with full faith in—‘*the worshipping*’—the *śrāddha* and
other rites—‘*of the Pitṛs*.’ That is, she betakes herself with great
care to the performance of these.

‘*Should eat in the proper manner*—*i.e*., fully observing the rules
regarding the rinsing of the mouth and sipping of.water etc., etc.—(262)
