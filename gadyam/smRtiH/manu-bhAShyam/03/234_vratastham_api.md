At a śrāddha he should, with special care, feed the daughter’s son, even though he be still under vows (of studentship). He should offer the blanket as seat and scatter sesamum on the ground.—(234)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The propriety of feeding the daughter’s son is put forward here as a
substitute (for what has been enjoined in the preceding verses).

The ‘*Kutapa*’ is a piece of cloth of the shape of a blanket, and made
of the goat-wool; it is known among the Northerners as ‘*Kambala*’
(Blanket). This he should give as sent.

This does not apply to the case of the daughter’s son only, but to that
of all guests; that this is so, is shown by what is going to be said
regarding ‘three things being sacred at śrāddhas’ (next verse); which
shows that this is meant to apply to every kind of *śrāddha*.

‘*Scatter sesamum*’—on the ground.—(234)

‘*Kutapam*’—The commentators are agreed in explaining this as ‘blanket,’
The word also means ‘the hour of the day after half-past eleven, the
best suited for the offering of Śrāddhas.’ This meaning, however, is not
applicable to the present verse.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 475), which explains ‘*kutapa*’
as ‘blanket.’
