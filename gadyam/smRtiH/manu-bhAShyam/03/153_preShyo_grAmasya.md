‘*Servant*’—one who carries out orders: one who is sent by the
village-people hither and thither, on business.

Similarly, ‘*the servant of the king*,’ ‘*one who hew deformed nail*,’
‘*one who has black teeth*.’

‘*Opposer of his teacher*’— he who, in conversation and other things,
remains against and in opposition to his superior.

‘*One who has forsaken the Fire*’—*i.e*., out of the Three Fires and the
Domestic Fire, one who has given up even one,

‘*Usurer*’—one who, even though he has other menus of living available,
lives upon interest. Though ‘Usury’ has been defined as ‘the
accumulating *of grains* by interest,’ yet this definition can be
accepted as authoritative only within the limited scope of the subject
dealt with by the Smṛti in which it occurs; in fact, grammarians apply
the term ‘usurer’ to persons making a living by interest, in connection
with things other than grains also: and, in the matter of words and
their meanings, grammarians are more authoritative than others; because
they make these the subject of careful study.—(153)

It is interesting to note that this verse is omitted in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra p. 687) and *Madanapārijāta* (p. 560), though
both quote the preceding and the following verses. But the former
includes it in the explanations given later on (on p. 690), where the
term ‘*tyaktāgnim*’ is explained as ‘one who abandons the Śrauta and
Smārta fires without any reason for giving up the compulsory
duties,’—‘*vārdhuṣin*’ is explained as ‘one who borrows money at a cheap
rate and lends it at a higher rate of interest’

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 481);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Śrāddha p. 9a);—and in *Śrāddha-kriyākaumudī* (p. 40), which explains
‘*guroḥ pratiroddhā*’ as ‘one who behaves disagreeably to the Teacher,’
and ‘*vārdhuṣī*’ as ‘one who lives by lending money on interest’
