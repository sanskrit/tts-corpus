‘*Into the fire being thrown*’—by the sacrificer.

‘*Oblation*’—cooked rice, cakes and such other things, when thrown into
the fire, are called ‘oblation.’

‘*Reaches the sun*’—in an invisible form. The sun absorbs the essence of
all things; hence the essence of the oblation is described as reaching
the sun. This essence, evolving in the sun’s rays, becomes in time
developed into rain. From that proceeds ‘*food*’—in the shape of *Vrīhi*
and other grains. From that proceed ‘*creatures*,’—all living beings.

Thus, by throwing an oblation into the fire, the sacrificer continues to
help on the world-process.

What is stated here is only a commendatory supplement to the foregoing
injunction, and it is not meant to be literally true. If it were
literally true, then only one who desires rain would he entitled to the
performation of the act referred to; but no such thing has been asserted
anywhere. Nor is there any occasion for assuming such an assertion, when
it is possible to take the verse as supplementary to the principal
subject-matter of the context.—(76)
