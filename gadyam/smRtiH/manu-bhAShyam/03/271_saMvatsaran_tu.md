<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

As between direct and indirect connection, the former being more
authoritative, we construe ‘*gavyena’—‘cow’s*’—with ‘*payasā*,’ ‘milk
and not with ‘*māṃsa*,’ ‘meat,’ which forms the subject-matter of the
context.

Others, however, explain the particle ‘*ca*’ as having a cumulative
force, and then explain the passage to mean, ‘meat of the cow, and milk
or milk-rice.’

‘*Pāyasa*,’ ‘*milk-preparations*,’ stands for curds and such things, as
also rice cooked in milk.

‘*Vārdhrīṇasa*’—is *old goat*. The scriptures describe it as follows
s—‘Drinking with three, devoid of sense-virility and white,—such a goat
has been called *Vārdhriṇasa* by persons learned in sacrifices, in
connection with sacrificial rituals.’ That goat is called ‘drinking with
three’ who wets his tongue and two ears, while drinking water.

The Expiatory Rite that Śaṅkha has prescribed in connection with the
eating of beef, should be understood to apply to eating apart from the
‘*Madhuparka*’ offering and from the ‘*Aṣṭakā’ Śrāddhas*.—(271)

‘*Vārdhrīṇasa*’—‘An old goat, white and with long ears reaching the
water at the time of drinking’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘a black-necked, red-headed, white-winged crane’
(Nārāyaṇa).

Both these explanations are noted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 706),
where, however, the colour of the goat is mentioned as *red*, not
*white*. The definition of the goat quoted by Medhātithi is here
attributed to *Viṣṇudharmottara*, and that of the crane to the
‘*Nigama*’.

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 295), which adds the
definition of *Vārdhrīṇasa* as *white*;—and the first half in *Aparārka*
(p. 551), which explains ‘*pāyasa*’ as ‘rice cooked in milk’, and adds
that this milk should be such as is not forbidden.

It is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 536), which supplies the
description of the *Vārdhrīṇasa* as given in the *Nigama*—‘(a) The old
goat whose ears and mouth touch the water, who has lost his virility;
(b) the bird which has black neck, red head and white wings’.
