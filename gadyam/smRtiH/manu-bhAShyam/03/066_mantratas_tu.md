(Note: the following is an alternate translation by George Bühler)


But families that are rich in the knowledge of the Veda, though possessing little wealth, are numbered among the great, and acquire great fame.—(66)


Verses 57—66 are omitted by Medhātithi. [Query—are they interpolations?] “These are very probably a later addition. The corresponding section in the Mahābhārata, 13.46 stops right here also.”—Hopkins. They are all quoted in Vivādaratnākara and in Parāśaramādhava.
