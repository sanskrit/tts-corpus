While he is dealing with the subject of ‘supersession,’ the author
proceeds to state its prohibition by showing the evil that befalls all
persons connected with it.

He who is passed over, insulted, by the marriage is the ‘*superseded
elder brother*;’ and he who does the passing over of the elder brother
is ‘*the superseding younger brother*;’—that girl through whom the
superseding is done;—‘*all these go to hell*.’

The ‘*giver*’ and the officiating priest form the fifth of those that go
to hell. The ‘*giver*’ meant here must be that of the girl, her father
and other guardians; that such is the meaning is clear from the context.

The ‘*officiating priest*’ is one who performs the *Homa* in marriage,
or he who guides the ceremony. Or, it may mean ‘one who officiates as
priest at the performance of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other sacrifices by
the aforesaid four persons—the superseded elder brother, the superseding
younger brother, the girl that is married, and he who gives her away.’

For this reason, the elder brother should act in such a manner that he
does not form an obstacle in the marriage of his younger brother; and
the younger brother also should wait for twelve, eight or six years; and
the girl also should not allow herself to be given away to such a
person;

The compound ‘*dātṛyājakapañcamāḥ*’ is to be expounded as a *Bahuvrīhi*,
containing *Dvandva*: a ‘*Dātṛyājakau (Dvandva) pañcamau yeṣām*’
(Bahuvrīhi).—(172)

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 723) without comment;—also
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 760);—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p.
514) which adds the following notes—That girl also goes to hell, by
marrying whom the younger brother ‘supersedes’ the elder;
‘*dātṛyājakapañcamāḥ*’, *i.e*. (1) the bridegroom, (2) the bride, (3)
the superseded elder brother, (4) the giver away of the bride, (5) and
the priests officiating at the ceremony.

*Laghu-Śātātapa* (40).—\[Reproduces the words of Manu.\]

*Gobhila-Smṛti* (1.71).—‘The Superseder and the Superseded both
assuredly go to hell; if they have performed the expiatory rite, even so
they participate in the effects reduced only by a quarter.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.39).—\[Same as Manu, except that for ‘*Yāyā ca
parividyate*’ the reading is *Yā chainam parivindati*.’

*Mahābhārata* (12.165-68).—(The first line is the same as Manu.)—‘He who
marries illegally—all these are outcasts.’

172	The elder brother who marries after the younger, the younger brother who marries before the elder, the female with whom such a marriage is contracted, he who gives her away, and the sacrificing priest, as the fifth, all fall into hell.
