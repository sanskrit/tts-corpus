The bride’s relations are not only to receive presents for her from the
bridegroom; they themselves shall make presents to her.

‘*Fathers*’—through association, the term ‘father’ here includes the
grandfather, uncle, etc., also; hence the plural number; or, the plural
number may be explained as referring to several individual brides.

Similarly, ‘*husbands*’ may stand for father-in-law, &c.; or, it may
refer to several individual girls.

‘*Brothers-in-law*’—the husband’s brothers.

‘*Shall be honoured*’—during rejoicings in connection with the birth of
sons, &c., they should be invited, welcomed and received with honour and
feasting.

‘*Shall be adorned*’—should be decked with clothes, ornaments, unguents,
and so forth.

The effect of all this is next indicated—‘*welfare* what is desirable,
*i.e*., being endowed with children, wealth, &c., good health, freedom
from troubles, and so forth: Those who are desirous of all this—*i.e*.,
of obtaining all this (should do what is said above).

The injunction contained in this verse has been set forth for the
purpose of indicating this reward.—(55)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 506), in support of
the view that the wife, whether young or old—should always be respected,
‘worshipped’; but it adds that this does not apply to the *unchaste*
wife, for whom one should provide just enough to keep her body and soul
together.
