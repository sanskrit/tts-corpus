<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Soup, butter, curds, sugar, and such other rich food, he himself should
not eat, so long as he does not offer it to the guest that may have
arrived. As for gruel and such other bitter medicinal drinks, he shall
not offer these to him, if he does not desire it; there is no harm in
the man taking these without offering them to the guest. All that this
means is that he should uot himself eat rich food and offer to the guest
poor fare.

‘*Conducive to wealth*’— procures, brings, wealth. Similarly,
‘*conducive to fame*,’ and so forth.

All this is purely laudatory; because the honouring of guests is a
compulsory duty, if he happen to be there, and also because what is here
said is clearly supplementary to the foregoing injunction (of
guest-honouring). And so long us a passage can be taken as purely
laudatory, there is no justification for taking it as putting forward
another incentive.—(106)

the case of elders.’

106	Let him not eat any (dainty) food which he does not offer to his guest; the hospitable reception of guests procures wealth, fame, long life, and heavenly bliss.
