From the sages were born the Pitṛs, Gods and Men; and from the gods the entire world, moveable and immoveable, in due order.—(201)

न पित्र्यं कर्म दैवात् कर्मणो न्यूनं द्रष्टव्यम् । अपि तु तद् एव प्रधानतमम् । यतो जन्मज्येष्ठाः पितरो देवानाम् । तथा हि **ऋषिभ्यः** पितर उत्पन्नाः **पितृभ्यो** देवा इत्य् एष सृष्टिक्रमः । **देवेभ्यो** ऽन्यत् **सर्वं जगत् चरं** जङ्गमं **स्थाणु** स्थावरम् **अनुपूर्वशः**, प्रथमे ऽध्याये उक्तः क्रमः । अतिक्रान्तो ऽर्थवादसंपातः ॥ ३.१९१ ॥

The rite in honour of the Pitṛs should not be looked upon as inferior to
that in honour of the gods; in fact, the former is the more important of
the two; because by birth, the Pitṛs are elder than the gods. For, the
order of creation is that the Pitṛs were born from the sages, and the
gods were born from the Pitṛs, and from the gods, the whole of the rest
of the world—‘*moveable*’—animate—as well as ‘*immoveable*’—inanimate.

‘*In* *due order*’—the order having been already described under
Discourse I.

The entire series of purely laudatory descriptions has now come to an
end.—(201)

201	From the sages sprang the manes, from the manes the gods and the Danavas, but from the gods the whole world, both the movable and the immovable in due order.
