**होमे** अग्निहोत्रादौ शान्त्यादिहोमे वा । **प्रदाने** गोहिरण्यादिद्रव्यविषये । अभ्युदयार्थे । **भोज्ये** ब्राह्मणा यत्र धर्माय भोज्यन्ते । **दैवे हविषि** दर्शपौर्णमासादौ । **पित्र्ये** श्राद्धे । **यद् अभिवीक्ष्यते** क्रियमाणं[^४१२] कर्म । **तद् गच्छत्य् अयथातथम्** । यदर्थं क्रियते तद्विपरीतं भावयति । यद्य् अपि श्राद्धप्रकरणं तथापि वाक्याद् अन्यत्रापि होमादाव् अयं प्रतिषेधः ॥ ३.२३० ॥

‘*At the offering into Fire*’—such as the *Agnihotra*, or the
propitiatory offerings.

‘*At gifts*’—of such valuable things as the cow, gold and so forth—made
for the purpose of attaining prosperity.

‘*Feeding*’—where Brāhmaṇas are fed for a religious purpose.

‘*Rite in honour of the gods*’—such the as offering at the
*Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* and other sacrifices.

‘*Rite in honour of the Pitṛs*’—*i.e.*, *Śrāddha*.

‘*Goes wrong*,’—that is, it brings about results contrary to what it was
intended for.

Though *Śrāddha* forms the subject-matter of the present context, yet,
through syntactical connection, the present prohibition applies to other
acts also, in the shape of the *offering into fire* and so forth.—(240)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 472);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī*,
which explains ‘*ayathāyatham*’ as ‘nullified’;—also in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 521), which explains the same word as
‘leading to results contrary to those expected’;—and in *Hemādri* (Dāna,
p. 108, and Śrāddha, p. 516).

240	What (any of) these sees at a burnt-oblation, at a (solemn) gift, at a dinner (given to Brahmanas), or at any rite in honour of the gods and manes, that produces not the intended result.
