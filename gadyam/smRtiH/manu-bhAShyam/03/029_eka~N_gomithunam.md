“*Pair*;”—*i.e*., the cow (female) and the bull (male).—‘*one or
two*,’—‘*after taking*’—receiving—‘*from the bridegroom*, ’—*when the
maiden is given away*’—this is the ‘*Ārṣa*’ form.

‘*In obedience to law*;’—*i.e*., with the idea that such receiving is
sanctioned by law, and hot with the idea of receiving it in exchange for
(price for) the girl. The sense is that what is received cannot be
regarded as the *price*; as there is no possibility of any higher or
lower demand being made (as there would be if it were a question of
*price*).—(29)

Burnell is not right in remarking that ‘this is the most common form
now.’ Among the better classes of the Brāhmaṇas the ‘Brāhma’ still
continues to be the most common form; and among others, the form most
common now is the Āsura.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 849), where
‘*dharmataḥ*’ is explained as meaning ‘according to family-custom’; or
‘in obedience to the law governing the Ārṣa marriage, not by way of a
*price* for the girl.’

It is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 155) as showing that it is not
necessary that the number of ‘cows given should be always ‘two’ as
mentioned in other *Smṛtis*;—it adds that if the Father of the Bride
accept this ‘pair of cow and bull’ it becomes a ‘selling’ of the
girl;—in *Hemādri* (Dana, p. 684);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p.
62a);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 228), which explains
‘*Gomithunam*’ as ‘a milch cow and a bull.’
