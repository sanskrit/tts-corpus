This is a commendatory supplement to the foregoing Injunction,

‘*Steaming*’—*i.e*., hot.—(237)
</details>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 223), which adds that the
control of speech itself being sufficient to the men describing the good
qualities of the food, what is meant by the last clause ‘as long as the
qualities of the food are not described’ is that these qualities should
not be indicated even by gesticulation;—and it further points out that
the rule regarding the food being ‘steaming’ is not meant to apply to
such food as *parched rice* and others of the kind.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 497);—and in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 170).
