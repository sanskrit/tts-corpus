‘*Wound up*’—with turban and such other things. The Northerners cover
their heads with cloth.

Some people explain that this refers also to persons who cover their
heads with their hairs Arranged in the form of a top-knot. Rut what they
say is not reasonable; as, in this case, it is the *hair* that is ‘wound
up,’ not the *head*; and the *hairs* do not form the *head*; in fact,
they are *on the head*. The prohibition does not apply to threads and
such things; as such things are not regarded as ‘covering’ the head.

What is meant by indicating the facing of the south as defective is
that, when there is want of space, eating with face towards all
directions *except the south* is permissible. If this were not meant,
where would there be any possibility of anyone eating with face to the
south, when it has been distinctly enjoined that one should eat facing
the north?

‘*Shoes*’—foot-guards made of leather. Some people explain this as
sandals of leather.

‘*The demons eat*,’—and not the Pitṛs.

This is deprecatory of the conditions described.—(238)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 169);—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 1021), which explains ‘*veṣṭitam*’ as wrapped up by turban
etc.;—the specific prohibition of facing the south implies that when
there is scarcity of room one may eat facing any other quarter but the
south,—‘*upānahau*’ are foot-covers of leather (shoes).

“The same verse in the Mahābhārata ends: *Sarvam vidyāt tadāsuram*
(13.90.19), ‘belonging to the Asuras’.”—Hopkins.

*Viṣṇu* (81.12-13).—‘Not people with covered heads; nor those with shoes
on.’

*Mahābhārata* (13.237, 19).—\[Reproduces Manu, but reading ‘*sarvam
vidyāt tadāsuram*’ for ‘*tadvai rakṣāṃsi bhuñjaṭe*.’\]
