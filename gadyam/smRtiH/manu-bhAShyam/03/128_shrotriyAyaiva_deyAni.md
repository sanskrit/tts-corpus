Food offered to the gods and that offered in the Pitṛs are to be given to the most deserving; Brāhmaṇa learned in the Vedas. What is given to him is conducive to great results.—(128)

‘*Learned in the Veda*’—he who recites the entire Vedic text, Mantras as
well as Brāhmaṇas: to him;—‘the food offered to the gods’—*i*.*e*.,
those articles of food that are offered, in connection with *Śrāddhas to
the* *Visve-devas*:—‘*should be given*;’—as also ‘*the food offered*
*to* *the Pitṛs*,’

‘*Most deserving*;’—‘desert (deserve?)’ here stands for *respectability*
and *ability*. It is a person born of a noble family that is respected;
and a person born of a noble family is generally equipped with learning
and character.

‘*What is given to him*,’—even things other than the *Śrāddha-*
offerings,—‘*is conducive to great results*.’ The meaning is that—‘gift
made to the unlearned is fruitless; that made to a person learned in the
Veda, but devoid of nobility and other good qualities, is conducive to
some slight results; and that to the most deserving is conducive to
great results.’—(128)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 350) as laying down
that the learned man alone is entitled to be fed at religious rites;—and
again on page 679 to the same effect;—in *Aparārka* (p. 437);—also in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 377);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 34); and. in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 6b).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.9).—‘Offerings made to Gods and Pitṛs should be presented
to the Vedic scholars; that which is presented to one ignorant of the
Veda reaches neither the Pitṛs nor the Gods.’

*Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (4.2).—(See under 125.)

*Gautama* (15.9).—‘Vedic scholars, endowed with eloquence, beauty, age
and character.’

*Prajāpati-Smṛti* (70, 71, 74).—‘Those engaged in Vedic rites, calm,
sinless, maintainers of Fire, devoted to their duties, austerities,
conversant with the meaning of the Veda, born in noble families, devoted
to parents, maintaining themselves by means of livelihood recommended
for Brāhmaṇas, teachers knowing Brahman,—such are the Brāhmaṇas that are
helpful in the success of Śrāddhas.

*Smṛtyantara* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 350).—‘If food is offered to a
Brāhmaṇa who is devoid of cleanliness, fallen from his vows, and
ignorant of the Veda, it weeps and says —*what sin have I committed*!’

*Mahābhārata-Āśvamedhika* (Do.).—‘Food should be offered to one who
arrives at the right time and place, suffering from hunger, thirst and
fatigue.’

128	Oblations to the gods and manes must be presented by the givers to a Srotriya alone; what is given to such a most worthy Brahmana yields great reward.
