In certain Vedic texts, it is these sacrifices that have been enjoined
under these names; hence the present verse mentions these names, with a
view to show that the injunction of these is based upon the Veda itself.

What is meant also is that the rites that have been mentioned in the
Veda by the names. ‘*Ahuta*’ and the rest, are also included here,
though not mentioned by the same names. This is another purpose that the
author had in view in mentioning these other names; just like the names
‘*brahmayajña*,’ ‘*śrāddha*,’ ‘*udvāha*,’ ‘*parikriyā*,’ and so
forth.—(73)

Two of these technical terms occur in the beginning of Baudhāyana’s
*Gṛhyasūtra*, and four in Pāraskara’s *Gṛhyasūtra* 1.4.1, as well as in
Śāṅkhāyana’s 1.5.1.

This verse is quoted, without comment, in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p.
392);—and in *Aparārka* (p. 142), which adds that these are the names
for the ‘five sacrifices.’
