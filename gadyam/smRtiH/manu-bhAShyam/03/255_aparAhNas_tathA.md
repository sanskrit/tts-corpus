The *Śrāddha* should be performed in the afternoon.

‘*These are the essentials* *of* *Śrāddha rites*,’—*i.e*., attempt
should be made to bring about all these things.

Though the present text mentions the ‘afternoon’ without reference to
any particular *Śrāddha*, yet it is not to be observed in connection
with *all* Śrāddhas: for we have another Smṛti-text to the effect
that—‘rites in honour of the gods shall he performed in the forenoon;
that in honour of the Pitṛs in the afternoon; the Śrāddha offered to a
single person shall be performed at mid-day, while that in connection
with auspicious rites shall be performed in the morning.’

‘*Dwelling*’—house; the ‘*setting* *up*’ ‘of this consists in the
white-washing of the walls with lime etc., the smearing of the floor
with cowdung; having its slope to wards the south.

‘*Liberality*’—charity; *i.e*., unstinted giving away of food and
vegetables.

‘*Cleaning*’—washing; *i.e*., a particular maimer of preparing the food.

Others have explained this verse to mean that these things constitute
the ‘excellence’—the superiority—of the rites,—and not that they shall
not be performed without these.—(255)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 474), which explains ‘*Sṛṣṭi*’ as
connoting ‘plenty’, and ‘*Mṛṣṭi*’ as connoting ‘deliciousness’;—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 111 and 72), which adds the following
notes:—‘*V* *āstu*’, the house built for the Śrāddha-performance,—its
‘*Sampādana*’ means ‘building or acquiring by purchase, making it slope
towards the South, levelling, washing and besmearing with
cow-dung’—‘*Sṛṣṭi*’ means ‘giving away’ *i.e*., freely giving away
vegetables and other things,—‘*Mṛṣṭi*’, cleanliness or
sweetness,—‘*agryāḥ*’, those equipped with *Vedic* learning,—these are
‘*Śrāddhasampadaḥ*’ *i.e*., excellences of things used at the Śrāddha;
this implies that all these should be got together.

*Prajāpati* (70.71).—‘The following Brāhmaṇas are conducive to the
accomplishment of the Śrāddha:—Those that are devoted to the Vedic
duties, those that are of calm disposition, sinless, devoted to the
fires, firm in their duties, firm in their austerities, conversant with
the meaning of the Veda, born of noble families, devoted to their
parents, living by the methods prescribed for Brāhmaṇas, teachers, those
conversant with Brahman.’

*Yama-Hārīta-Śātātapa* (quoted in Caturvargacintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p.
1172).—\[Reproduce Manu.\]

255	The afternoon, Kusa grass, the due preparation of the dwelling, sesamum grains, liberality, the careful preparation of the food, and (the company of) distinguished Brahmanas are true riches at all funeral sacrifices.
