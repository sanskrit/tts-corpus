यद्य् अपि श्राद्धभुजो दोषग्रहणं तथापि कर्तुर् अयम् उपदेशः । तेन तथा कर्तव्यं यथा न प्रयच्छति । ऋत्विङ्नियमवत् । **वृषलः** शूद्रः । **अवाक्शिरा** ऊर्ध्वपादः । प्रकृत एव सपिण्डीकरणं मा विज्ञायीति श्राद्धग्रहणम् ॥ ३.२३९ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Though the text mentions the evil accruing to the diner, yet the advice
intended is conveyed to the performer of the *śrāddha*; the sense being
that ‘he should manage it so that the diner does not offer the leavings
to a *Śūdra*.’ This form of the rule is analogous to that pertaining to
the Priests (where also what is meant is that the master of the
sacrifice so arranges things that the Priests do not commit any breaches
of law).

‘*Vṛṣala*’—Śūdra.

‘*Head-long*’—With the feet upwards.

The term ‘*śrāddha*’ has been repeated here for the purpose of guarding
against the idea that what is here stated pertains to the ‘Amalgamating
Rite’ only.—(249)
