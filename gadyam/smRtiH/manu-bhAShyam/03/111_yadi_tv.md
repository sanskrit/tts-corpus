If a Kṣatriya should happen to come to one’s house in the character of a guest, one may feed him also, after the Brāhmaṇas have eaten.—(111)

The ‘character’ of the guest consists of—(*a*) having run short of food
during the journey, (*b*) bring in a strange village and (*c*) arriving
at the time of eating. In this character, if a *Kṣatriya* happen to come
to one’s house, then the householder shall feed him also.

By specifically mentioning ‘feeding,’ the other factors of the
‘honouring’ of guests become precluded; but the addressing of agreeable
and wholesome words has been generally enjoined as to be addressed
equally to everyone coming to one’s house. The proper time for feeding
him is this:—he should be fed after the Brāhmaṇas—guests as well as such
non-guests as are entitled to eat first—have eaten.

‘*May*’—this shows the absence of compulsion; the sense being that what
is here laid down is voluntary, not obligatory. And since the reward has
not been mentioned, it follows that Heaven is the reward, as it is in
the case of all those acts whose rewards are not specifically mentioned.
Or, we might connect with this the phrase ‘conducive to wealth, fame,
etc.’ (of verse 106).—(111)

‘*Kāmam*’—May; *i.e*., ‘it is not incumbent upon him; it is left to his
choice’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa);—‘as much as the person wishes’
(Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Ācāra, p. 354) as laying
down what should be done if a *Kṣatriya* comes to one’s house as a
guest;—in *Aparārka* (p. 152) as laying down that the Householder may,
if he likes, entertain guests other than the Brāhmaṇas;—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 440), which notes that this lays down the rule that to the
*Śūdra* thus arrived one should offer the food left in the dishes.
