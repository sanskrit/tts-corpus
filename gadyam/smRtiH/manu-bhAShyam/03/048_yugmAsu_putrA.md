Among the said ten days, the ‘even days’ are the sixth, the eighth, the
tenth, the twelfth, the fourteenth and the sixteenth; and when one has
intercourse with one’s wife on these days, sons are born to him.

‘*One who desires a son should have recourse to one’s wife on the even
days of her season*;’—*i.e*., because ‘*female ones*’—*i.e*., daughters
are conceived—‘on the uneven days,’—‘*therefore*’ for the bringing about
of the birth of sons, ‘*one should have recourse* to’—have sexual
intercourse with—‘*one’s wife, on the even days of her season?*’

This is a mere reiteration; and it is also a restrictive rule, the
meaning being that ‘one, for whom no sons have been born, should not
have intercourse with one’s wife on the uneven days.’—(48)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 438), where
‘*yugmāsu*’ is explained as ‘even nights’, and ‘*samvishet*’ as ‘should
approach’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 559), which explains
‘*ayugmāsu*’ as ‘odd nights’, and ‘*samvishet*’ as ‘should
approach;—also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p. 153) in support of the
view that ‘one who desires a son should approach his wife on the even
nights of the period, and he who desires a daughter, on the odd nights’;
and adds that though the text speaks simply of ‘nights’, yet the act
should be done *after midnight*; and also that the special mention of
the ‘night’ clearly indicates that intercourse during the day is
forbidden.

*Smṛtitattva* quotes this verse as describing the results accruing from
approaching one’s wife on certain days.

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 103);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 722);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 16);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 37);—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 680);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 24
*b*).
