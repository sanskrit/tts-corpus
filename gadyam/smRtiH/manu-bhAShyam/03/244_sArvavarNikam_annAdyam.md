The term ‘*varṇa*’ should be taken as standing for *kind*. Having
‘*mixed up*’— brought together—the food along with all the various kinds
of seasonings—‘*having wetted it with water*’—‘*he should throw it
before the Brāhmaṇas who have eaten*’—*i.e*., become fully satisfied;
after they have pronounced the words, ‘We are fully satisfied;’
‘*scattering it*’—*i.e*., it should not be thrown at one place, but
broken up and scattered;—‘*on the ground*’—not in any vessel; on the
ground also, not on the bare ground, but on *Kuśa-grass*, as it is going
to be laid down in the next verse. Śaṅkha says that the scattering
should be done ‘either once or thrice.’—(244)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 750), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Sārvavarṇikam*’ means ‘that food which contains
the particular vegetable called *Sarvavarṇā*;—and in *Aparārka* (p.
504), which explains that what is meant by ‘*sannīya*’ is that the food
should be collected in one vessel.
