<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The ‘*good*’ results are mentioned only by way of an example; or as
laying down the functions of the mind and speech.

Actions proceed from mind, speech and body. The term ‘*Karma*,’
‘*action*,’ here does not stand only for that movement of the body which
is involved in the performance of sacrifices; it stands for all kinds of
action, even those of the nature of contemplation, meditation, speaking
and the like.

The term ‘*phala*,’ ‘*result*,’ is to be construed with each of the two
terms of the compound (‘*śubha*’ and ‘*aśubha*’); so that what the
compound means is ‘conducive to good results’ and ‘conducive to bad
results.’

This should not be understood to mean that good and bad results are
obtained only from the performance of such actions as are accomplished
by bodily operations, in fact the same thing happens in the case of
actions springing from mind and speech also; since results have been
described as proceeding from all the three kinds of actions.—(3)

*Hārīta* (Aparārka, p. 998).—‘Whatever act, good or bad, a man does, in
whatever circumstances, of that he obtains the reward under the same
circumstances. In the body he suffers the consequences of his bodily
acts; in speech, those of his verbal acts; and in his mind, those of his
mental acts.’
