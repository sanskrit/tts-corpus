<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Accepting from unworthy people of what has not been given, and what is
itself an impure thing.

^(‘)*Wives of others*’—includes unmarried maidens also.

As against these there are—accepting proper gifts in the proper manner,
protecting others and controlling of the organs.

Thus has Action proceeding from Mind, Speech and Body, been described as
being of^(‘)ten kinds’; and according as each of these is either ‘good’
or ‘bad,’ we have *twenty* kinds.—(7)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 692); in *Aparārka* (p.
998), which adds that the ten kinds of sinful acts, proceeding from the
mind, speech and body, when committed intentionally and repeatedly,
should be understood to be what leads to the map being born in such
bodies as those of the *Cāṇḍāla* and the like; but of, the same kinds of
acts, when done unintentionally, the results are different;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 41a);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 632);—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 88).
