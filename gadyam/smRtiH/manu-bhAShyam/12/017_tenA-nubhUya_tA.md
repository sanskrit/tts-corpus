‘*Yama*’ is the name of a particular deity, who inflicts punishments
upon sinners,—which are spoken of here as ‘*torments*.’

After the man has ‘*experienced*’ these torments, through the said body
of five constituent material substances,—those bodies become dissolved
into the said subtle particles of those substances.—(17)

“Kullūka and Nandana assume that the subject of both clauses is
‘*duṣkṛtino jīvāḥ*”.—Buhler.

“According to Nandana the meaning of the verse is—‘The individual souls,
having suffered by means of that body the torments of Yama, are
dissolved, on the termination of those sufferings in those very five
elements according to the proportion of their works’.”—Buhler.
