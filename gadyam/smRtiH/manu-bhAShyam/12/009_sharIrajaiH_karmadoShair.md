<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

What the verse describes is what happens in a large number of cases; the
sense being that in most cases whenever men are reborn in the species
mentioned, it is due to causes herein specified. Bat it is not always
so; as it is going to be asserted later on (55 *et. seq*.) that those
who commit the ‘heinous offences’ are born among the lower animals and
so forth.

‘*Birds*’ and ‘*beasts*’ stand here for all kinds of lower animals.

What the verse is really meant to indicate is that, among sins due to
Mind, Speech and Body, the succeeding ones are graver than the preceding
ones.—(9)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 692);—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
480);—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.68), in support of the view that mental acts
lead to the soul being born in particular kinds of bodies;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 6).

009	In consequence of (many) sinful acts committed with his body, a man becomes (in the next birth) something inanimate, in consequence (of sins) committed by speech, a bird, or a beast, and in consequence of mental (sins he is re-born in) a low caste.
