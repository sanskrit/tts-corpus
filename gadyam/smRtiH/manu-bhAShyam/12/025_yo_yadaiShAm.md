Whichsoever of these qualities wholly predominates in a body, it makes the owner of that body abound in that quality.—(25)

यद्य् अपि सर्वं त्रिगुणं तथापि **यो यदा गुणः साकल्येन** कार्त्स्न्येन **अतिरिच्यते** आधिक्यं प्राप्नोति पूर्वकर्मातिशयवशात्, **स तदा** पुरुषस्य गुणान्तरम् अभिभवति । अतः शरीरी तद्गुणप्रायो भवति । तदीयम् एव धर्मम् आदर्शयति, गुणान्तरं जहातीव ॥ १२.२५ ॥

Though every entity is possessed of the three qualities, yet if any one
of these should happen to ‘*wholly*’—entirely—‘*predominate*’—exceed
others—in a body, on account of the influence of his past deeds, that
quality suppresses every other quality of that person; hence, the owner
of that body comes to ‘*abound in that quality*’; that is, in his
character, he shows signs of that quality and abandons in the other
qualities.—(25)

025	When one of these qualities wholly predominates in a body, then it makes the embodied (soul) eminently distinguished for that quality.
