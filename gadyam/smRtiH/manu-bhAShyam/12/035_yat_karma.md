‘*Having done*, or *doing, or going to do*.’—This indicates what has
been spoken of as the ‘*three times*’; the said feeling may appear in
some cases, at all the three points of time, while in others only at one
or other of them; and it appears in the form of regret—‘Why did I do
such an act? How can I appear before gentlemen?’—(35)
