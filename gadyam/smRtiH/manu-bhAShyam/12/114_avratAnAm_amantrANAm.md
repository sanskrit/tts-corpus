Even if thousands of Brāhmaṇas come together,—who have not fulfilled their duties, who are ignorant of the sacred texts, who subsist merely by the name of their caste,—the character of the ‘Assembly’ cannot belong to them.—(114)

‘*Who have not fulfilled their duties*’;—what has been already asserted
before is stated here in the negative form.

When persons fulfilling their duties and learned in the Veda lay down a
certain law, no doubts should be entertained regarding it,—either by
learned or by ignorant men. Nor should any optional alternatives be
admitted in such cases.—(114)

*Baudhāyana* (1.1.16).—‘Many thousands cannot form an Assembly, if they
have not fulfilled their sacred duties, are unacquainted with the Veda,
and subsist only by the name of their caste.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.5).—(Same as above.)

*Parāśara* (8.12).—(Same as Manu.)

114	Even if thousands of Brahmanas, who have not fulfilled their sacred duties, are unacquainted with the Veda, and subsist only by the name of their caste, meet, they cannot (form) an assembly (for settling the sacred law).
