Pleasure is the distinguishing feature of ‘Tamas,’ ‘Wealth’ is described to be that of ‘Rajas,’ and ‘Spiritual Merit’ is the distinguishing feature of ‘Sattva,’—each succeeding one of these being superior to the preceding.—(38)

“There is happiness in pleasure also; so what has been described as the
characteristic of ‘Sattva’ (under Verso 27, above)—‘when one feels
bliss, etc., etc.,’ would apply to this also; how then can it be the
distinguishing feature of ‘Tamas,’ which is of the nature of
‘stupefaction,’ while in Pleasure, there is keen consciousness, which
also is a characteristic of ‘Sattva,’ since it has been declared above
that ‘Sattva is knowledge, etc.’? (26).”

The answer to the above is as follows:—What is set forth in the present
verse is not the condition of the *Agent* or of the *object* of
experience; what is meant is an excessive longing for a certain end; and
certainly at the time of the *longing*, there is no happiness, since the
object longed for is not there.

Thus then, whenever a man has an excessive craving for Pleasure, he
becomes deprived of the power to discriminate between right and wrong,
and is really in a state of stupefaction. It is this sort of craving
that is meant by the term ‘pleasure,’—and such desire as for the company
*of* one’s wife during her ‘season.’—(38)
