‘*Of three kinds*’—arising from speech, mind and body.

‘*Thrice*’—according to the three qualities of ‘*Sattva*’ and the rest.

‘*Threefold*’—as divided into ‘good,’ ‘bad,’ and ‘middling.’

Those other ‘states’ that may not have been mentioned here are to be
understood as resembling, and hence included among, those already
mentioned.

This verse sums up the section on the *Three Qualities*; and the next is
indicative of what is to follow.—(51)
