This verse provides the definition of the ‘cultured’ man.

“The definition of the *cultured* man has already been [provided under
2.13].”

But that verse has been suspected of having a totally different meaning;
hence it cannot be regarded as providing the required definition. There
is another statement—that man is *cultured* who is not affected by
desires.’ But in this, ‘learning’ is not made a necessary condition.
\[Hence this also cannot be accepted as the requisite definition.\]

When the Veda has been completely learnt and its meaning has been
thoroughly grasped,—‘*along with its supplements*’—as described by the
revered Vyāsa,—‘The Veda should be *supplemented* by *Itihāsas* and
*Purāṇas*’;—by this the *Smṛtis* also became included.

The mention of ‘*Brāhmaṇas*’ is purely reiterative; since none other
than the Brāhmaṇa is entitled to expound *Dharma*.

‘*Guided directly by the revealed texts*’—The revealed texts are their
‘*direct guide*’;—*i.e*., those for whom the Veda constitutes Perception
and all other means of knowledge. What is meant is that they look upon
the Veda as free from all defects, to the same extent that direct
Perception is regarded as entirely trustworthy,—they do not rely upon
those means of cognition that are based entirely on reasonings; they
regard the Veda itself as embodying ‘reasoning’ also, and do not seek to
establish the authority of the Veda by means of arguments.

Or, the phrase may mean that ‘they rely upon such Vedic texts as are
directly found’;—*i.e*., they look upon these directly perceptible texts
as the sole means of ascertaining what is *Dharma* (right) and what is
*Adharma* (wrong).—(109)

‘*Śrutipratyakṣahetavaḥ*’—‘Those who have learnt the Vedic text, also
facts of perception and reasonings’, *or* ‘those for whom the
perceptible Vedic texts are the sole means of discriminating virtue and
vice’ (Medhātithi);—‘who are the cause of the teaching of the subjects
perceptible in the Veda’ (Govindarāja),—‘who are the causes of making
the revealed texts perceptible by reciting them’ (Kullūka);—‘those for
whose knowledge and exposition of the Law, the causes consist of Hearing
and Perception by the senses’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra p. 6) as defining the
‘*Śiṣṭa*.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.6-7).—‘He whose heart is free from desire is called
*śiṣṭa*. Acts sanctioned by the sacred law are those for which no
worldly cause is perceptible.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (6.43).—‘Those Brāhmaṇas in whose families the study of the
Veda and the subsidiary sciences is hereditary, and who are able to
adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts, must be
known to be *śiṣṭa*, cultured.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.1.5-6).—‘*Śiṣṭa*, cultured, forsooth, are those who are
free from envy, free from pride, contented with a store of grain
sufficient for ten days, free from covetousness, and free from
hypocrisy, arrogance, greed, perplexity and anger. Those are called
*cultured* who, in accordance with the sacred Law, have studied the Veda
together with its subsidiaries, know how to draw inferences from it, and
are able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed
texts.’

*Āpastamba* (2.29.14-15).—‘The indications for doubtful cases are—“He
shall regulate his course of action according to the conduct which is
unanimously recognised in all countries by men of the three twice-born
castes, who have been properly obedient to their teachers, who are aged,
of subdued senses, free from avarice and hypocrisy.” Acting thus he will
gain both worlds. Some people say that the remaining duties must be
learnt from women and from men of all castes.’

109	Those Brahmanas must be considered as Sishtas who, in accordance with the sacred law, have studied the Veda together with its appendages, and are able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts.
