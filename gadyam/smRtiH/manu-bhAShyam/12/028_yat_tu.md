‘*Mixed with pain*’—interspersed with pain; and not pure, hence
described as ‘*bringing unhappiness*,’—being mixed up with pain, it does
not make men happy.

‘*Apratīpam*’—imperceptible, though real.

This is the form of ‘*Rajas*’—‘*constantly attracting* men towards
sensual objects, arousing in their mind a longing for these.—(28)
