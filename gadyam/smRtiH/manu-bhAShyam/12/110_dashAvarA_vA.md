<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

That in which there are at least ten men;—if more cannot be brought
together, there should be at least ten.

If this be not possible, there should be *at least three*.

‘*Firm in their duty*.’—This is a reference to what has been [said under
2.13].

What is meant to be emphasised here is not the *number*, but the
*qualification*; as in clear from what is going to be said in Verse 113
below, regarding ‘even a single Brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda, etc.,
etc.,’ and the larger numbers are mentioned only in view of the fact
that it may be difficult to find any single person possessed with all
the requisite qualifications.

The qualifications for membership of the Assembly are next
enumerated.—(110)
