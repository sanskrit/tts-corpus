‘*Full of bliss*’—a feeling of happiness.

‘*Śuddhābham*’—that which *appears pure*, not tainted by ‘Rajas’ and
‘Tamas,’ and hence free from passions, vanity, love, hatred,
covetousness, delusion, fear, grief and jealousy. This condition is one
that should be realised by the man himself, at some time or the
other.—(27)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 999), which has the following
notes:—‘*Prīti*’ is *sukha*, happiness; what brings about this happiness
is ‘*prītisaṃyuktam*’;—*śuddhābham*, the source of faultless
knowledge,—this is ‘*Sattva*.’
