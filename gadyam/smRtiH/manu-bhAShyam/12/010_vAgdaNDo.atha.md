Control over Speech, control over the Mind and control over the Body,—the man in whose heart these are firmly fixed is called ‘the man of triple control.’—(10)

दमनं **दण्डः** । **वाचो दण्डः** पारुष्याप्रवृत्तिः । एवम् उत्तरयोर् अपि । **यस्यैते** दण्डा **बुद्धौ निहिता** "नैतन् मया कर्तव्यम्" इति यो न स्खलति **स त्रिदण्डीत्य् उच्यते** । न त्व् अनार्यो गुरुकाष्ठदण्डं धारयति ॥ १२.१० ॥

‘*Control*’—keeping in check; and ‘*control of speech*’ means *desisting
from abusing others*; and so with the other two.

‘*The man in whose heart these three are firmly fixed*’;—he who has made
up his mind that he would never commit such an act, and who never fails
in this resolve:—such a man is called ‘*the man of triple control*’; and
not one who carries heavy wooden *sticks* (*daṇḍas*).—(10)
