<u>परस्य</u> मनस्तापो येन जन्यते कर्मणा ततो **मानसं** दुःखम् आप्नोतीति केचित् ।

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Some people explain this to mean that when by his act, a man causes
mental pain to others, he himself experiences, in return, mental pain.

Our opinion is that one experiences mental suffering as the result of
*all the three kinds* of ‘mental acts.’

Similarly in the case of the other two (Verbal and Bodily acts)
also.—(8)
