What is mixed with stupefaction, undiscernible, of the nature of sensual objects, incapable of being reasoned about and uncognisable,—one should recognise as ‘Tamas.’—(29)

‘*Stupefaction*’— absent-mindedness, incapability to discriminate
between right and wrong.

‘*Of the nature of sensual objects*’—that which has the character of
sensual objects.

“The *guṇa of Tamas* is not an *object*, being something *internal*;
how, then, can it have the character of the *object*?

This is so described, on account of Delusion being the cause of
attachment to objects. That which creates a longing for a thing is said
to be of the nature of that thing.

‘*Incapable of being reasoned about*’—beyond Inference.
‘*Unknowable*’—beyond the reach of external as well as internal
organs.—(29)

029	What is coupled with delusion, what has the character of an undiscernible mass, what cannot be fathomed by reasoning, what cannot be fully known, one must consider (as the quality of) Darkness.
