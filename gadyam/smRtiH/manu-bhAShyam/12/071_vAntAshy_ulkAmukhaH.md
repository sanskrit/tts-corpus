The Brāhmaṇa fallen off from his own duty becomes a ‘fire-mouthed’ Preta feeding on vomitings; and the Kṣatriya a ‘foul-nosed’ Preta feeding on impure substances and dead bodies.—(71)

The text proceeds to indicate the states fallen into by those who fall
off from their duty.

The *Preta* feeds upon vomitings; and its mouth keeps flaming like a
fire-brand.

‘*Kuṇapa*’—dead body.

‘*Kūṭapūtanaḥ*’—one from whose nostrils foul smell emanates.

‘*Kaṭapūtanaḥ*’ is another reading; ‘*Kaṭapūtana*’ b eing the name of a
being of the ‘*Piśāca*’ species, who keeps hovering in
cremation-grounds.—(71)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.220), in the sense that the man
neglecting his duties suffers the same tortures as the *Ulkāmukha* and
the rest.

071	A Brahmana who has fallen off from his duty (becomes) an Ulkamukha Preta, who feeds on what has been vomited; and a Kshatriya, a Kataputana (Preta), who eats impure substances and corpses.
