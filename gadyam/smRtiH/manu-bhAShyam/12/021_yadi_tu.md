If on the other hand he practises vice for the most part, and virtue only in a small degree,—then, becoming deserted by those substances, he suffers the torments inflicted by Yama.—(21)

     M G J: mātrābhyaḥ (see under verse 16 for my conjecture)

- <u>उच्यते</u> । न भौतिकं सरीरं नाप्य् अशरीरस्य यातनाः । किं तर्हि, अत्यन्तविलक्षणे ते मानुषसरीरे ऽतो ऽन्यान्य् एतानि मृदुस्निग्धसुकुमारशरीरारम्भकाण्य् अत्यन्तविलक्षणानि[^६७] ।

     M G: -vilakṣaṇā-

- दुःखाभिघातनिष्कृत्या **परित्यक्त** उच्यते । यानि शरीराणि स्वर्गभोग्यानि[^६८] **तैः परित्यक्तः** ॥ १२.२१ ॥

“It has been said under 10 that the body of misbehaved persons is made
out of *five constituents*; how is it that here the man is said to be
‘*deserted*’ by the substances?”

Our answer is that the man has no *material body*,—and yet there can be
no ‘torments’ for one devoid of a body; so that the bodies of men here
referred to are of an entirely distinct kind; and when the man is
described as ‘*deserted by the substances*,’ the *substances* meant are
those of peculiar character, such as are productive of exceptionally
soft and smooth and delicate bodies; and ‘*deserted*’ means that he has
expiated for his sins by the pain suffered; and what he is deserted by
are those bodies with which people become invested in Heaven.—(21)
