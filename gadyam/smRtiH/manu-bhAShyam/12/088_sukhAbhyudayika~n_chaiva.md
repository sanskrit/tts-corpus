“The *Vedic Act* has all along been described as of the *active* kind;
how is it that it is now said to be of *two kinds*?”

There is no force in this objection. Where it was said that the *Vedic
Act* is of the *active* kind, what was meant was that the greater part
of it is of that’ kind, as is found in the ease of the *Agnihotra* and
other acts; but the same cannot be said of ‘renunciation’ and acts of
that kind;—and yet both sets are equally ‘Vedic.’

‘*Conducive to happiness and prosperity*’—*i.e*., which serve these
purposes; and—^(‘)*Conducive to the highest good*’—that which
accomplishes this purpose. These two terms are to be construed
respectively with the foregoing terms (‘active’ and ‘passive’).—(88)
