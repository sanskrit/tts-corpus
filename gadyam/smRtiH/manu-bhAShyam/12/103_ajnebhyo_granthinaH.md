Better than ignoramuses are those who ‘read the books’; better than the ‘reader of books’ are those who ‘retain’ them; better than the ‘retainers’ are those who have ‘knowledge’; and better than those having ‘knowledge’ are those who act.—(103)

‘*Ignoramuses*’—ignorant men; those who do not read at all.

‘*Who* *read the* *books*’—those who have studied the texts, and are
just able to mention them.

Better than these are those who ‘*retain*’ them; those who read the
books with care; while the former do not read with sufficient care. The
‘*retainers*’ also are of *the books*.

What the *superiority* of these latter means is that they are qualified
for being engaged in recitations, for receiving gifts, and so forth.

‘*Those who have knowledge*,’ are qualified for all purposes; and hence
these are still better. Recitations and prayers, when done with
knowledge, are productive of more excellent results. This is what has
been thus described—‘Whatever one does with knowledge, faith and with
due regard to the esoteric teachings, turns out to be most effective.’

‘*Those who act*’—Those who, without any hesitation, act up to the
teachings of the Veda; and who never doubt their correctness.

This also is meant to be mere praise: Mere study of the Veda is capable
of accomplishing the ends of man,—how much more so the knowledge of what
is contained in it!—(103)

‘*Ajñebhyaḥ*’.—‘Entirely ignorant’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa), ‘who have
not read the Veda’ (Nandana),—‘who have learnt a little’ (Govindarāja
and Kullūka).

‘*Granthinaḥ*’.—‘Forgetful students’ (Kullūka and Nandana),—‘those who
learn the verbal text alone and do not ponder, over the meaning’,
(Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 73), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Granthinaḥ*,’ who can read only with the help of the
book,—‘*Dhāriṇaḥ*,’ who can read without the help of the
book,—‘*Jñāninaḥ*,’ who have studied the scriptures and know their
meaning.

103	(Even forgetful) students of the (sacred) books are more distinguished than the ignorant, those who remember them surpass the (forgetful) students, those who possess a knowledge (of the meaning) are more distinguished than those who (only) remember (the words), men who follow (the teaching of the texts) surpass those who (merely) know (their meaning).
