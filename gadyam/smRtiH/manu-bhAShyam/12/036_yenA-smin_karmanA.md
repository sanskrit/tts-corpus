When, by a certain act, the man desires great fame in this world, and does not mind failure—this should be understood to partake of the quality of ‘Rajas.’—(36)

The motive being—‘by doing this act I shall obtain praise in the
world,’—if one performs sacrifices, austerities or other righteous acts;
as also such acts for winning fame as giving gifts to the beggars at
sacred places, bragging against the king, expounding the scriptures
before Śūdras, and so forth.

‘*Great*.’—This implies that what is objectionable is the doing of the
act with the *sole* motive of obtaining fame; there is nothing wrong if
the fame comes, only by the way; if, for instance, people talk of the
man’s righteous deeds, when these are done only through righteousness
(and not for any other purpose), such fame does not vitiate the moral
quality of the act; as has been declared to be the case with the man in
picking up ‘sugar cane,’ as described by Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana in the story of
the *Mahāhhārata*—‘When a man is gathering sugarcane, he gathers, along
with it, also grasses and creepers; and in the same manner, the man,
when treading the path of righteousness, also obtains fame, happiness
and wealth.’

‘*Failure*’—of the results to appear;—‘*he does not mind*’—feels no
sorrow; or ‘*failure*’ may mean the *non-completion of the act*.—(36)
