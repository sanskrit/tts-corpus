Proneness to take up, unnecessarily, the performance of acts, conducive
to perceptible and imperceptible results.

These are the characteristics of the quality of ‘*Rajas*.’

‘*Impatience*’—loss of mental equanimity at even slight disturbing
causes.

If we read ‘*dainya*’ (*for* ‘-*dhairya*’), it should he understood to
mean *loss of ambition, humiliation*.

‘*Commission of improper acts*’— the performance of such acts as are
forbidden by the scriptures.

‘*Addiction to sensual objects*’—being repeatedly attracted by objects
of sensual pleasure.—(32)

**

*Maitryupaniṣad* (3.5).

*Yājñavalkya* (3.137-138).—‘Addicted to bad acts, impatient, active,
attached to objects of sense, a man abounds in the attribute of *Rajas*,
and is re-born among men. Lethargic, cruel in bis acts, covetous,
heretic, addicted to begging, careless, of bad character, a man abounds
in the attribute of *Tamas*, and is born among animals.’
