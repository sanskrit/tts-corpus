Those dealing in grains should be made to pay one-eighth part of their
profits.

The term ‘*viṭ*’ here stands for *the people*.

For those dealing in gold, the tax is one-twentieth part of their
profits.

‘*Śūdras discharge their dues by work*.’—They should not be made to pay
any taxes. So also craftsmen and artisans. With regard to them it has
been laid down (in 7.138) that ‘they shall work for the king one day
every month’; and the present text permits the taking of more work from
them in abnormal times.—(120)

“According to Medhātithi, the first line refers to the profits of
subjects dealing in corn or in gold. From the former the king may take,
in times of distress, one-eighth, and from the latter one-twentieth; the
second line indicates that artisans who, according to verse 7.138, in
ordinary times, furnish one piece of work in each month, may be made to
work more for the king.—According to Govindarāja and Kullūka,
husband-men shall give from the increments on grain one-eighth (instead
of one-twelfth, and in the direst distress one-fourth, according to
verse 118), from all increments on gold and so forth amounting to more
than a *Kārṣāpaṇa*, one-twentieth, instead of one-fiftieth, as
prescribed above, 7.130.—Nārāyaṇa says that the tax on grain is to be
one-fourth in the case of Śūdras, and one-eighth in the case of Vaiśyas,
that the tax on every thing else is to be at least one *Kārṣāpaṇa* ‘in
twenty,’ and that artisans who work for wages shall pay the same
rate.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 263), which adds
that the verb ‘*dadyuḥ*’ is to be supplied.

*Vaśiṣṭha* (12.37).—‘They quote a verse proclaimed by Manu referring to
duties and taxes—“No duty is paid on a sum less than a *Kārṣāpaṇa*;
there is no tax on livelihood gained by art; nor on an infant, nor on a
messenger, nor on what has been received as alms, nor on the remnants of
property left after robbery, nor on a *Śrotriya*, nor on an ascetic, nor
on a sacrifice.”’
