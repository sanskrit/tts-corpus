If a man, threatened with loss of life, eats food from stray sources, he does not become tainted with sin, just as Ākāśa is not defiled by mud.—(104)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The preceding texts have spoken of receiving gifts from improper
persons; the present verse permits the partaking of food defiled by the
ownership of low men.

‘*From stray sources*’—*i.e*., irrespectively of the caste and actions
of the owner of the food.

The rest is all purely declamatory.—(104)
