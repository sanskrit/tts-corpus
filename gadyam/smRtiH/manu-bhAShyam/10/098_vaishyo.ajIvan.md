<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse permits the Śūdra’s occupation for the Vaiśya, when ‘*unable
to subsist by his own occupations*’— such as washing of the feet and so
forth.

‘*Avoiding all improper acts*’— The sweeping of offals and such acts are
‘improper’; and all this should be avoided.

‘*He shall desist as soon as he is able to do so*.’—This is applicable
to all.

Some people have remarked that the clear indication of the text is that
what is said here is meant to apply to the *Brāhmaṇa* and the *Kṣatriya*
also.

And in regard to this another party raises the question—How can the
*Brāhmaṇa* ever have recourse to the occupations of the *Śūdra?*

The answer given by the other party is that it has been declared
that—‘High and low are the functions of the two castes; barring the two
middle ones, the rest are common to all’. (?)

This however is not right. The text does not mean that the occupations
of the *Śūdra* are permitted for the Brāhmaṇa; the exact meaning of
‘*desisting as soon as he is able*’ b eing as we have explained it,—that
it is applicable to all.—(98)

*Viṣṇu* (2.15).—‘In times of distress, each caste may follow the
occupation of that next below it in rank.’
