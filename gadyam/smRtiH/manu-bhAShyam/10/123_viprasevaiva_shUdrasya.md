The service of the Brāhmaṇa is described as the distinctive duty of the Śūdra; everything else that he does is fruitless for him.—(123)

ब्राह्मणशुश्रूषैव मुख्यः शूद्रस्य धर्मः । **ततो यद् अन्यद्** व्रतोपवासादि **कुरुते तद् अस्य निष्फलम्** । न तु दानपाकयज्ञादीनाम् अस्य प्रतिषेधः, प्रत्यक्षविधानात् । इतरप्रतिषेधो ब्राह्मणशुश्रूषास्तुत्यर्थः ॥ १०.१२३ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The serving of the Brāhmaṇas is the chief duty for the Śūdra.

Hence ‘*everything else*’—in the shape of observances and fasts—‘*that
he does is fruitless for him*.’

This should not be understood to be the prohibition of such acts as
making gifts, offering the ‘*Pākayajñas*’ and so forth; since all these
have been distinctly enjoined for him. In fact this prohibition of
‘everything else’ is only meant to indicate the importance of ‘serving
Brāhmaṇas.’—(123)

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 161);—in
*Mitākṣarā* (1.120);—and the whole verse in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra p.
421), to the effect that the highest duty of the Śūdra is saving the
Brāhmaṇa, that of the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya being meant only as a
means of livelihood;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* II (p. 728);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 126);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 46),
which explains ‘*viśiṣṭam*’ as ‘excellent,’ as conducive to both *merit*
and *livelihood*, and ‘*niṣphalam*’ as ‘very little effective,’ as
conducive to *livelihood only*.

*Mahābhārata* (Aparārka, p. 162).—‘The Brāhmaṇa shall he served by the
Śūdra from a distance, like the fire.’

*Gautama* (10.61).—‘The *Ārya*, under whose protection the Śūdra places
himself, should support him, even if he becomes unable to work.’

123	The service of Brahmanas alone is declared (to be) an excellent occupation for a Sudra; for whatever else besides this he may perform will bear him no fruit.
