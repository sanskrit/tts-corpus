By the muttering of sacred texts and by the offering of libations is the guilt incurred by teaching and sacrificing removed; while that incurred by receiving gifts is removed only by renouncing them and by austerities.—(111)

‘*The guilt is removed*’—destroyed—‘*by the muttering of sacred texts
and by the offering of libations*.’ Hence there is not much harm in
this.

But the guilt incurred in the receiving of gifts is removed only by the
‘*renouncing*’— of the gifts—and ‘*by austerities*’—laid down later on,
under 11.195.—(111)

111	The guilt incurred by offering sacrifices for teaching (unworthy men) is removed by muttering (sacred texts) and by burnt offerings, but that incurred by accepting gifts (from them) by throwing (the gifts) away and by austerities.
