The sense of the verse is that so long as the less reprehensible means
of subsistence, in the shape of sacrificing and teaching, are available,
the Brāhmaṇa should not have recourse to the receiving of Improper
Gifts.—(109)

**(verses 10.109-111)  
**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.45-47).—‘Property received from outcasts, after forming
alliances with them, either by teaching the Veda or by marriage, must he
relinquished. Let him not associate with such men. It is declared in the
Veda that he who has associated with an outcast becomes pure by reciting
the Saṃhitā of his Veda, proceeding in the northerly direction, and
fasting. They quote also a verse to the effect that a sinner is
liberated from guilt by tormenting his body, by austerities, and by
reciting the Veda; be becomes free also by bestowing gifts.’

*Viṣṇu* (54.28).—‘Those Brāhmaṇas who have acquired property by base
acts become free from sin by relinquishing it and by reciting Veda-texts
and practising austerities.’

*Āpastamba* (1.28, 11-12).—‘Enjoyments taken unrighteously one shall
give up; be shall say—“I and sin do not dwell together.” Clothing
himself with a garment reaching from the navel down to the knee, bathing
daily, morn, noon and evening, eating food which contains neither milk
nor pungent condiments, nor salt, he shall not enter a house for twelve
years. After that, he may be taken as purified.’
