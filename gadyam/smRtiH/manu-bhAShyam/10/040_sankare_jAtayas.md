The ‘*occupations*’ that have been just described,—such as *dealing in
bamboos* and so forth,—by means of these even the little known castes of
the ‘*Sopāka*’ and the rest can be known.

All these have been described through the character of their fathers and
mothers.

‘*Manifest or unmanifest*,’—they shall be known as belonging to those
castes.

In the case of the ‘*Āyogavī*,’ the description was through the caste of
the *mother*, and it was through that of the father in the case of the
description of the ‘*Andhra*’ and the ‘*Meda*’ as born from the
‘*Niṣāda*’ and the ‘*Vaidehaka*’ fathers respectively.—(40)
