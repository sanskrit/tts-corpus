Savoury articles should be bartered for savoury articles, but never salt for another savoury article,—cooked food, for cooked food, and sesamum for corn, in equal quantities.—(94)

‘*Savoury articles*’— described above—‘*should* *be* *buttered for
savoury substances* .’ That is, one should receive the *Āmalakī* and
other *acids* after giving, in exchange, sugar and other sweet
substances. But in no case should salt be given in exchange for any
other ‘savoury substance.’

‘*Lavaṇam tilaiḥ*’ is another reading; by which the prohibition would be
only in regard to the bartering of salt for *sesamum* only, and not any
other substance.

‘*Cooked food*’— such as fried flour, cooked rice and so forth—should be
bartered for other kinds of ‘cooked food’—cakes and the like.

‘*Sesamum shall be bartered for corns*’—Vrīhi and the rest—‘*in equal
quantities*.’ That is, given one seer (of sesamum), he shall receive one
seer in exchange; more or less shall not be received, through any
consideration of relative values.

‘Bartering’ also is regarded as a kind of *selling*; on the ground that
the root to ‘*sell*,’ ‘ *Kṛṛ* (?)’is found mentioned among the roots
signifying the act of ‘exchanging.’

This however is not right. Because Gautama has indicated the difference
between the two, by speaking of ‘selling’ and ‘bartering’ in the same
sentence. So that when things are given on the receipt of the rupee or
such tokens, it is ‘selling’; and it is ‘bartering’ when one article is
received in exchange for another article.—(94)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.39), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Kṛtānna*’ is cooked food, and this should be exchanged with
cooked food; it notes the. reading ‘*Kṛtānnañcākṛtannena*’, and explains
it as ‘cooked food should be exchanged for uncooked rice and other
grains’.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 933);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 233), which
explains ‘*nimātavyāḥ*’ as ‘should be exchanged’;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra p. 431), which adds that the law laid down regarding the selling
of sesamum applies to that of *rasas* also;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
124);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 429).

*Gautama* (7.16-23).—‘But it is permissible to barter one kind of
substances used for flavouring for others, and animals. Salt and
prepared food must not be bartered, nor sesamum. But for present use, an
equal quantity of uncooked food may be exchanged for cooked food.—But if
no other course is possible, a Brāhmaṇa may support himself in any way
except by following the occupations of a Śūdra. Some people permit even
this in case his life is in danger.’

*Āpastamba* (1.20.14-16—1.21.1-4).—‘The exchange of one of these
(above-mentioned goods) for the other is likewise unlawful. But food may
be exchanged for food, and slaves for slaves, and condiments for
condiments, and perfumes for perfumes and learning for learning. Let him
traffic with lawful merchandise which he has not bought, with *Muñja*
grass, *Balvaja* -g rass, roots and fruits; and with grass and wood
which have not been worked up. He shall not be too eager for such
livelihood. If he obtains another livelihood, he shall leave off
trading.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (2.37-39).—‘Substances used for flavouring may be bartered
for other substances of the same kind, be it for one more valuable or
for one worth less. But salt must never be exchanged for other
substances used for flavouring. It is permitted to barter sesamum, rice,
cooked food, learning, and slaves.’
