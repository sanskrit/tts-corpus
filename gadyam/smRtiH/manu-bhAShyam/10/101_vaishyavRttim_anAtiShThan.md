‘*Does not adopt*’—*i.e*., being unwilling to adopt What this means is
that, in the event of the Kṣatriya’s occupation being not available, he
may have recourse either to the receiving of gifts from wrong persons or
to the occupation of the Vaiśya,—both these standing on the same
footing; the occupation of the Kṣatriya however would be superior to the
receiving of improper gifts.

Or, ‘*does not adopt the occupation of the Vaiśya*’ may also mean—‘the
occupation of the Vaiśya being not available to him.’ In this case, the
receiving of improper gifts would be inferior to the occupation of the
Vaiśya.

‘*Resolved to stick to his own path*.’—This indicates that this sums up
all the occupations permitted during times of distress.

‘*Distressed through want of livelihood, and Pining*’—*i.e*., fallen in
ruin.—(101)

**(verses 10.101-108)  
**

*Gautama* (7.4).—‘In times of distress, it is permissible to offer
sacrifices for men of all castes, to teach them and to accept gifts from
them.’

*Āpastamba* (?.18.5-7, 14-15),—‘In times of distress, if he is unable to
keep himself, he may eat food obtained from anybody, after having
touched it with gold, or with fire....... In times of distress, even the
food of a Śūdra, who lives under one’s protection for the sake of
spiritual merit, may be eaten. He may eat it, touching it once with gold
or with fire.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (27.9).—‘Through sacrificing for wicked people, through
teaching them, through intermarrying with them, or through accepting
their gifts, learned Brāhmaṇas do not contract guilt; for a learned
Brāhmaṇa resembles fire and the sun.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.41).—‘Agriculture, arts, service, learning,
money-lending, cart, hill, attendance, land covered with wood and water,
king, alms-begging,—these are the means of livelihood in times of
distress.’
