‘*During the day*’—they ‘*go about on business*,’—‘*i.e*., for the
purpose of effecting purchases and sales; or on the King’s business, for
looking after rejoicings in the city and such other purposes. All this
time too they shall be ‘*distinguished by royal signs*’—*i.e*., marked
by such signs as those of the thunderbolt and the like, which may be
determined by the King;—or by carrying on their shoulder the axe or the
chopper or some such weapon as is used in the execution of
criminals.—(55)

(Govindarāja),—‘by iron ornaments and peacock’s feathers’
(Nārāyaṇa),—‘branded on the forehead and other parts of the body’
(Rāghavananda).
