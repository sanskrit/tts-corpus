Better one’s own duty imperfectly performed, and not the duty of another performed perfectly; he who subsists by the function of another, instantly falls off from his caste.—(97)

पूर्वस्य विधेर् निन्दार्थवादो ऽयम् । यो यस्य विहितो **धर्मो** जात्याश्रयेण, **विगुणो** ऽप्य् अपरिपूराङ्गो ऽपि युक्तो ऽनुष्ठातुम्, न **परधर्मः** सर्वाङ्गसंपूर्णो ऽपि । अत्र निन्दार्थवादः **परधर्मेणेति** ॥ १०.९७ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is a deprecatory declamation in support of the foregoing
injunction.

If a certain duty has been prescribed for one, in reference to his
caste,—even though this be ‘*performed imperfectly*’—*i.e*., incomplete
in its details,—it is right to perform that, and not the duty of another
man, even though complete in all its details.

In support of this there is the deprecatory declamation—‘*He who
subsists, etc., etc*.’— (97)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.41);—in *Aparārka* (p. 935);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 233), to the effect that even in times of distress
it is better for the Brāhmaṇa to stick to his own functions than take to
others;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 123).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Vaśiṣṭha* (2. 2 2-23).—‘Those who are unable to live by their own
occupation may adopt that of the next inferior caste; but never that of
a higher caste.’

*Viṣṇu* (2.15).—‘In times of distress, each caste may follow the
occupation of that next below it in rank.’

अयम् अपरो निन्दार्थवादः । उत्कृष्टवर्णवृत्त्यनुष्ठानप्रतिषेधे स्वधर्मः परधर्म इति । प्रकरणात् तु वृत्तिविषयो धर्मशब्दः ॥ १०.९७ ॥

097	It is better (to discharge) one's own (appointed) duty incompletely than to perform completely that of another; for he who lives according to the law of another (caste) is instantly excluded from his own.
