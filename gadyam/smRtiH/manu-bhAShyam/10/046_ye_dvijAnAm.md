‘*Base-born*’—in the natural as well as the inverse order. ‘*Born of
transgression*,’—the distinction between these and the former is like
that between the ‘*go*’ (General term) and the ‘*balīvarda*’ (Particular
term).

‘*Services*’—menial duties—for the benefit of ‘twice-born’ persons.

‘*Subsist*’—maintain themselves.

‘*Lowly*’—because of their menial character.—These are going to be
described.—(46)

*Mahābhārata* (13.48.32).—(Same as Manu 50.)

*Viṣṇu* (16.8-13).—‘*Āyogavas* should live by artistic
performances;—*Pukkasas*, by hunting;—*Māgadhas*, by proclaiming the
good qualities;—*Caṇḍālas*, by executing criminals sentenced to
death;—*Vāidehakas*, by keeping women and profiting by what they
earn;—*Sūtas*, by training horses.’

*Śaṅkha* (Aparārka, p. 119).—‘The livelihood of the *Rathakāra* consists
of training horses, driving chariots, masonry and the teaching of the
science of Architecture.’
