*Śukranīti* (4.4, 80-81).—‘Viśvāmitra, Mātaṅga, Vaśiṣṭha, Nārada and
others became elevated by special penances, not by birth.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.96).—‘Caste becomes elevated during the fifth or the
seventh generation; similarly after five or seven generations one
acquires that caste of which he has followed the occupations.’

*Gautama* (4.22-24).—‘In the seventh generation, men obtain a change of
caste, being either raised to a higher one or degraded to a lower one.
The venerable teacher declares that this happens in the fifth
generation, and the same rule applies to those born from parents of
different castes that are intermediate between two of the castes
originally created by Brahmā.’

*Āpastamba* (2, 11.10-11).—‘In successive births, men of the lower
castes are born in the next higher one, if they have fulfilled their
duties. In successive births, men of the higher castes are born in the
next lower one, if they have neglected their duties.’
