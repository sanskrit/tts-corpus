Viśvāmitra is a well-known great sage. On one occasion, when he suffered
much from hunger, ‘*he proceeded to eat the haunch of a dog, receiving
it from the hands of a Carṇḍāla*.’

The ‘*dog’s* *haunch*’ has been mentioned with a view to show that there
is harm in the eating of not only such food as has been defiled, but
also of that which is defective by its very nature;—the sense of the
verse being that in times of distress one may take even such food as is
tainted with all kinds of defects.—(108)

See Mahābhārata 12.141.28 etc. seg.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 935);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
234). which explains ‘*śvajāghanī*’ as the loins of a dog;—and in
*Parāśaramadhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 326).
