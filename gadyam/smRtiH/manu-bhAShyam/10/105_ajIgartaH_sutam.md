**अजीगर्तो** नाम ऋषिः । स क्षुत्परिपीडितः पुत्रं **सुतं** शुनःशेपनामानं **हन्तुम् उपासर्पत्** प्रचक्रमे । न चासौ क्रव्याद इति युज्यते । शौनःशेपम् आख्यानं बह्वृचि सुप्रसिद्धम् (ऐत्ब् ७.१३) । नात्र विस्तर आगमस्योपयुज्यते । परमार्थस् तु प्रकृतिरूपो ऽर्थवादः । एवं सर्व एते द्रष्टव्याः ॥ १०.१०५ ॥

‘*Ajīgarta*’—The sage of that name—‘*suffering from hunger*, *went
forward to* *kill* *his son*’—Sunaḥśepa, and yet he was not regarded as
‘carnivorous.’

The story of Sunaḥśepa occurs in the Ṛgveda; and it is not necessary for
us to dilate upon what occurs in the scriptures.

As a matter of fact however, this is a declamatory statement in the form
of the assertion of an act done by somebody.

All such passages should be understood to be the same.—(105)
