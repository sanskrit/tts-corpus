‘*Devoid of caste*’—fallen off from the four castes.

‘*Unknown*’—*i.e*., there being doubts regarding his parentage, known to
be born illegitimately.

‘*By acts*’—going to be described,—as also by the distinctive features
of their character,—they shall be recognised. That is, if a man is found
to be addicted to wicked acts, and of cruel disposition, and if his
parentage is doubtful, it should be concluded that he is of low birth,
born illegitimately.—(57)

**(verses 10.57-61)  
**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (18.7).—‘They quote the following—“One may know by their
deeds those who have been begotten secretly, and to whom the stigma of
springing from unions in the inverse order of the caste attaches,
because they are destitute of virtue and good conduct.”’

*Viṣṇu* (16.17).—‘All members of the mixed castes may be found out by
their deeds, whether their descent has been kept secret or is generally
known.’

*Mahābhārata* (13.48.41-44).—‘The purity of one’s birth can be found out
from his deeds (then the same as Manu 58 and 59).’
