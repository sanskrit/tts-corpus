इदं तयोर् जीविकाकर्म । **शस्त्रं** खड्गादि । **अस्त्रं** तन्मन्त्राः धनुर्वेदप्रसिद्धाः । अयम् अप्य् उक्तानुवाद एव । **वणिक्पशु**शब्दौ कर्मान्तर्भावेन[^१६१] प्रयुक्तौ, वणिज्या पशुपालनं च । यद्य् अप्य् अध्ययनादिधर्माः सर्वेषां सन्ति तथापि प्राधान्यम् एतेषाम् ॥ १०.७९ ॥

These are their functions, which serve to provide them with the means of
subsistence.

‘*Arms*’—The sword and the rest, as also the incantations bearing upon
the use of these.

This verse also is only reiterative of what has gone before; the terms
‘*vaṇik*’ and ‘*paśu*’ (used here) standing for what have been spoken of
before as ‘*vāṇijya*’ and ‘*paśupālaṇa*.’ Though studying and the rest
are the ‘duty’ of all the three twice-born castes, yet they are chiefly
so for these two.—(79)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 397), to the effect
that the wielding of weapons for the protection of the weak is the duty
of the Kṣatriya only;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (1.119).
