As the Śūdra begets an ‘alien’ being on a Brāhmaṇa woman,—even so an alien propagates on females of the four castes, a still more alien being.—(30)

The birth of sons among persons of the ‘inverse’ castes themselves, from
each other’s wives has been described. Now the birth of sons from women
of the four castes is described.

The verbal root ‘*Sū*’ (to *be born*) has been used in this text as
synonymous with to *produce*; ‘*prasūyate*’ moaning *begets*.

This is indicated in the next verse.—(30)

030	Just as a Sudra begets on a Brahmana female a being excluded (from the Aryan community), even so (a person himself) excluded pro creates with (females of) the four castes (varna, sons) more (worthy of being) excluded (than he himself).
