<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This deprecation of Agriculture is meant to eulogise the other
occupations of the Vaiśya, and to forbid agriculture itself. If it had
been to be entirely forbidden, the permitting of it (under 82) would
become absolutely pointless.—(83)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 936), to the effect that even
when taking to the Vaiśya’s livelihood, the Brāhmaṇa shall avoid
cultivating land himself;—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācara, p. 426), as
prohibiting the Brāhmaṇa’s cultivation of land by himself.
