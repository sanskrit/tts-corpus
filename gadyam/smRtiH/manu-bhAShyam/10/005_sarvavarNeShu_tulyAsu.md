“Who are these that are called ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ and the rest? We cannot
perceive any difference among men. The determination of the caste is
dependent upon a knowledge of individuals belonging to the caste; and
individuals, devoid as they are of any knowledge of the disposition of
the component atoms, cannot indicate any difference among the castes.
Nor is there any difference in the figures of the ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ and the
‘*Kṣatriya*’ as there is in those of the ‘cow’ and the ‘horse,’ for
instance,—by virtue of which the said castes could be perceptible by the
eye Nor are the said castes discernible by any other acts; as, for
instance, the nature of the oil or the melted butter can be discerned by
smelling or tasting. Nor again can the difference among them be
discerned by differences in such details as those of purity, conduct,
colour of the hair, and so forth; because these details are almost
always found to be mixed up. Further, actual usage is dependent upon
men, and as men are mostly deceptive, the character of anything cannot
be ascertained by a mere reference to them.”

It is in view of these difficulties (in the ascertaining of a man’s
caste) that the author is asserting here the definition of the castes.

‘*Among all castes*,’— the definition that is applicable is that those
born of women ‘*0f* *equal status*’—of the same caste as the
husband,—these women being the ‘*wives*’—lawfully wedded consorts,—*are
to be regarded as* the same. That is, in most cases, the caste of the
child born of parents legally married is the same as that of its
parents.

Since the term ‘*wife*’ is a relative term, it follows that the person
who has married her is the ‘father’ of the child. So that the meaning
comes to be that the child is of the same caste as the parents, when it
is born of the woman from that same person who has wedded her.

The epithet ‘*virgin*’ has been added, and it precludes the possibility
of a remarried woman being regarded as the ‘wife,’—as also of the mother
of the ‘*Sahoḍa*’ and ‘*Kānīna*’ sons.

*Objection*:— “As a matter of fact, there is no *marriage* - *sacrament*
in the case of these latter; since it has been declared (Manu 8. 226)
that ‘the sacred texts recited at the marriage-ceremony are applicable
to maidens only.’ Though verse 9.173 declares that ‘the child belongs to
the person who *married* her,’ where the mention of the term ‘marry’
indicates that there is legal sacrament in the cases in question also,
yet all that this text can be taken as indicating is the *possibility*
(of the sacrament), and there is nothing in it to indicate that it
refers to something actually *enjoined*; so that in this text all that
‘the person marrying’ can mean is ‘the person who accepted her,’—the
verbal root signifying mere *acceptance*; and what the text means is
that ‘when a man has accepted a girl for his wife, after having cheated
her father and kinsmen, if a son happens to be born from her, he belongs
to that man.’

There is in fact no sacrament in the case of *remarried* women; in
regard to whom also it has been laid down that—‘she is fit for a second
nuptial ceremony, only *if she he still a virgin*’ (9.176). In
connection with the girl who as ‘gone away and come back’ also, we find
the term ‘*again*’ used (‘she may be married *again*’), which implies
that she belongs to her husband. But none of these are entitled to
associate with the ‘duly wedded consort;’ because the term ‘*paint*,’
‘consort,’ connotes ‘co-operation at sacrificial rites.’ From all this
it would seem that the qualification ‘*if she be a virgin*’ becomes
superfluous. The older commentators read ‘*nārīṣu*’ (women) in place of
‘*patnīṣu*’ in the text But this also is nothing. If we had the
qualification of ‘virginity’, only then would sons born of *unmarried*
women belong to the same caste as the father. By using the term
‘*patnī*’ (consort) however it becomes clearly indicated that the women
meant are only such as have been married with due religious rites. As
for the girl with whom a man has intercourse before they are married,
she may be a ‘*virgin*’ but certainly not a consort. Thus then it
becomes necessary to explain the use and purport of the qualification
‘*virgin*’.”

The answer to the above is as follows:—It has been argued above that
“the remarried women are not ‘consorts,’ because they are not entitled
to co-operate at sacrificial rites.” But if such girls were wedded, this
*wedding* itself would constitute a ‘sacrificial rite,’ since even at
this ceremony *offerings* are made to Pūsan, Aryaman and Varuṇa; and
‘*offering*’ and ‘*sacrifice*’ are synonymous terms. Hence these girls
also would be ‘consorts.’ In fact, the right view to take is that,
inasmuch as they are no longer ‘maidens,’ they are not fit for the
wedding *ceremony*; and it is on this ground that they cannot be
‘consorts.’ And even so the qualification ‘virgin’ being apparently
superfluous, we proceed to explain its use. As a matter of fact, the
term ‘consort’ is found to be applied, though figuratively, even to such
women as are not entitled to *co-operate at sacrificial rites*; *e.g*.,
in such expressions as ‘the washerman’s consort’ (though no sacrificial
performance is possible for the washerman). Similarly in the case of the
‘kept’ woman also, the name ‘housewife’ is applied, in the sense of the
‘wife’; and this on the ground of certain points on which such a woman
resembles the real *wife*. Though it is true that, so long as a word can
be used in its direct sense, it is not right to have recourse to its
figurative sense,—yet what the writer does is to explain, in a friendly
spirit, to dull-headed people, the impropriety of entertaining certain
notions; specially what notion is there that may not be entertained by
dull-headed people?

The qualification ‘*in the natural order*’ has been added in view of
what follows later on.

Those who adopt the reading ‘*ta eva te*’, for them also the meaning is
the same—*i.e*., ‘they belong to the same caste.’

The following arguments have been urged in connection with this
subject:—“What is the authority at the root of this and similar
assertions made by the authors of *Smṛtis*? Inasmuch as these do not
make mention of *anything to be done*, they cannot stand on the same
footing as the teachings regarding *Virtue and Vice* (what should be
done and What should be avoided); and we have already shown that there
is no other authority possible. If another *Smṛti-* text were cited as
the requisite authority, then this would come to be a case of ‘the blind
leading the blind’; as has been made clear under the verse dealing with
the sources of knowledge of ‘*Dharma*’ (2.6).”

The answer to the above is as follows:—The authority consists in the
practices of experienced men; just as in the case of the *Smṛti* -rules
bearing on the *correctness of words* (*i.e*., grammar). It is true that
the said practices may be defective and misleading. But it is there that
the rules laid down in the *Smṛti* come in useful, as serving to control
them. Specially as it cannot be said that the ‘*Smṛti*,’ ‘recollection,’
of learned men is wrong; for persons intent upon the following of the
scriptures are universally known as exceptionally trustworthy; and the
basic authority for these would consist in eternal usage.

It is the theory of some people that men who are steeped in the study of
the *Smṛti* and belong to certain selected noble families may be able to
have a direct (intuitive) knowledge of things. This we have dealt with
in detail in the *Smṛtiviteka*.

“In another *Smṛti* (Yājñavalkya, 1.20) there are no such qualifying
conditions as we find in the present text; all that is said there
is—‘Children born to men of a certain caste from women of the same
caste, are also of the same caste;—sons born of unblamable marriages are
the perpetuators of the race’;—where the first half indicates the
*caste* of the child, and the latter declares the fact of the products
of the ‘*Brahma*’ and other marriages being ‘perpetuators of the race.’
Now in this text, all that is said is ‘sons born to a man from women of
the same caste,’ and there is no mention of the name ‘*patnī*,’
‘*consort*.’”

How can it be said that there is no such qualification, when it is added
later on that ‘this rule applies to the case of *wedded* women’ (Yājña,
1.92)? Further, what if there is no qualifying phrase in this other
text? A qualified text is always more authoritative than an unqualified
one; *as perception* is always more reliable than *non-perception*; it
is just possible that the qualifying condition, actually present, may
have been seen by one, but missed by the other (writer).

From all this it follows that the ‘recollection of learned men’ is
authoritative, on account of the possibility of its being based upon the
*Śruti*.

“The definition provided by the verse is not correct, since it does not
include all that should be included. For instance, under the definition
‘Brāhmaṇa-hood’ could never belong to the ‘son taken along with the
mother,’ the ‘maiden-born son,’ or the ‘son of the remarried woman.’ It
might be argued that—‘as in the cases of the *son born of another man to
an unwidowed woman, the son born to a widow* and the *soil-born* son, so
in the case of these sons also, it is intended that Brāhmaṇa-hood should
not belong to them.’ But in that case, what would be the caste of these?
Further, if the ‘son of the unwidowed woman born of another man,’ and
the ‘son of the widow’ were not *Brāhmaṇas*, there could be no
possibility of anyone thinking of feeding them at *Śrāddhas*, and hence
there would be no point in the prohibition (contained in 3.155, 156) of
such feeding. Then again, such a view would he contrary to other *Smṛti*
-texts. For instance, we read—‘This rule that I have described pertains
to sons of the same caste as the father.’ (*Yājñavalkya*, 2.33).

“Further, as a rule, the *definition* is the same as the *thing
defined*,—the only difference being that ‘what is to be defined’ is not
known, while ‘the definition’ is well known. *E.g*. it being doubtful
(not known) who *Devadatta* is, we have the *definition*—‘he who is
wearing the armlet and the ear-ring, of the developed chest and rounded
arms’ (all which is already known). What the present text does is to
declare,—in answer to the question *who is a Brāhmaṇa*?—that ‘*he is one
born of a Brāhmaṇa*;’ and this is exactly as if, on being asked—‘what is
a crow?’—one were to say ‘it is what is born of a crow!’ In fact, it is
still to be known what is that ‘Brāhmaṇa-hood’ that belongs to the
father.

“The definition is illogical also: In the world one born of a female
from a male of the same genus always belongs to that same genus; *e.g*.,
what is born of the cow is of the genus of the ‘cow,’ what is born of
the ‘mare’ is of the genus of the horse’ \[and certainly in all these
eases *marriage* does not enter as a necessary factor\].”

The answer to the above is as follows:—First of all it has been
asked—what would be the caste of certain kinds of sons? Well, what is
the need for any ‘caste?’ They belong to the genus ‘man;’ and even
without having any specific caste-distinction attributed to them, they
become entitled to all that characterises the *man*,—both as ‘sons’ and
as persons dealing with *Śrāddhas*. Specially as all men are equally
entitled to *making gifts*.

“But in the absence of further distinction, dealings with the man could
not proceed (merely on the basis of his belonging to the genus ‘man’);
for the simple reason that the genus ‘man’ is common to all human
beings.”

There is no force in this; every person has his own distinctive
appellation; every man is called either ‘Devadatta’ or ‘Yajñadatta.’
Then, if it be considered necessary to specify the particular
relationship of the persons in question,—well, they have such
appellations as ‘*Kānina*’ (‘maiden-born’),

‘*Sahoḍha*’ (‘taken with the mother’) and so forth.

“But all these names are found among all the four castes; so that they
also would be general (just like the genus ‘man’).”

In that case, they would be distinguished by the name of their
father—‘he is the *maiden-born son* of Devadatta,’ and so forth.

Thus there is no force in the argument based upon the difficulty of
distinguishing these sons.

All the laws that are formulated herb are with reference to all the four
castes; as is clear from what has been declared in 1.2 above. That is
why we have the plural number in the text, which refers to the four
castes, ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ and the rest. The persons here mentioned do not all
belong to any one caste; since the definition set forth is such as is
applicable to all castes. Just as the son born to a *Brāhmaṇa* from his
wedded *Brāhmaṇī* wife is a *Brāhmaṇa*, so is the son born to a Kṣatriya
and the other castes also, born of parents of the same caste, belong to
that same caste. Then again, there could be no ‘genus’ in the absence of
all particulars. *E.g*., in the absence of the *particular* trees,
*Śiṃśapā* and the rest, where could there be the *genus* ‘tree?’

The mixed castes are of two kinds—the product of marriages ‘in the
natural order,’ and the product of marriages of the ‘reverse order.’ Now
those of the former class take the mother’s caste; while the products of
marriages of the ‘reverse order’ have no duties save the most general
ones of ‘not injuring living beings’ and so forth (enumerated in 10.63).
All kinds of sons have been duly specified with their own distinctive
names, and yet even the name of the products of ‘reverse marriages’ is
not found mentioned.

“What are those *duties* to the performance whereof these people would
be entitled? Where too is the text that makes them so entitled? The
duties described here are not with reference to any particular caste;
the text—‘Of the mixed castes etc., etc.’ (1.2) clearly indicates that
what is described pertains to *all castes*.”

The answer to the above is as follows:—As regards the mention of the
general duties of ‘not injuring others’ and the rest, with reference to
*the four castes*, it is clearly meant to be applicable to *every human
being*.

Even though the text occurs in connection with sons born of ‘marriages
in the reverse order,’ yet its direct meaning bears upon *all men*. In
reality however it is more logical to take it as pertaining to such
castes as stand on the same footing as those born of ‘reverse
marriages,’ and it cannot stop short only at what is indicated by the
context This we shall explain under the text (10.63) itself.

Then again, we have the following declaration—‘All those born of
violation of the law are equal to Śūdras;’ (Manu 10.41),—where
‘violation of the law’ stands for ‘absence of sacramental rites;’ and
this is of eight kinds, as described under verse 24 below;—where
‘adultery’ stands for sexual intercourse with the wives of other men
belonging to one’s own caste; other matters relating to this matter we
shall explain later on.

Thus then it follows that, even though the sons born of such ‘violations
of the law’ do not belong to any caste, yet their title to the
performance of certain acts rests upon the direct declarations of the
texts.

*In the case of the* *Kṣatriya* *the child should be taken* *to belong
to* the mother’s caste; because there are texts indicative of this: In
connection with the ‘*Dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa*’ son a peculiar ceremony has been
prescribed (?); and in connection with other *Śrauta* rites also, we
find a distinct procedure laid down with reference to him (?)

From all this it follows that it is only the son belonging to the
*Brāhmaṇa* caste who is entitled to an equal share with his uncle; hence
it is that it is declared that ‘one should receive him legally.’ (?) All
this would not be well if the injunction were in the aforesaid form.
Because according to that‘he would be equal to the *Śūdra*;’ and as
property is meant for sacrificial performances (to which the *Śūdra* is
not entitled), how could he be entitled to any share of it?

As for the son ‘born of another man while the husband is alive,’ and
that ‘born of a widow,’ these are only ‘soil-born’ sons. Such is the
custom among all civilised men; *e.g*., Pāṇḍu, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Vidura,
all ‘soil-born’ sons, took the caste of their respective mothers.

Then again, the ‘outcast’ also has been excluded from being invited at
*Śrāddhas*; and yet as he would be beyond the pale of all morality,
there could be no possibility of any idea being entertained regarding
his admissibility \[so that the objector was not justified in drawing
any conclusions from the exclusion of the ‘soil-born’ sons from
*Śrāddhas* \],

As regards the text quoted above (from Yājñavalkya, 2.133),—since it is
a mere reference, it may be explained away somehow. Or we may take it as
referring to the ‘appointed’ son.

Then as regards the argument that “it is only what is well-known that
can serve as the *definition* (the distinguishing feature) of
anything”—we ask—Is not the meaning of the term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ already
known? In fact what the text does is to preclude the idea of
‘illegitimacy’ bang entertained regarding persons to whom die name
‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ is applied,—the sense being that they belong to the caste
of their parents. Nor can it be argued that this would lead to a
*regressus ad infinitum*; as the world has had no beginning in time.

It has been urged that what is here stated is illogical But this could
be so only if the matter of castes were something negotiable by direct
perception. As a matter of fact however it is something that can be
determined only with the help of *Smṛtis*, and as such must be as they
are declared to be in these texts. Just as in the case of such titles as
‘*Vaśiṣṭha*’ and the like (family-names), it is found that, even in the
absence of any blood-relationship with the personage named, they are
applied to men on the basis of uninterrupted tradition handed down from
times immemorial; and serve as the basis of such expressions as ‘the
Vaśiṣṭhas are listening.’ And the case of the castes also should be
taken as standing on the same footing. Just as in the case of a number
of Brāhmaṇas, all of whom are equally ‘Brāhmaṇas,’ they are classified
as ‘*Bhṛgus*,’ ‘*Vatsas*; ‘*Bhāradvājas*,’ and so forth—such distinction
being based entirely upon ‘*Smṛti*,’—so in the case of a number of
persons, all of whom are equally ‘men,’ they come to be distinguished as
‘*Brāhmaṇas*,’ ‘*Kṣatriyas*’ and so forth.

Some people have brought forward (against the view that Brāhmaṇas must
be born of duly wedded Brāhmaṇa couples) the case of Jābāla: Satyakāma
Jābāla asked his mother—To what *gotra* do I belong? She answered—I do
not know, as I obtained you while I was, during my youth, attending, as
a maid, upon several men. Having heard this, the boy went over to
Hāridrumata Gautama, and said—Revered Sir, I wish to reside with you as
a Religious Student. The sage asked him—To what *gotra* do you belong?
The boy answered—I asked my mother, and she told me that in her youth,
she obtained me etc., etc.;—whereupon Gautama concluding that no
non-Brāhmaṇa could speak so frankly, directed him to fetch fuel and
said—‘I shall initiate thee.’ What the mother meant was that in her
youth she met many men, and she knew not from whom the child was born;
and what Gautama did was to infer, from the boy’s truthfulness, that he
must have been begotten by a *Brāhmaṇa*, and hence he initiated him.
From this those people conclude that sons born to persons from such
women of the same caste *as are not duly wedded*, are also of the same
caste.

There is however no force in this. All that the mother’s statement means
is—‘I obtained you during my youth’—at a period of life when the mind is
fickle, being beset with fancies—‘when I was attending’—as a
maid-servant, suffering from hunger—‘wandering in several places’—not
living at any one place,—‘hence I have no recollection of the
*gotra-name* of my husband.’

From all this it becomes established that sons born to a person from a
duly wedded wife of the same caste as himself belong to the same caste.
And in the case of Jābāla also, Gautama inferred from the words of the
boy, that he must be the son of *Brāhmaṇa-* parents; hence though he
recognised him as a *Brāhmaṇa*, he did not know his *gotra*. What he
wished to ascertain by means of the question regarding the boy’s
*gotra*, was the special Vedic Rescension to which he belonged; and this
for the reason that the exact method of his initiation would vary with
the Rescension to which one belonged; while his *gotra* has no bearing
upon the initiation at all. And it is not, as some people have
explained, that “the question really referred to the boy’s *caste*, the
idea in the sage’s mind being that he would deduce the caste from the
nobility of his race, while a direct question about *caste* would be
impolite.”—(5)

‘*Ānulomyena*’.—‘In the direct order, *i.e*., by a Brāhmaṇa on a

bridegroom being always older than the bride” (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 511), which
explains the meaning to be that children born of a Brāhmaṇa couple are
Brāhmaṇa by caste; so also in the case of Kṣatriya couples and so
forth;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra 76a).
