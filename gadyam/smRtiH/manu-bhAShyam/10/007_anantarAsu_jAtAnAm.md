आद्येनार्धश्लोकेनोक्तम् अर्थम् अनुवदति, द्वितीयेन वक्ष्यमाणसंक्षेपः । **द्व्येकान्तरा** । द्व्यन्तरा ब्राह्मणस्य शूद्रा, एकान्तरा वैश्या । नातीव श्लोकः सप्रयोजनः ॥ १०.७ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The first half of the verse reiterates what has gone before; and the
second half contains a brief indication of what follows.

‘*Two or three degrees lower*.’—For the Brāhmaṇa, the wife ‘*three
degrees lower*’ would be the *Śūdra*; and the Vaiśya would be ‘*two
degrees lower*.’

There is not much useful purpose served by this verse.—(7)

“Regarding the term *Pāraśava*, see above, 9.178. Govindarāja and
Nārāyaṇa remark that the second name *Pāraśava* is added in order to
distinguish the *Niṣāda*, who is Pratiloma and subsists by catching
fish.”—Buhler.
