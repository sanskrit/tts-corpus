‘*Vyasana*’ is *suffering*;—the ‘*mūla*,’ of it is *killing*; what is
meant is that the livelihood of these men is the executing of criminals,
the carrying of the dead bodies of men dying without any relations, the
taking away of their clothes, eating the cakes offered to the dead, and
so forth.

This caste is born from the ‘*Caṇḍāla*’ on the ‘*Pukkasa*’ woman.

Or, ‘*mūla*’ may be taken as standing for the *roots* of trees, and the
‘*vyasana*’ would stand for the *dissecting* of these; and this forms
their livelihood. That is, they live by selling the roots and other
things extracted out of the trees that have been cut down.—(38)

‘*Mūlavyasanavṛttimān*’—‘Who lives by executing criminals.’ (Govindarāja
and Rāghavānanda);—‘who lives by digging roots for selling them as
medicines or for curing homorhoids (hemorrhoids?)’ (Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana).
