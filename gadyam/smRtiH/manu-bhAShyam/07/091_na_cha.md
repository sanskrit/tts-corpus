रथस्थेन रथारूढ एव हन्तव्यः, स्थलस्थितो न हन्तव्यः । **क्लीबो** नपुंसकः, पौरुषहीनो वा । अन्यत्र दृढ आसीन उपविष्टो रथपृष्ठे भूमौ वा । **तवास्मीति** वदति यस् तम् अपि न हन्यात् । शब्दनियमो ऽत्र न विवक्षितः । दीनं वदन्न् एवंजातीयकैर् अपि शब्दैः "त्वदीयो ऽहम्, त्वाम् आश्रितो ऽस्मि" इति न हन्तव्यः ॥ ७.९१ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The man on the chariot should strike only him who also is on a chariot;
so that one standing on the ground shall not be struck.

‘*Eunuch*’— who is devoid of masculinity; or who is without manliness.

‘*He who is seated*’—unconcerned, elsewhere; or on his chariot, or on
the ground.

He shall not strike also one who says ‘I am yours’. No stress is meant
to be laid upon the exact words to be used. What is meant is that he
shall not strike the poor supplicant who addresses to him such words as
‘I am yours’, ‘I seek your shelter’, and so forth (91)

‘*Sthalārūḍham*’—‘Who is standing on the other ground’ (Medhātithi,
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘one who, in flight, has climbed on an
eminence’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 406); and in
*Nītimayūkha* (p. 80).

**(verses 7.91-93)  
**

*Gautama* (10.18).—‘No sin is incurred in slaying foes in
battle,—excepting those who have lost their horses, charioteers or arms,
those who join their hands in supplication, those who flee with flying
hair, those who sit. down with averted faces, those who have climbed in
flight on eminences or trees, messengers, and those who declare
themselves to be cows, or Brāhmaṇas.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.18.11).—‘He shall not light those in fear, intoxicated,
insane or out of their minds; nor those who have lost their armour; nor
with women, infants, aged men and Brāhmaṇas.’

*Āpastamba* (2.10, 11).—‘The Āryas forbid the killing of those who have
laid down their arms, of those who beg for mercy with flying hair or
joined palms, and of fugitives.’

*Yajñavalkya* (1.325).—‘He shall mot strike one who says *I am yours*,
or who is terrified, or deprived of arms, or who is engaged with another
person, or who has turned hack from the fight, or one who is only
looking on the battle.’

*Devala* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti., p. 407).—‘Who is eating straw, who is
engaged with another, who is not actively engaged in fight, who is
seeking shelter, the imbecile, one pressed by another, the religious
student, the aged man, the outcast, the infant,—these shall not ho
struck in lawful battle, by soldiers, even in times of distress.’
