Those ‘*who act unlawfully*,’—*i.e*., do things harmful to the
King.—*i.e*., such persons as the Chief Minister and others,—it is the
punishment to be inflicted upon such men that is described now. As
regards persons who behave unlawfully towards one another, the
punishment to be inflicted is going to be described under VIII. 126,
where it is said—‘Having ascertained the motive &c &c.’; and the present
verse also we have explained under that text. One additional factor
introduced in the present text is ‘*learning*’, which stands for *Vedic
learning*.

‘*Appropriately*’—according as each man may deserve.

‘*Mete out*’—inflict, bestow.

Punishment should be meted out after having fully considered all that is
here mentioned. If inflicted in any other way, it would bring
perceptible trouble to the King.

The two (similar) verses occurring in discourses VII and VIII differ in
the following respects—(*a*) one refers to visible (worldly) matters and
the other to invisible (super-physical) ones, and (*b*) one refers to
the King’s servants and the other to his people.—(16)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākoì'a* (p. 646), which adds the
following notes:—*Rājā*, so called because of his *giving satisfaction
(rañjanāt*),—*puruṣaḥ*, ‘equal to the Supreme Being’, residing in the
hearts of the people;—he is the *netā*, the ‘leader’, the propagator of
*Dharma*,

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 292);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 261), which has the following notes:—*Rājā*, so
called because he keeps the people contented (),—*puruṣaḥ*, the Supreme
Person, because he abides in the heart (*puri shete*) of the
people,—*nètā*, - ruler, master,—‘*śāsitā*’, the propagator of proper
righteousness.

*Yājñavalkya* (1.352).—(See under l5.)

*Yājñavalkya* (1.367).—‘The king shall inflict punishment upon those who
deserve it, after duly taking into consideration, the crime, the place
and the time, as also the strength, age, act and wealth of the culprit,’

*Gautama* (12.51).—‘The award of punishment should be regulated by a
consideration of the status of the criminal, of his bodily strength, of
the nature of the crime and whether the offence has been repeated.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (19, 9-10).—‘Punishment should be awarded in cases of assault
and abuse after due consideration of the particular place and time, of
the duties, age, learning, and the sect; in accordance with the
scriptures and in accordance with precedents.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.91, 92).—‘He should inflict punishments, corresponding to the
nature of their offences, upon evil-doers. He should inflict punishments
according to justice.’

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 255).—‘The king should
inflict punishment after due enquiry; everything rests upon punishment.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 32).—‘Punishment is the means whereby the security of
the science of philosophy, Vedic triad and Trade-Agriculture is
obtained.’

*Śukranīti* 1.45-47).—‘Through fear of punishment meted out by the king,
each man gets into the habit of following his own Dharma. The person who
follows his own Dharma can become powerful and influential in this
world. With strict adherence to one’s own duty, there can he no
happiness. Poliowing one’s own Dharma is the highest penance.’
