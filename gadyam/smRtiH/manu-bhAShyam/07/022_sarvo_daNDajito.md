It is by punishment that all people are kept under control; for an absolutely guileless man is hard to find; it is through fear of punishment that the world subserves the experiences (of men).—(22).

स्वभावेनैव प्रकृत्यैव **शुचिः** शुद्धो धर्मार्थकामेषु, स तादृशो **नरो** **दुर्लभः**, दुःखैर् लब्धुं शक्यः । किं तु **दण्डजितो** दण्डेन जीयते, पथि स्थाप्यते । तद्भ्यान् न यथाकामं प्रवर्तते । **जगद् भोगायेति** प्राग् उक्तम् एव (म्ध् ७.१५) ॥ ७.२२ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

A man who, by his very nature, is ‘*guileless*’, in matters relating to
duty, wealth and pleasures, is ‘*hard to find*,’ can be met with
difficulty. In fact, it is ‘*by punishment*’ that a man is ‘*kept under
control*’, kept firm in the right path; through fear of it, he does not
give free vent to his desires.

‘*The world subserves etc*.’—This has been already explained (under
15).—(22)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 286), which adds
the explanation that it is difficult to have any one pure by his very
nature; in most cases it is only through fear of punishment that people
are kept on the right path.—It is quoted again on p. 292;—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 263).

प्रायण **सर्वो दण्डजित** एव **लोकः**, येन **दुर्लभः** स्वभावशुद्धः, शासनानुवर्ती । तद् एतद् दण्डपातनं यद्य् अपि दुःखोत्पादनं तथापि प्रकल्प्यते शास्त्रेण, येनान्य उपायो धर्मस्थितेर् नास्तीति ॥ ७.२२ ॥

022	The whole world is kept in order by punishment, for a guiltless man is hard to find; through fear of punishment the whole world yields the enjoyments (which it owes).
