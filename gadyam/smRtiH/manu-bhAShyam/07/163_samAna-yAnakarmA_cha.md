But the King shall know that Alliance and War are of two kinds; so also both Marching and Halting; and Seeking shelter also has been declared to be of two kinds.—(162)


Alliance, endowed with future possibilities, is of two kinds—(1) that in which the act of marching is undertaken in common and (2) that; in which it is otherwise.—(163)

**समानयानकर्मा** । "यानफलं सहितौ तुल्यौ गच्छावः समानफलभागितया, न च त्वयाहम् उल्लङ्घनीयः । यत् ततो लप्स्यते तत् तव मम च भविषति" । अथ वा "त्वम् अन्यतो याहि, अहम् अन्यत्र यास्यामि" इत्य् एवम् असमानयानकर्मा **विपरीतः** ॥ ७.१६३ ॥

**(verses 7.162-163)**

\(1\) ‘*That in which the act of marching is undertaken in common*’,—in
which the agreement entered into is in the following form:—‘Let us march
at the goal conjointly, having equal shares in it, and I shall not be
passed over by you; whatever we gain shall belong to both of us’:—(2) Or
that ‘You march one way, I go the other’; where the action is not joint,
it is ‘*otherwise*’—(162-163)

**(verse 7.162)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 325), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Sandhi*,’ ‘alliance’, is of two kinds—(1) the
compact that ‘both of us should march against a common enemy’, and (2)
the compact that ‘you march this way, I march the other way’;—‘War’ also
is of two kinds—(1) declared by one’s self against an enemy, and (2)
undertaken for helping an ally attacked by an enemy;—‘Marching’ also is
of two kinds—(1) singly, and (2) conjointly with an ally; ‘Halting’ also
is of two kinds—(1) done on account of weakness and (2) done for the
purpose of waiting to help an ally;—‘Division of forces’ is of two
kinds—(1) the king remaining with half the force in the fort and the
Commander-in-chief going out to meet the enemy and (2) the reverse
arrangement;—‘Seeking protection’ also is of two kinds—(1) done for the
rescuing of what has been lost and (2) done for awaiting future
aggression.

**(verse 7.163)**

Nārāyaṇa and Nandana take the term ‘*tadā tvāyatisaṃyuktaḥ*’ as
referring to two different cases,—‘yielding either (*a*) immediate, or
(*b*) future advantages.’

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 325) to the effect
that the two kinds of ‘alliance’ spoken of above (see preceding note)
are each again of two kinds, as leading to (*a*) immediate advantage or
(*b*) future advantage.

**(verse 7.162)**

*Kāmandaka* (4.68, 74).—‘The King should form alliance with a person,
illustrious, well-spoken, benevolent, learned, even-minded, having
numerous partisans and expected to remain constant in faithfulness at
all times. Friends are of four kinds—derived from birth, relationship,
ancestral obligations and protection from danger.’

**(verse 7.163)**

*Kāmandaka* (9.5, etc.).—‘Peace concluded between two parties of equal
resources is called *Kapāla-sandhi*. The peace concluded through the
offer of presents is called *Upahāra*. *Santāna-sandhi* is that
concluded by the king by giving his daughter in marriage to his royal
adversary. That peace is called *Saṅgata-sandhi* which is founded on
friendship; this is also called *Kāñcana*. Peace that is concluded with
a view to putting a stop to all outstanding controversies has been named

*Upanyāsa*. “If I do him good, he will do the same to me.”—Peace
concluded under this consideration is called *Pratīkāra-sandhi*. When
two parties join one another for the accomplishing of common interests
and, if they enjoy mutual confidence,—this peace is called *Samyoga*,
etc.

163	An alliance which yields present and future advantages, one must know to be of two descriptions, (viz.) that when one marches together (with an ally) and the contrary (when the allies act separately).
