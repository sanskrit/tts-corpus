**आप्तदक्षिणैर्** भूरिदक्षिणैः पौण्डरीकादिभिः । **भोगान् धनानि च** । वस्त्रगन्धविलेपनादयो भोजनविशेषाश् च भोगाः । धनानि सुवर्णादीनि । नित्यम् एव तद्दानम् इच्छन्ति । **धर्मार्थं** तस्योत्पत्त्यर्थम् एव ॥ ७.७९ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*At which large sacrificial fees are paid*’—*i.e*., the *Pauṇḍarīka*
and other elaborate sacrifices.

‘*Luxuries and riches*’.—Clothes, scents, unguents, and rich food
constitute the ‘luxuries’; and ‘*riches*’ consist in silver and gold.

Some people hold that these gifts are obligatory, and not voluntary.
This is what is meant by the assertion that this is ‘for the purpose of
acquiring merit’.—(79).
