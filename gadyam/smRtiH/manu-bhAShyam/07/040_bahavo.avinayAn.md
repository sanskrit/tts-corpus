Many Kings, along with their belongings, have perished through want of discipline; while, on account of discipline, many, even though living in forests, have obtained Kingdoms.—(40).

पूर्वोक्त एवार्थः श्लोकत्रयेणैव दृढीक्रियते । अविनीताः **सपरिग्रहा नष्टाः** । पुत्रदारहस्त्यश्वादिसंपत् **परिग्रहः** । ये तु विनयिनः, न ते राष्ट्रं प्राप्य हारयन्ति । यावत् ते दूरस्था **वनस्था अपि,** कोशहीना अपि, राज्यं **प्रतिपेदिरे** लब्धवन्तः ॥ ७.४० ॥

What has been stated above is further emphasised by means of the next
three verses.

Undisciplined kings, have perished ‘*along with their belongings*’.
‘*Belongings*’ stand for the son, wife, elephants, horses and so forth.

On the other hand, those who are disciplined never lose their kingdom,
after having got it; in fact even when living far off in the forest, and
hence devoid of any treasure &c., they have obtained kingdoms.’—(40).
