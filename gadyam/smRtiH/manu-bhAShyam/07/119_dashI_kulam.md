<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Daśi*’ is the person in charge of Ten villages; so ‘*Viṃśi*’ also. The
forms of the words are Vedic.

‘*Kula*’—part of a village; known in some places as ‘*haṭṭa*’ and in
others as ‘*uṣṭa*’.

Five times this land appertains to the Lord of Ten villages; and an
entire village to the Lord of Hundred villages; and the ‘*Town*’—city,
to the Lord of a Thousand villages. The system is that the living should
be determined in accordance with the position and duties of the
officers.—(119)

‘*Kulam*’—‘A portion of the village, known in some places as *ghaṭṭa*,
and in others as ‘*uṣṭa*’;—‘as much land as can be cultivated with two
ploughs’ (Kullūka);—‘as much as is cultivated by one cultivator’
(Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 251), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Kulam*’ is a portion of the village, called
‘*pādukā*,’ says *Kalpataru*:—others however hold that it stands for as
much land as can be cultivated by two ploughs. That much of land he
should have for his livelihood.
