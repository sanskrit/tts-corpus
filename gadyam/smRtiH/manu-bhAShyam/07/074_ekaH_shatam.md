A single bow-man, standing on a rampart, can fight against a hundred; and a hundred can fight against ten thousand; it is for the season that fortification has been enjoined.—(74).

सुप्रसिद्धम् एतद् दुर्गप्रयोजनम् । 

- <u>प्राकारदृष्टान्तेन</u> गिरिदुर्गबलम् एतद् इति । 

- <u>तद् अयुक्तम्</u>, महीदुर्गे ऽपि प्राकारसंभवात् । तस्मात् सर्वेषां दुर्गाणां तत्प्रयोजनं स्वबुद्ध्या रूप्यते ॥ ७.७४ ॥

This use of the fort is well known.

Some people have held that the example of the ‘rampart’ indicates that
this refers to the ‘hill-fort’. But this is not right; because ramparts
are possible in ‘earthen forts’ also. Hence the use here described must
refer to all kinds of forts.—(71)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 202);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Lakṣaṇa, p. 238);—in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 65), which says
that even if the attack is made by men ten times the number of the
garrison, they are repulsed;—and in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 20a).

074	One bowman, placed on a rampart, is a match in battle for one hundred (foes), one hundred for ten thousand; hence it is prescribed (in the Sastras that a king will posses) a fortress.
