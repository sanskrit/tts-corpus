‘*These*’—Indra and the other chief Gods;—‘*with the constituent
elements*’—with the particles of their Light constituting their
bodies;—*The ‘King was created*’;—hence his face becomes terrible to
look at;—‘*by his glory*’—on account of his glory.’

He was created after ‘*taking out*’ the essential constituents. The root
‘*kṛṣi*’ (in the term ‘*niṣkṛṣya*’ (in verse 4) denotes ‘*creating*’.
The Ablative (in ‘*mātrābhyaḥ*’) may be explained either on the ground
of the ‘elements’ being the permanent factor out of which the
constituents of the King are taken out. Or we may read ‘*mātrāya*’ with
the Instrumental ending (which would denote cause).—(5)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—again in the
same work (Vyavahāra, p. 5);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 16),
which adds the following notes:—‘*Eṣām surendrāṇām*’—‘these principal
gods, Indra and the rest’;—‘*mātrābhyaḥ*’—‘the king has been created
after extracting the most essential portions out of the constituent
portions of the said deities; for this reason in glory, he surpasses all
beings, *i.e*., he is superior to all things.’
