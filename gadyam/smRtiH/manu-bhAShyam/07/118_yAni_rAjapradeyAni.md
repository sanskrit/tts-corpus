This lays down the means of subsistence for the Village-lord.
‘*Village-lord*’—the officer in charge of one village,—‘*shall
get*’—obtain—‘those things’ for his subsistence, which ‘*ought to be
furnished to the King by the villagers*.’

‘*Food etc*.’—*i*.*e*., the sixth or eighth part of the corn
produced;—as is going to be prescribed under 10.120 *etc*.—(118)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 250), which
explains the meaning to be that the ‘lord of the village’ should receive
for his living only the food, drink and fuel and such other things as
are due to be presented to the king,—and not the annual rent;—this
annual rent being realised by the king himself through a trusted
official.

*Mahābhārata* (2.87.6).—‘The lord of the village shall take all the
eatables that may be produced in the village he shall maintain the lord
of ten villages who, in his turn, shall maintain the lord of a hundred
villages.’

*Śukranīti* (1.631-635).—‘The heads of villages are to receive
one-twelfth of the income from the village, the army

is to be maintained by three such parts, charity with half such part,
entertainment of the people with that same part; officers are to he paid
out of half such part; and personal expenditure is to he met with half
that part; the balance to go to swell the State Treasury.’

*Mahābhārata* (12.87.6-8).—‘The Lord of hundred villages shall enjoy one
village, which is large, prosperous and well-populated. The Lord of a
thousand villages enjoys a *Śākhā-nagara*, a sub-city.’
