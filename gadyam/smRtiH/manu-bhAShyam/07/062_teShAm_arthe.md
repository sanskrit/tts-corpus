‘*Arthe*’, ‘*work relating to finance*’,—*i.e*., offices prataining
(pertaining?) to income and expenditure. In these he shall employ those
who are ‘*honest*’—not covetous of wealth.

Some of these financial offices are indicated by example ‘*mines and
stores*’;—‘*mines*’ are places where gold, silver and other precious
metals are dug out and cleansed, and ‘*stores*’ consist of food-grains,
cotton, seeds and so forth.

‘*In the inferior of the palace*’;—*i.e*., the inner apartments, the
kitchen, the bed-room and the ladies’ apartments.—In these he shall
appoint ‘*timid*’ persons. Because brave persons, if won over by his
enemies, might kill the king, when he may be alone.

All of these should be ‘*expert*’; they are energetic and, not minding
any opposition, never allow their master’s work to suffer.—(62)

‘*Karmānta*’—‘*Bhakṣya-kārpāsāvāpādayaḥ*’, ‘Food stuffs, cotton fabrics,
utensils and so forth’ or ‘sowing of seeds of food-grains and cotton
etc.’ (Medhātithi, to whom Buhler, on the strength of his own Mss.,
attributes the explanation ‘sugar-mills, distilleries and so
forth’);—‘store-houses of sugarcane, grains and such things’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 187), which adds
the following notes:—*Teṣām*, ‘from among the said
assistants’;—‘*arthe*,’ ‘in the work of collecting revenue’; which is
further explained by the term ‘*ūkarakarmānta*’;—‘*bhīrūn*’, ‘those who
are full of fear of this world as well as of the next’

It is also quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 581);—and in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 53),
which explains ‘*ākara*’ as ‘mines of gold and other
metals’,—‘*karmānta*’ as ‘*granaries*’,—and ‘*antarniveśana*’ as ‘the
bed-room and other private apartments,’ and adds that there should be
‘*bhīru*’, cowards, as brave men might kill the king.

062	Among them let him employ the brave, the skilful, the high-born, and the honest in (offices for the collection of) revenue, (e.g.) in mines, manufactures, and storehouses, (but) the timid in the interior of his palace.
