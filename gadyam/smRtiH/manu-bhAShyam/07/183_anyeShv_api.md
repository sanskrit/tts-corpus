At other times also, if he perceives certain victory, then he shall pick up a quarrel and march forward; also when some trouble has arisen for the enemy.—(183)

Even apart from the seasons mentioned in the preceding verse, ‘*at other
times*’— during the rains and other seasons also,—if he thinks that his
victory is ‘*certain*’—sure to come—then ‘*he shall march forward*’—if
he has a strong force, during the rains,—has his elephants and horses in
full strength, then, by virtue of the strength of his forces, his
victory is certain.

‘*Trouble*’ for the enemy, in connection with his army and treasury &c.;
when such trouble has arisen, then he may march against him, even
irrespectively of the condition of his own forces; since the army,
suffering from its own internal troubles, becomes easily reducible; in
fact he perishes, even like a log of wood which perishes by the mere
touch of.........(?).

‘*He shall pick up a quarrel*’;—he must march forward; after having
attacked and challenged the enemy he shall advance, when he knows the
other party is in great trouble.—(183)

*Cf*. Kāmandaka, 11.3.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 401);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 330), to the effect that the ‘enemy’s
difficulty’ being itself laid down as affording the best opportunity for
marching against him, there is no room for any other consideration;—and
in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 742) to the same effect.
