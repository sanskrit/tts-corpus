The non-giving of what should he given to the new king, or to any other
person, is ‘*productive of displeasure*’; it causes displeasure; and the
giving of it is ‘*productive of pleasure*’. Both these facts are well
known;—that the giving of what is desired causes pleasure, and the
witholding of it causes pain.

^(‘)*Each is commended when done at the proper time*’;—at one time any
gift however small causes pleasure, while at another time a poor gift,
or a small one, causes no pleasure at all. Hence the seizing and giving
away of property should be done after full consideration of the
peculiarity of the time,—(204).

All that has gone before and what is going to be described below,—all
this is ‘dependent’ &c. &c. (says the next verse.)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya*, (Rājanīti, p. 410), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Abhīpsitānām*,’ ‘required by, the king selected
from among the family of the late king, and by his
ministers,’—‘*arthānām*,’ ‘of things,’—‘*ādānam*,’ ‘the taking
away,’—which is ‘*apriyakaram*,’—‘disagreeable,’—and ‘*dānam*’, ‘giving
away’—which is ‘*priyakārakam*’ to them;—in as much as it is only if he
were fully equipped with the necessary elephants, horses and wealth that
the new king could hope to be safe against other kings, the presentation
of such things at the time of installation is ‘*kāle yuktam*,’ ‘highly
opportune,’—and hence ‘*praśasyate*,’ ‘is commended.’

204	The seizure of desirable property which causes displeasure, and its distribution which causes pleasure, are both recommendable, (if they are) resorted to at the proper time.
