उपरोधस् तथा कर्तव्यो यथा न कश्चिन् निष्क्रामति किंचित् प्रविशति । **राष्ट्रं** दुर्गाद् बहिर् देशः । तस्योपपीडनं स्वदेशापवाहोपमर्द्दनादिभिः । **यवसा**दीनां दूषणं विनाशनम्, असद्द्रव्यमिश्रणादिभिः ॥ ७.१९५ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The siege has to be laid in such a manner that no one is allowed to
enter nor any one allowed to get out

‘*Kingdom*’—*i.e*. territories outside the fortress occupied by the
enemy.—This shall be ‘*harassed*’;—by kidnapping the inhabitants and
persecuting them in various ways.

The ‘*vitiating*’ of fodder etc. consists in spoiling them by mixing
undesirable things with them.—(195).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.342), in support of the view
that before a country has been entirely subjected, the conqueror should
do nothing for the sake of the people of that country;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 402);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p.
403).
