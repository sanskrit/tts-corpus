‘*Disgraced*’,—fallen from honour. Such despicable persons, as also
other paltry men, even when not disgraced, might hear something, and
might be able to utter a few syllables; and this would lead to the
disclosure of the secret; as, from the slightest hints, clever men are
capable of drawing important inferences.—(150)
