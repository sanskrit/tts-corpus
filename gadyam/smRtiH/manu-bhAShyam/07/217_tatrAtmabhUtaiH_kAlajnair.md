There he shall eat the food that has been thoroughly tested by such servants as are his own very self, as are conversant with the peculiarities of time, and are uncorruptible,—with such sacred texts as are destructive of poison,—(217)

‘*There*’—in the inner apartment.

‘*Who are his own very self*’,—*i.e*. who are as watchful of his safety
as he himself would be.

‘*Who are conversant with the peculiarities of time*’— who know what
food and drink to give at what age and under what conditions.

‘*Uncorruptible*’— who cannot be alienated; thoroughly trustworthy.

‘*Servants*’—physicians and others.

The food shall be first ‘*tested*’—*i.e*. tasted by them; and then he
shall eat it.

The ‘testing’ shall be done by expert physicians by means of fire, the
partridge and such other things. If poison has been mixed with the food,
it becomes discolored upon drying, which shows its impurity; and when
poisoned food is thrown into the fire, it loses its odour, or becomes
too sour; there is a discolouring in the flame of the fire also; and if
birds are given the food, they suffer in various ways; e.g. the *Kokila*
dies at the mere sight of poisoned food; the *Jīvaka* becomes withered,
by merely looking at poison; the eyes of the *Chakora* (partridge)
become destroyed,—and the *Muṣka* (?) begins to perspire.

He shall also repeat over suspected food those sacred texts that are
believed to be destructive of poisons.—(217)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 160).

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 161).—‘He shall touch no
food or bed or clothes or ornament until it has been tested.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.85).—‘He shall not taste any food that has not been tried
before.’

*Kāmandaka* (7.9).—‘The King should always be careful regarding his
conveyances, beds, seats, drinks, eatables, garments and ornaments and
everything else. He should shun these, even if the slightest suspicion
of their being poisoned is present.’

Do. (7.11, *et. seq*.).—‘*Bhṛṅgarāja*, *Śuka* and *Sārikā* emit
distressful notes at the sight of a venomous serpent. At the sight of
poison, the eyes of the *Chakora* lose their natural hue; the *Krauñca*
is visibly intoxicated; and the *Kokila*, becoming mad, perishes. At the
sight of poison, a feeling of languor always takes possession of
creatures.’

Examining, by means of one of those methods, his eatables, the King
shall eat them.

In order to test the rice offered to him, the king shall at first throw
some of it on fire, and then some to the birds and watch the effects. If
there is poison in the rice the flame and fumes will assume a blue
colour and there will be crackling sounds; and the birds eating the rice
will die. Curry contaminated with poison soon becomes juiceless and
vapid; when decocted, it yields blue spume, and then its flavour, etc.,
are destroyed; etc., etc., etc.’

*Śukranīti* (1.653-657).—‘For fear of poisons the king should examine
his food through monkeys and cocks. At the very sight of poisoned food,
drakes begin to limp, bees to hum, peacocks to dance, cocks to crow,
cranes to get intoxicated, monkeys to pass stools, rats to become
excited, birds to vomit. Thus is the food to be examined.’

217	There he may eat food, (which has been prepared) by faithful, incorruptible (servants) who know the (proper) time (for dining), which has been well examined (and hallowed) by sacred texts that destroy poison.
