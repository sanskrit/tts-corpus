पूर्वोकयोर् अप्रमादयोर् अन्यथात्वे दोषम् आह । यदि सम्यग् गुल्मस्थानानि प्रति न जागर्ति तदा छिद्रान्वेषिभिर् **दस्युभिः** चोरैः **प्रजा ह्रियन्ते** । तासु किं करिष्यति । अतस् तादृशो राजा **मृत** एव । जीवितं मरणम् एव । अतो ऽप्रमत्तेन भवितव्यम् । **विक्रोशन्त्यः** आक्रन्दन्त्यः । **ह्रियन्ते** संपश्यतः **सभृत्यस्य** निर्दिष्टं द्रक्ष्यते । केवलं च भृत्यास् तदीयाः पश्यन्ति नानुधावन्ति मोक्षयन्ति । सर्वे ते मृतकल्पाः ॥ ७.१४३ ॥

This text describes the evil arising from neglecting the watchfulness
laid down in the preceding verse.

If the king is not awake to the necessity of establishing outposts, then
his subjects are carried off by robbers, who are ever on the look out
for such loopholes; and what can the King do for the subjects? Such a
King would be as good as dead. His very living is death itself. For this
reason the King should be ever watchful.

‘*Screaming*’— crying —‘*are carried away*’;—‘*while, along with his
servants the King is looking on*.’ The evil is bound, under the
circumstances, to be simply looked upon helplessly; the King’s servants
can only look on, they cannot chase the robbers and free the people from
their clutches; all these are as good as dead.

‘*sampaśyataḥ*’ denotes *disregard*.

*Mahābhārata* (13.61.31).—‘A king in whose kingdom women are taken away
by force, while their husbands and sons are crying for help, is really
dead; he is not alive.’

*Āpastamba* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 294).—‘That king is said to he the
ordainer of security in whose kingdom there is no fear of thieves,
either in villages or in forests.’

*Hārīta* (Do.).—‘If wicked robbers prosper in the kingdom of a king, the
sin being very much enhanced cuts off the very roots of that king.’
