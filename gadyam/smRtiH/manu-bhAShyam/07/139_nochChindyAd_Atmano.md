The ‘cutting off of his own root’ consists in not realising taxes and
duties; and excessive taxation constitutes the ‘cutting off of the root
of others’; and as a matter of course, the latter is due to excessive
greed; and this is what is reiterated in the text.

The ‘cutting off of his own root’ causes Suffering to the King himself,
by the depletion of his treasury. From the same cause others also come
to suffer. For if a war were to break out, and the King’s finances
happened to be low, his defeat and destruc tion would be certain; and
this would constitute a great suffering for the people.

On the other hand, if the King were to realise taxes at all times of the
year, this also makes the people wretched.—(139)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodayā* (Rājanīti, p. 275), which
explains ‘*ātmamūloccheda*’ as ‘not realising revenues and taxes,’ and
‘*paramuloccheda*’ as ‘realising more revenue and taxes than what is
proper.’

*Mahābhārata* (12.87.18).—‘Taxes therefore shall be levied by the king
after proper investigation; he should not destroy his own as well as
other people’s roots by too much greed.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.338-339).—‘The king, who unlawfully adds to his
treasury out of the kingdom, speedily perishes along with his relations,
losing all his prosperity. The fire arising out of the heat produced by
harassing the people, is extinguished only after having burnt the king’s
prosperity, family and life.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 276).—‘The king who unlawfully
realises from the kingdom, taxes, fines, duties and shares of the land’s
produce, is a sinner.’

139	Let him not cut up his own root (by levying no taxes), nor the root of other (men) by excessive greed; for by cutting up his own root (or theirs), he makes himself or them wretched.
