This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 410);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 159) as laying down the time for holding
the Council;—and again on p. 317).

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 39).—‘He shall have recourse to only such pleasure as
is in consonance with spiritual and material welfare; he shall not
deprive himself of pleasure entirely; or he may devote equal attention
to all the three; as over-addiction to any one of them ruins the other,
etc. Material Welfare is the most important, says Kauṭilya; Spiritual
Welfare and Pleasure are dependent upon that.’
