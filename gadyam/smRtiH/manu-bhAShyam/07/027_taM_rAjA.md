The King who metes out punishment in the proper manner prospers in respect of his three aims; he who is blinded by affection, unfair, or mean is destroyed by that same punishment.—(27).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Blinded by affection*’—he who is unduly influenced by love.

‘*Unfair*’— inclined to be irascible. The King prospers if he metes out
punishment on a friend or a foe in the same impartial spirit.

‘*Mean*’—inclined to take undue advantage.

‘*Is destroyed by that same punishment*’— either through evil passions
aroused among the people, or through some imperceptible effects.—(27).

‘*Viṣamaḥ*’—‘Irascible’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘partial’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 647), which explains
‘*samyak*’ as ‘with due deliberation,’—‘*kāmātmā*’ as ‘one who acts just
as he pleases’—and ‘*Viṣamaḥ*’ as ‘adopting the wrong course by reason
of partiality;’—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*’ (p. 262), which explains
‘*Kāmātmā*’ as ‘if the king acts as he pleases,’ and ‘*Viṣamaḥ*’ as
‘acting wrongly through partiality or prejudice.’

*Kāmandaka* (2.41).—‘A king, by the right inflicting of punishments,
upholds this stayless world.’

*Kāmandaka* (1.11-13).—‘A righteous king protecting his subjects to the
best of his resources and having the power of capturing hostile cities,
should be held in as high a regard as the god Prajāpati himself. A
sovereign discharging his duties according to the rules of polity soon
secures the three ends for himself and for his people; acting otherwise,
he is sure to ruin himself and his people.’

Do. (2.36).—‘Tho self-controlled king holds the key to the spiritual and
material advancement of himself and bis people; therefore he should mete
out punishments impartially.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.354-356).—(See under 19.)

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 32).—‘The Teachers have declared that for the king
there is no other means save punishment for the subjugating of living
beings. Such is not the view of kauṭilya; for if a king is very severe
in his punishments, the people become discontented; if he is very
lenient, he is disregarded; he is respected only when he inflicts
punishment impartially in the right manner. If intelligently
administered, punishment brings prosperity and happiness to the people;
if improperly administered, through ignorance, or greed, or anger, it
angers even Hermits and Renunciates; what to say of Householders? The
people consisting of the four castes and orders is protected by the king
through punishment.’

027	A king who properly inflicts (punishment), prospers with respect to (those) three (means of happiness); but he who is voluptuous, partial, and deceitful will be destroyed, even through the (unjust) punishment (which he inflicts).
