is no disturbance; and when Force is employed, everything becomes
accomplished.—(109)

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 279).—‘Conciliation,
dissension, gifts, force, ignoring, guile and magic are the seven
expedients. Conciliation is of two kinds—real and unreal; of these the
unreal tends only to censure from all good men; the good man is always
tractable by conciliation; so also men of noble families, honest men and
righteous persons, and those who have control over their senses; towards
those the king shall never employ the *unreal* form of conciliation.
Real conciliation consists in describing the noble family and character
of the other party, and also the benefits that have been received from
him...... Towards the wicked conciliation is to be avoided, as they
misunderstand it as arising from fear.’

*Agni-purāṇa* (Do., p. 280).—‘Conciliation is of four kinds:—describing
the benefits conferred by the other party, pointing out the mutual bonds
of relationship, sweet speech, and describing future possibilities.’
