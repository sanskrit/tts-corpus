The Ambassador brings about the alliance of kings, and also disunites
those already allied. He does the former by saying even such agreeable
things as he has not been commissioned to say; and the latter by
describing even such unfriendly acts as may not have been done; by not
paying the presents of gold and other things that he may have brought
with him.

In this way be disunites allies.

This business, just spoken of, is transacted by the Ambassador, and by
it kings become disunited.

It is only persons with disagreeable speech that do this—(66)

Another work of the Ambassador is next described:—
