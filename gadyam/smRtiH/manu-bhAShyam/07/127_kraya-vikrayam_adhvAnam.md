Now follows the system of realising duties.

At what price the merchandise has been bought—what price it will fetch
when sold—what time it will take in selling—what deterioration, if any,
it is likely to suffer—the consideration of all this constitutes the
‘*investigation of the details of buying and selling*’.

‘*Journey*’—whether it takes much or little time to obtain it.

‘*Fooding*’—Flour, Rice &c.

‘*Accessories*’—*e.g*. butter, pulse, vegetables; as also fuel and such
things.

‘*Measures of safety*’—*i.e*. when passing through forests whether or
not things were secure against molestation by kings and robbers.

Having duly investigated all these, the King shall realise duties from
the traders.

The right reading is ‘*vaṇigbhir dāpayet karān*’; because according to
the *sūtra* ‘*gatibuddhi* &c.’ (Panini), there is nothing to justify the
Accusative case in ‘*vaṇijaḥ*,’ Or, the root in ‘*dāpayet*’ may mean
‘fine’, and hence like the root ‘*daṇḍī*’, it may take two objects
(which would justify the said Accusative ending).—(127)

‘*Yoyakṣemam*’—‘Charges incurred for security of property against
royalty and thieves and robbers’ (Medhātithi);—‘net profits (*yoga*) and
charges for securing the goods against robbers &c.’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 259), which adds
the following notes:—What has been paid for the cloth, salt and other
articles of merchandise? What are likely to be the profits from selling
them? From what distance has all this been brought? What quantity of
food and vegetables and condiments have been spent by the man in
importing the goods? How much he has lost over the charges incurred in
securing his goods against robbers and other dangers of the journey?
What is the profit he is actually making? What is he spending over the
guarding of his merchandise against robbers and thieves?—the King should
take into consideration all this and then fix the taxes payable by the
traders.

This verse is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 404).

*Mahābhārata* (12.87.13-14).—(Same as Manu, but reading ‘*Kūrayet*’ for
‘*dāpayet*.’)

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 241).—‘The officer in charge of the department of
trade shall keep himself informed of the demand, or absence of demand,
for commodities produced from land and water; those imported by land and
water; and also the relative prices of these; and the time for their
sale and export. He shall fix the prices.’

Do. (p. 270).—‘He shall fix the customs and duties payable on exports
and imports.’
