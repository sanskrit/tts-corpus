By all means in his power he shall take shelter in a ‘hilly fort’; because among all these (forts) the hilly fort is distinguished by many good qualities.—(71).


The first three of these are inhabited by deer, by animals living underground and by aquatic animals, and the last three by monkeys, men and gods.—(72).

**(verses 7.71-72)**

‘*The first three*’—the ‘bow-fort’ and the rest.

‘*Inhabited*’— taken shelter in.

‘*Animals living underground*’— the *gargara* (a kind of fish,) the
mungoose and the like.

‘*Aquatic animals*’—alligators, tortoise and so forth.

This means that the King suffers the good and bad effects that are
suffered by the animals inhabiting these places of shelter.

‘*The last three*’—‘*Plavaṅgama*’ is the monkey.—(72)

**(verse 7.71)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 203), which
explains ‘*bāhuguṇyena*’ as ‘by reason of its having many apparent
advantages, such as inaccessibility and so forth’;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Saṃskāra p. 72a);—and in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 65), which says that the
genitive in ‘*eteṣam*’ (which is its reading for ‘*eṣām hi*)’ denotes
*selection*.

**(verse 7.72)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 202), which adds
the following explanations:—From among the first three kinds of fort,
wild animals take shelter in the fort consisting of the desert,—‘animals
living in holes,’ *i.e*., rats take shelter in the fort consisting of
the ground, fish take shelter in the ‘fort’ consisting of unfordable
water;—monkeys take shelter in trees, which constitute their ‘fort’;—and
man takes shelter under men, who constitute his ‘fort’,—and the gods
take shelter on mountain-peaks, like the Kailāśa. What is meant is that
‘just as the gods and others take shelter under the defences of the
Kailasha peak and so forth, so should the king take shelter in a fort.

**(verse 7.71)**

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 203).—‘Of all forts, the
*Hilly fort* is the most highly commended.’

*Mahābhārata* (Do., p. 201).—‘Among the six kinds of forts laid down in
the scriptures, it is the *Human fort* that is the most inaccessible.’

*Śukranīti* (1.766).—‘The king should take shelter in hill forts in
times of great danger.’

Do. (4. 5, 2 *et seq*.).—‘Forts are made inaccessible by ditches,
thorns, rocks and deserts. The fort surrounded by ditches is called
*Parikhā*; that by walls of stone and bricks, *Parigha*; that by trees,
thorns and thickets *Vanadurga*; that near which there is no water is
called *Dhanvadurga*; that surrounded by large sheets of water is called
*Jaladurga*; that situated on high ground and supplied with plenty of
water is called *Giridurga*; that guarded by heroes versed in military
tactics is called *Sainyadurga*; that belonging to allies and relations
is the *Sahāyadurga*. The Sahāyadurga and the Sainyadurga arc the best
of all.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 204).—‘It should be equipped
with fuel, flavouring substances, canes, fodder, conveyances, machines
and weapons, and also well-disposed and brave soldiers. The king shall
also bring together, and provide livings for Brāhmaṇas learned in Vedic
lore and Kṣatriyas, also performers of Agṇihotra.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Do.).—‘Each one of these forts shall be supplied
with treasure and provisions, with elephants, horses and chariots,—also
with gems; it shall he fully supplied with machines, abounding in Vedic
learning, and equipped with all materials of war, well-stored with food
and money, supplied with drinks and water, fully supplied with
elephants, horses, chariots, cows, physicians and astrologers; also with
clarified butter, oils and medicines and other accessories; protected by
walls, ditches, towers and turrets.’

*Mahābhārata*—Śāntiparva (Parāśaramādhava Ācāra, p. 407).—‘Protected by
strong walls and ditches, supplied with elephants, horses and chariots,
with bright citizens, adorned with squares and markets, full of brave
and wise men.’
