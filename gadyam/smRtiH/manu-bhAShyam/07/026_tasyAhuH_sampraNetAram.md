The justness of the governor consists in the following qualities—(*a*)
truthfulness, (*b*) the habit of doing things after due consideration,
(*c*) wisdom and (*d*) a true discernment of the three aims of man.

‘*Truthful of speech*’—*he* who, having inflicted the punishment in due
accordance with Law, does not enhance it on becoming apprised of the
fact of the culprit being a very wealthy person,—or does not reduce it
through considerations of friendship towards him.

‘*Wise*’—he who fully understands the mutual effects of time, place &c
and their special relations; sometimes the effect of the time is
nullified by that of place, and *vice-versa*; or both these are
nullified by considerations of Learning and Power; and who also
recognises the special relations among them, as regards their wider or
more restricted application. Under certain circumstances what has been
the nullifier before becomes the nullified. So that *wisdom* is
necessary for the proper discernment of this; and also for recognising
the relative importance or non-importance of virtue, pleasure and
wealth. For instance, if it is found that the acquiring of a little
virtue would lead to a great evil (discomfort or loss of wealth), that
virtue may be abandoned; and this abandonment may be expiated by
penances.—(26).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 647) which explains
‘*samīkṣya kāriṇam*’ as ‘one who acts after due consideration of the
exigencies of time and place.’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 262), which
adds the same explanation of ‘*samīkṣya kāriṇam*.’

*Kāmandaka* (1.49).—‘From a strict observance of scriptural injunctions
and interdictions, wealth is acquired; from wealth proceeds desire; and
the fruition of desires brings happiness. He who does not indulge in the
reasonable enjoyment of these three objects destroys these, and also his
own self.’

Do. (2.16).—‘By the right administration of justice the king should
protect himself and encourage the branches of knowledge. The science of
government benefits mankind directly and the king is its preserver.’

Do. (2.25).—‘Punishments dealt out proportionately to offences increase
the *Trivarga* of the king; disproportionate punishment excites anger
even in Renunciates.’

*Gautama* (11.2).—‘The king shall be pure in acts and speech.’

*Yājñavalkya*. (1.308-309).—‘The king shall be modest, endowed with
virility, of noble family, truthful in words, pure, non-procrastinating,
with keen memory, not. mean and not cruel; righteous, not addicted to
evil habits, intelligent, brave, conversant with secrets.’
