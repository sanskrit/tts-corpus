<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When a man has been attacked by a strong enemy, recouping is impossible;
what is beneficial is resorting to a fortress; and this means
garrisoning, which involves ‘bifurcation’; this has been already
explained above. As a matter of fact, it is found that, under ordinary
circumstances, it is only the more powerful king who divides his forces,
when under difficulties.—(173)
