**धृतः प्रणीतः** प्रवर्तितः । **समीक्ष्य** । पूर्वोक्तदेशकालाद्य् अपेक्ष्य **समीक्ष्य** । **रञ्जयत्य्** अनुरागं प्रजासु जनयति । विपरीतं प्रणीयमानो न केवलं स्वकार्यं न करोति, यावद् दुरुपयुक्तो विषवद् विनाशयत्य् अर्थं जनस्य ॥ ७.१९ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Meted out*’—inflicted, set up.

‘*After due investigation*’—*i.e*., after having duly examined the
peculiarities of ‘time’, ‘place’ and other details mentioned before
(Verse 10).

‘*Makes happy*’—incites affection among the people.

When inflicted in a manner contrary to this, it does not -only fail in
its own purpose; in fact when wrongly administered, it destroys the best
interests of the people.—(19)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 647), which explains
‘*svadhṛtaḥ*’ (which is its reading for *sa dhṛtaḥ*) as ‘deservedly
inflicted’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 292) and also on p.
284;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 262), which explains ‘*sudhṛtaḥ*’
(which is its reading for *sa dhṛtaḥ*) as ‘properly
administered,’—‘*samīkṣya*’ as ‘according to the scriptures’.

*Yājñavalkya* (1.354-356).—‘When inflicted according to the law,
punishment renders happy the entire universe of gods, *asuras* and men;
otherwise it creates disturbance among them. Illegal punishment is
destructive of heaven, fame and popularity; legal punishment brings to
the king Heaven, fame and victory.’

नैतावता मुच्यामहे, असम्यग्धृतः कार्यं न करोतीति । यथैव सम्यग्धृतो **रञ्जयति प्रजाः**, एवम् असम्यग्धृतः सर्वम् एव **विनाशयति** ॥ ७.१९ ॥
