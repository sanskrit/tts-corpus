न राजा शास्त्रं[^२३] **शास्ति** कर्तव्याकर्तव्योर् विधिनिषेधयोः, किं तर्हि, **दण्ड** एव । **दण्ड एवाभिरक्षति** बलवद्भ्यो दुर्बलान् । **सुप्तेषु** राजपुरुषेषु दण्दभयाद् एव न यथाकामं लोको व्यवहरति । द्विविधो दण्डः, राजदण्डो यमदण्डश् च ॥ ७.१८ ॥

It is not the King that administers the law, relating to the Injunction
of what ought to be done and the Prohibition of what ought not to be
done; it is Punishment that does this administering.

‘*Punishment alone protects*’— the weak against the strong.

‘*While all*’—King’s officers—‘*are asleep*’— it is only through fear of
punishment that people desist from doing what they like.

There are two kinds of this Punishment,—(*a*) that inflicted by the King
and (*b*) that inflicted by the God of Death (in hell).—(18)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 646), which explains
*jāgarti* as ‘being awake’ in the sense that it serves the purpose of
freeing men from all fear of thieves and other mischief-makers;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 292);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 261),
which says that ‘*jāgarti*’ means that he does the work of quelling
thieves, which can be done only by a wakeful and watchful person.

018	Punishment alone governs all created beings, punishment alone protects them, punishment watches over them while they sleep; the wise declare punishment (to be identical with) the law.
