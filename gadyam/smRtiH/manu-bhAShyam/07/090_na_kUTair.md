**कूटानि** यानि बहिःकाष्ठमयान्य् अन्तर्निशितशस्त्राणि । **कर्णिनः** । शरा ये शल्यस्य मूले मध्ये वा कर्णाकारैः फलकैः क्रियन्ते । ते हि प्रविष्टा दुरुद्धरा भवन्ति, उद्ध्रियमाणाः प्रहारैर् अभिन्नम् अपि शरिरैकदेशं भिन्दन्ति । **दिग्धाः** विषोपलिप्ताः । अग्निना ज्वलितम् आदीपितं तेजोमयफलकं येषाम् । एतैर् न योद्धव्यम् ॥ ७.९० ॥

The author proceeds to indicate such rules as appertain to superphysical
results.

‘*Concealed*’—those that have a wooden exterior, but sharpened weapons
within.

‘*Barbed*’—those arrows that are supplied, either at the base or in the
middle of their shafts, with ear-shaped barbs, which, once they enter
the flesh, can be withdrawn with difficulty ; and even when withdrawn
they lascerate even those parts of the body that may not have been
wounded by weapons.

‘*Poisoned*’—besmeared with poison.

Those whose shafts are ‘*flaming*’, i.e., consisting of fire. He shell
not fight with such weapons.—(90)
