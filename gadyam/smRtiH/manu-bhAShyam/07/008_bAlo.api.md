**मनुष्यो** ऽयम् **इत्य्** एवं **बालो ऽपि** **भूमिपो** राजा **नावमन्तव्यः** । किं तर्हि, **महती** काचिद् **एषा** **देवता** एतेन मानुषेण **रूपेण** स्थितेति । अतो ऽदृष्टेनापि दोषेण राजन्य् अवज्ञा न युज्येत ॥ ७.८ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Even on infant King shall not be regarded as merely a human being, and
as such despised. In fact he is a great divinity, appearing in the shape
of man. For this reason it is not right to show disrespect towards the
King, even on account of defects that may be perceived in him.—(8)

This verse occurs also in the *Mahābhārata*.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—in the same
work (Vyavahāra, p. 5);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 17), to the
effect that by showing disrespect to the king one incurs the same sin
that he does by showing disrespect towards the gods.
