Punishment, which is a tremendous force, hard to be controlled by persons with undisciplined minds, destroys the King who has swerved from duty, along with his relatives.—(28).

Punishment is a tremendous force; and it cannot be properly administered
by persons who have not been disciplined by the study of the scriptures
and the service of teachers, or by inborn humility.

One should not entertain the idea that ‘punishment can be meted out by
mere word of command, and there is no difficulty in controlling it;
because if a King is not careful with regard to it, and does not devote
special attention to it, he commits mistakes, and is, on that account,
destroyed by the Punishment, along with hi relatives. The King is struck
down not only physically by himself, but along with his whole family of
sons and grandsons.—(28).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 647) which adds that
punishment is called ‘*sumahattejaḥ*’ in the sense that it is extremely
sharp;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 262), which says that ‘*bāndhava*’
here stands for the *son*,—and that ‘*sumahat tejaḥ*’ refers to its
forcible character.

028	Punishment (possesses) a very bright lustre, and is hard to be administered by men with unimproved minds; it strikes down the king who swerves from his duty, together with his relatives.
