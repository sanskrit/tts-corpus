‘*Revenue*’—the tux, in the shape of the sixth part of the produce of
grains.

*By trusted men*’—by men who have been tested by means of tests.

‘*He shall stick to the scriptures*’— as detailed above. That is, he
shall have recourse to such sciences of reasoning &c. as depend mostly
upon the scriptures. Or, it may mean that he shall receive only such
part, of the produce as ‘tax’ as may be sanctioned by established usage,
never more than that.

‘*Towards the people he shall behave like a father*’.— That is, he shall
behave lovingly towards those who pay the taxes, as also towards
others.—(80)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 407);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 187), which explains ‘*sāṃvatsarikam
balim*’ as the ‘yearly tax’,—‘*loke*’ as ‘among the people’,—and
‘*āśrayaparaḥ*’ as ‘inclined to provide livings for the poor and the
helpless.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.321).—‘For the king there is no act more meritorious
than this that what he obtains by war he gives away to Brāhmaṇas and the
gift of fearlessness to the people.’

*Kāmandaka* (5.78, 79).—‘Agriculture, communications to facilitate
commercial traffic, entrenchment of strongholds for soldiers in the
capital, construction of dams and bridges across rivers, erection of
enclosures for elephants, working of mines and quarries, felling and
selling of timber and the peopling of uninhabited tracts,—these
eightfold sources of revenue, the king should ever enhance; his officers
looking up to him for livelihood should also do so, for maintaining
themselves.’
