‘*Employed*’—appointed;—‘*women*’— slave-girls and others working in the
inner apartments;—‘*of menial* servants’—such, as bearers of palanquins
and the like;—‘*he* *shall fix daily wages*’,—and not fix an annual
maintenance, in the form of villages, in whole or in part.

‘*In proportion to their position and work*’. ‘*Position*’ stands for
the principal duty, responsibility,—such as keeping guard over the bed
and so forth; and ‘*work*’—*i.e*. physical labour involved; the wages
given should be in proportion to these. If the responsibility is great,
even though the physical work in volved be little, the wages should be
high; and if the responsibility is not great, even though the physical
labour involved be great, the wages shall be low. This is what is meant
by the wages being ‘*in proportion to the position and work*’.—(125)
