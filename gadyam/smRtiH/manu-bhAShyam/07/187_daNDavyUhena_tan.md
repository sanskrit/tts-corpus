When the army is arranged in the shape of a staff, it is said to be
‘*arrayed in the form of* a *staff*’; similarly when in the shape of the
cart, it is ‘arrayed in the *form of a cart*’; and so on with the rest.

\(A\) In the fore-front, there is the Commander of the entire
force,—then the king in the centre,—then the army-commander,—on his two
flinks, the elephants,—close to them the horses,—then the footsoldiers;
the whole of this army being, like the staff and operating in a straight
line.

\(B\) Operating on both sides is the ‘*needle-array*’, in which the
soldiers operate in a solid mass, the bravest being in the forefront; it
constitutes a very much-lengthened line, all operating simultaneously.

\(C\) The ‘*alligator-array*’ is broad at the front face and at the two
flanks (thighs), and highly recommended; as nowhere in this array is
there any weak point; and even when pressed by braver enemies, it leads
to the breaking up of the enemy’s forces; and in the end its purpose is
entirely and surely accomplished. The rest of the army is to be thrown
into the middle of the array.

The above-mentioned dispositions of the army ore to by resorted to in
accordance with the end in view; on even ground the advance should be
made either in the ‘staff’ or the ‘needle’ or the ‘*garuḍa*’ array; but
on uneven ground, and on ground beset with obstructions, etc. that of
the ‘cart’ or the ‘alligator’ or the ‘boar’.—(187)

See Kāmandaka, 19, for the various kinds of tactical disposition of the
forces.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 401);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 400), which adds that full descriptions of
the several *Vyūhas* the reader will find in *Lakṣaṇaprakāśa*;—and in
*Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 26a).

*Śukranīti* (4.7.551 *et seq*.).—‘The *Krauñca-* array is formed
according to the nature of the ground and consists in arranging the
troops in rows resembling the rows of birds flying in the sky; it is
that order in which the neck is thin, the tail medium and the wings
thick. The *Śyena* -array is that in which the wings are large, the neck
and tail medium, and the mouth small. The *Makara* -array is that which
has four legs, long and thick mouth and two lips. The *Sūcī-* array has
a thin mouth and a hole at the back and resembles a rod.—The *Chakra-*
array has eight concentric circles facing all directions and one
passage. The *Sarvatobhadra* -array is the order having eight sides in
all directions. The *Ratha* -array has the aspect of a cart, and the
*Sarpa* -array, that of a snake.’

*Kāmandaka* (18.49).—‘When there would be danger in the rear, the
Chariot-array should be formed; when it would he in the flanks, then the
*Vajra* -array; and in all situations the *Sarvatobhadra* -array should
be formed, which frightens the enemy.’

187	Let him march on his road, arraying (his troops) like a staff (i.e. in an oblong), or like a waggon (i.e. in a wedge), or like a boar (i.e. in a rhombus), or like a Makara (i.e. in two triangles, with the apices joined), or like a pin (i.e. in a long line), or like a Garuda (i.e. in a rhomboid with far-extended wings).
