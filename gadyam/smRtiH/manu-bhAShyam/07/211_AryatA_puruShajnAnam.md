Or, having made peace with his enemy, he, may return, accompanied by the latter,—finding in this the due fulfilment of the threefold reward consisting of an ally, gold and territory.—(206)


In his ‘circle’, having paid due attention to the ally who forms his rear guard, and also to the ally who occupies the position next to the said ally, the king shall obtain the result of his expedition either from his friend or from his foe.—(207)


The king does not prosper so much by gaining gold and territory as he does by obtaining a firm ally, even though this latter be weak, if fraught with future possibilities.—(208)


Even a weak ally is highly commended, if he is righteous and grateful, has his people content, and is loyal and persevering in his actions—(209)


The wise ones describe that enemy to be most troublesome who is intelligent, of noble race, brave, clever, charitable, grateful and firm.—(210)


Gentlemanliness, knowledge of men, bravery, compassionate disposition, and constant liberality are the qualities to be sought for in a Neutral.—(211)

**(verses 7.206-211)**

For all men, agencies of happiness and unhappiness are set up by
Destiny, which is also styled ‘merit-demerit’; and when men fall into
troublesome positions, they pacify the unfavourable Destiny leading to
it by special efforts put forth towards the alleviating of the evil
influences; so that they are rendered favourable in the final result.
(?)

The ‘*knowledge* *of* *men*’ stands for *worldly experience*. The man
who is worldly wise is capable of rendering great help.

The ‘*brave*’ man is generally clever in business.

The ‘*compassionate*’ man, is one who is of sympathetic nature, and
always saves men from undue greed (?)

The ‘*liberal*’ man is one who is always capable of providing a large
amount of wealth, (206-211)

**(verse 7.206)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrddaya* (Rājanīti, p. 412), which adds
the following notes:—The particle ‘*vā*’ indicates that what the verse
is speaking of is the alternative to war;—‘*prayatnato yuktaḥ*,’ ‘having
become fully equipped with all the equipments, such as sending the
ambassador and so forth, necessary for marching on the conquering
expedition,’—‘*saha*’, ‘with the enemy,’—‘*sandhim* *kṛtvā*,’ ‘having
made peace’;—‘*sampaśyan*,’ ‘rightly discerning,’ the ‘*triple result*’
in the shape of ‘friend, gold and territory’, and hence making peace on
the acquisition of any one of these three, he should ‘depart’, return to
his own kingdom.

**(verse 7.207)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya*, (Rājanīti, p. 412), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Maṇḍale*,’ ‘in the circle of twelve enemies’;—the
‘*pārṣṇigrāha*’, is the enemy whose territory lies immediately in the
rear of the king who is marching on an expedition against a state in his
front;—‘*ākranda*’ is the king whose territory lies behind that of the
said *pārsṇigraha*,—‘*samprekṣya*’, ‘having duly examined the strength
and weakness of both these’;—‘*mitrāt*’, ‘from the king against whom he
was marching and with whom he has made peace;’—‘*amitrāt*’, ‘from the
enemy against whom he was marching and who has not made peace with
him’,—the king undertaking the expedition shall obtain the point of his
expedition—in the shape either of victory over the enemy, or one of the
‘three results’ of *peace, in the shape of* ‘*fri* *end, gold and
territory*.’

**(verse 7.208)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 277);—and in
*Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 29a).

**(verse 7.209)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 277).

**(verse 7.210)**

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 743), as describing the
‘dangerous enemy’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Lakṣaṇa, p. 218);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 323).

**(verse 7.211)**

‘*Sthaulalakṣyam*’—‘Great liberality’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa, Rāghavānanda
and Nandana);—Kullūka asserts that both Govindarāja and Medhātithi
explain the term as being ‘not sharp-sighted.’ As regards Medhātithi,
whose explanation Buhler could not decipher, his words
are—‘*Sthūlalakṣaḥ prabhūtasyāpi arthameṣām sarvakālam kṣamate*’, which
means that the man who is ‘*sthūlalakṣa*’ looks with equanimity upon the
ever-increasing prosperity of these (*i.e*., other kings). This may
imply *absence of sharp-sightedness*.—Hopkins says “Medhātīthi and
Govindarāja erroneously interpret as *subtility*”. While Govindarāja is
said by Buhler to explain the term to mean ‘*sūkṣmadars-hitvam* but this
is evidently wrong; as the *initial* ‘*a*’ Buhler has failed to notice
in the manuscript

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitṛodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 323).

*Yājñavalkya* (1.351).—‘Among all gains—those of gold, land and so
forth,—the gain of a friend is the best of all.’

kinds of friends—(1) hereditary, (2) the subsidiaries of the enemy, and
(3) artificial friend.’

and Rand, the preceding is superior to the succeeding; Gold and Friend
