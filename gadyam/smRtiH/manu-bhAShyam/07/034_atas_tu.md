disciplined his mind in the manner prescribed in the scriptures.—(34)

*Śukranīti* (1.64-68).—‘The miserable king who is not compassionate and
is mad through passions......attachment to sensuous objects......who is
not uniform in thought, word and deed......is called *Rājasa* and is
born as a low animal.’
