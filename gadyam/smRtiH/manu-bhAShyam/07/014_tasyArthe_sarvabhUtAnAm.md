The origin of the King has been described; the origin of Punishment is
now described.

‘*For his sake*’— for the due fulfilment of the purposes of the
King,—‘*the Lord*’—Prajāpati—‘*created Punishment*’.

“What purpose of the King is served by Punishment?”

The answer is as follows—It is ‘*the protector of all creatures*’;—it is
Punishment that ‘*protects*’—guards—all creatures; as without Punishment
the King cannot carry on the work of protecting the people. Thus it was
for the proper accomplishment of the kingly function that Punishment was
created.

\(a\) ‘*It is Law*, (*b*) *born of the Lord himself*, (*c*) *incarnation
of divine glory*’.—(*a*) ‘Law’ does not consist of sacrifices and gifts;
it consists of Punishment, (*b*) Nor should it be regarded as an
inferior form of Law, by reason of its depriving men of their life and
property because it is that Law which is born out of the body of the
Lord, Prajāpati, himself, (*c*) Nor is it composed of the five material
substances; it is created out of the pure^(‘)glory’ of Brahman himself.

‘*At* *fir* *st*,’—before the creation of the King himself,—(14)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p 393);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 283), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Tadartham*’ means ‘for the accomplishment of the king’s
purpose’; protecting of the people is the king’s duty, and as this
protecting cannot be done without punishment, it is punishment itself
that is called the ‘protection’ and it is eulogised by being styled
‘Dharma’ itself.—It is quoted again on p. 292.

The verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 646), which adds the
following notes:—The merit arising from the protection of the people is
the king’s ‘*Artha*’ or ‘purpose’—for the sake of this the ‘Lord’,
Creator of the people, created punishment, which is ‘*brahmatejomayam*
(*brahmatejomaya*),’ the natural Power of Hiraṇyagarbha, and which is
‘Dharma’ itself, *i.e*., the consolidator of Dharma;—both these epithets
being purely valedictory and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 261), which
explains ‘*tadartham dharmam*’ as for the purpose of establishing
Dharma;—and ‘*brahmatejomayam*’ as ‘constituted of the essence of
Hiraṇyagarbha’;—it adds that this is mere eulogy.

It is quoted also in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 37b).
