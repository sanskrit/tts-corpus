That punishment is the ‘King’, the ‘Man’; that is the ‘Leader’ and the ‘Ruler’ and that has been declared to be the ‘surety’ for the Law of the Four Stages.—(17)

**स** एव वस्तुतो **राजा** । तस्मिन् सति राजशक्तिः । **स** एव **पुरुषः** । येन बलीयसो ऽपि पुरुषान् स्त्रीवन् न्यक्कृत्य वशीकरोति । **स** **नेता** । कार्याणि तेन नीयन्ते । **शासिता** । शासनं राजाज्ञा, तस्याः शासनीभावः दण्डे सति । धर्मतः कर्तृत्वम् औपचारिकम् । **चतुर्णाम् आश्रमाणां** यो धर्मस् तत्र **स** **प्रतिभूर्** इव । यथा प्रतिभूश् चलितुं न ददाति, तद्वद् दण्डो ऽपि ॥ ७.१७ ॥

That in reality is ‘*King*’;—as it is by reason of Punishment that the
King’s power holds.

That is the ‘*Man*’;—since it disregards even powerful men and brings
them under its power.

That is the ‘*Leader*’;—all business is led, managed, by it.

‘*Ruler*’—‘Ruling’ consists in the King’s commands; and these latter are
capable of controlling men only when there is Punishment; and it is in
this sense that the actual act of *ruling* has been figuratively
attributed to it.

It is like ‘*surety*’ of ‘*the Law of the Four Stages*’;—*i.e*.,
Punishment does not allow men to swerve from their duty in the same
manner as the surety does not allow the party to deviate from the
stipulated conditions.—(17)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 646), which adds the
following notes:—*Rājā*, so called because of his *giving satisfaction*
(*rañjanāt*),—*puruṣaḥ*, ‘equal to the Supreme Being’, residing in the
hearts of the people;—he is the *netā*, the ‘leader’, the propagator of
*Dharma*.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 292);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 261), which has the following notes:—*Rājā*, so
called because he keeps the people contented
(*prajārañjanāt*),—*puruṣaḥ*, the Supreme Person, because he abides in
the heart (*puri shete*) of the people,—*netā*,— ruler,
master,—‘*śāsitā*’, the propagator of proper righteousness.

**(verses 7.17-18)  
**

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 286).—‘Punishment governs all
creatures; punishment alone protects them; punishment lies awake while
all are asleep; the wise regard punishment as Law itself.’

*Mahābhārata* (Do., p. 287).—‘It is punishment that protects Dharma, and
also property; it is punishment that protects pleasure; hence is
punishment called the *Triad*; by punishment is grain protected, as also
wealth.’

**दण्ड** एव **राजा**, तन्निमित्तत्वाद् राजत्वस्य । स एव **पुरुषः**, येन बलीयसो ऽपि पुरुषान् स्त्रीवन् न्यक्क्र्त्वा वशम् आनयति । स नेता यस्मात् तद्भयाद् एव कार्याणि सम्याङ् नीयन्ते । स एव **शासिता** येन तदपेक्षयैव वासना शासनीभवति । स एव **पतिभूर्** वर्णाश्रमव्यतिक्रमे प्रतिभूर् इव प्रतिभूः ॥ ७.१७ ॥
