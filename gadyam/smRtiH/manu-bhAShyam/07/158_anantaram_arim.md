One who is the immediate neighbour of the king bent on conquest shall be
regarded as his enemy; as also the enemy’s ally. Similarly he shall
regard as his friend the immediate neighbour of his enemy. The King who
is beyond these two is ‘*neutral*.’

These same characteristics of the ‘friend’ and the ‘enemy’ are to be
found in the ‘born’ and ‘acquired’ ones also.—(158)
