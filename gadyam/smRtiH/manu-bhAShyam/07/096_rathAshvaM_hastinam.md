‘*Baser metals*’—utensils of copper etc. as also beds and chairs etc.

‘*Belong to him who wins them*.’— The king being the master of all, he
might take away all the spoils of war; hence the text mentions a few
exceptions.

Gold, silver, lands, buildings and so forth accrue to the King; hence
the necessity of enumerating those that do not go to him. Arms and
conveyances also accrue to the King.

‘*Grains*’ and other things being mentioned separately, the term
‘wealth’ stands for cows, buffalos etc.

It is is view of all this that there is the popular saying—Half belongs
to the King’.—(96)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 409), which adds
the following explanations:—‘*Sarvadravyāṇi*’ stands for ‘clothes and
other things’,—‘*kupya*’ for ‘copper and metals other than gold and
silver’.

**(verses 7.96-98)  
**

*Gautama* (1.20-23).—‘The victor shall receive the booty gained in
battle. But chariots and riding animals belong to the king, also a
preferential share; except when the booty has been gained in single
combat, the king shall equally divide all other spoils.’

*Āditya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 409).—‘Having satisfied the
??ng (King?) in the battle, and having won the booty from Kṣatriyas
killed in battle, if the soldier does not take to himself any of the
booty, he goes to heaven. If the king who having conquered a kingdom but
desisting from taking any booty therefrom, happen to be killed, be goes
to heaven.’
