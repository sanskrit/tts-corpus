Though his mind be already disciplined, he shall always learn discipline from them; the King with a disciplined mind never perishes.—(39).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The use of waiting upon elderly men is next described,

‘*From them*’—from the learned *Brāhmaṇas—‘he shall learn
discipline*’—the proper kingly behaviour.

‘*Though his mind be already disciplined*’;—though he may be already
disciplined by his own will, or by the proper study of political
science,—yet he should carefully attend to the advice of elderly
persons; because men with practical experience are better experts than
those possessing only theoretical knowledge. Or even though highly
trained, he shall train his mind under elderly qualified men, for the
purpose of making his aptitude keener. Just as gold, even though pure by
its nature, becomes purer and brighter to look at when it undergoes
purification by being put in lire.

The reward of this discipline is that the King never perishes—(39)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 119), as
describing the results proceeding from doing what is prescribed in the
preceding verse; it adds the notes that ‘even though the king be already
well-disciplined, yet he should learn discipline further, for the
purpose of securing greater efficiency.’

*Kāmandaka* (1.20).—‘Humility is synonymous with thorough control over
the senses. One possessing it becomes learned in the Śāstras.’

*Arthaśāstra* (8.34).—‘Punishment brings about security of life and
property only when it is based upon discipline. Discipline is of two
kinds—artificial and natural. Learning disciplines only such a man as
has his intelligence duly cultivated through service, listening to
teachings, carrying them in memory, and knowledge of reasonings and
arguments.’

*Śukranīti* (1.101).—‘Discipline is the chief thing for the king; this
comes through the dictates of Śāstra; it gives mastery over the senses.’

039	Let him, though he may already be modest, constantly learn modesty from them; for a king who is modest never perishes.
