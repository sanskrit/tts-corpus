‘*Thus*’—in the manner described *above*;—‘*the king, having discussed
all this*’— business described above, what, should be done in normal
times and also in abnormal times, and what, under what
circumstances—‘*with his ministers*’;—‘*at midday*,’ ‘*he shall take
exercise*’ and ‘*bathe*’. Through the mention of *bathing* is rather out
of place in the present context, yet it has been mentioned in view of
its tending to suspiciousness (and success). For the purpose of
*bathing*, and for that of *eating*, the king shall—before bathing—enter
the inner apartment. It is with a view to lay down this special fact
that the author has had recourse to this form of summing up.—(216)
