‘*Difficulties regarding weapons*’—such as the breaking of weapons, the
sword becoming crooked, the snapping of the bowstring and so forth.

‘*In distress*’—on having lost his son or brother or some other
relative.

‘*Frightened*’— showing such signs of fear as the paleness of face and
the like, even though still facing his foe.

‘*Turned back*’— starding with his face turned away.

These are positive rules to be observed. If they are to be regarded as
prohibitions, the non-observance of them would be sinful; \[which would
mean that their observance would simply save the man from that sin, and
in that case\] the declaration regarding the attaining of Heaven would
be purely commendatory.

What then is the right view to take regarding these rules?

They are prohibitions set up for the man’s benefit, standing on the same
footing as the prohibition of eating the flesh of the animal killed by a
poisoned arrow. It is only when we take the rules thus that the negative
word retains its primary meaning.

‘*Remembering the duties of honourable men*’—the sense of ‘*anu*’ is
that such is the usage of all cultured men.—(93)
