This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 413);—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 1.308);—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 717), which explains
‘*paiśunya*’ as ‘proclaiming the unknown faults of others,
malice,’—‘*sāhasa*’ as ‘punishing the guiltless with imprisonment and so
forth,’—‘*droha*’ as ‘desire to injure others,’ ‘*īrṣyā*’ as ‘not
brooking the good of others,’—‘*asūyā*’ as ‘finding fault with the good
quality in others,’—and ‘*arthadūṣaṇam*’ as ‘seizing of property and
witholding of what is due’;—again on p. 742, where the same explanations
are repeated.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 148), which notes that the
number ‘eight’ is made up by ‘*vākpāruṣyam*’ and ‘*daṇḍajam pāruṣyam*
and goes on to explain ‘*paiśunyam*’ as ‘malice, proclaiming such faults
of others as are not generally known,’—‘*sāhasa*’ as ‘punishing of the
innocent with imprisonment and so forth,’—‘*droha*’ as ‘injuring the
Brāhmaṇa,’—‘*īrṣyā*’ as ‘not bearing the good of others,’—‘*asūyā*’ as
‘picking faults in the good qualities of others,’—‘*arthadūṣaṇa*’ as
‘seizing the property of others and witholding what is due to
others,’—‘*vākpāruṣya*’ as ‘reviling and so forth,’—and ‘*daṇḍapāruṣya*’
as ‘harshness of punishment, *i.e*., the imposing of heavy fines or
corporal punishment, for slight offences.’
