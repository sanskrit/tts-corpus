<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When he is holding counsel, the King shall remove every kind of living
being from the place; he shall send them all away from there, for fear
of his secrets leaking out.

Among *animals* also, parrots and such others often disclose secrets;
cows and horses also, under the influence of some magical art, have been
heard to have their shape transformed and thereby made carriers of good
and bad news; and we hear of such Kingly arts as those of making animals
to disappear and so forth.

The ‘idiot’ and the rest being already included under the ‘maimed’, the
separate mention of all these is analogous to the expression
‘*go-balīvarda*’ (where even though the *balīvarda*, ox, is included
under the ‘*go*’, yet it is mentioned separately; and the ‘maimed’ have
been mentioned separately with a view to preclude the notion being
entertained that ‘the maimed person, being without bands and feet,
cannot go out, he must stay locked up on, so that how could he divulge
our secret?’

Or, the verse may mean that the persons specified shall not be made
councillors, on account of the possibility of their intellect being
defective,—and hence they should not be confided in either; so that it
becomes necessary that they shall be sent away.—(149)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 309), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Jaḍa*’ is ‘one who is devoid of intelligence,
idiot,’—‘*tairyagyonāḥ*’,—‘parrots, starlings and the
like,’—‘*vayotigāhi*,’ ‘very old persons,’—‘*Mleccha*’, stands for
‘persons whose language is not intelligible’;—for ‘*Mleccho*’, another
reading is ‘*klībo*.’

It is quoted in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 22b).

*Agnipurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 308).—‘Secret counsel is
divulged by women and dishonoured persons.’

*Mahābhārata* (Do., p. 310).—‘The following are the ways by which secret
counsel becomes divulged,—hence one who is desirous of continued
prosperity should guard against these—intoxication, sleep,
ill-treatment, appearance, trust in wicked councillors and inept
ambassador.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Do.)—‘The king shall never hold counsel with
illiterate or untrustworthy or unrighteous persons.’
