स्वराष्ट्रे ऽत्यन्तम् अवहितेनानुराग उत्पादनीयः । तद् धि शरीरस्थानीयम् । शरीरे कर्शिते ऽपथ्यभोजनरुक्षभोजनादिभिर् **यथा प्राणा** उत्क्रामन्ति, एवं **राष्ट्रकर्शनाद्** अपि ॥ ७.११२ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In his own kingdom the King should very carefully cultivate the good
feelings of his people; since the kingdom occupies the position of body
in relation to the King; when the body becomes emasciated by such causes
as the eating of indigestible and unwholesome food and the like, the
life goes out of it; similar results follow from the oppression of the
Kingdom.
