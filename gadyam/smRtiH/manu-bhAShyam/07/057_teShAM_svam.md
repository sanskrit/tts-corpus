<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Having ascertained in private the opinion of each of them—the opinion
entertained by them in his heart of hearts—also ‘*collectively*’;—he
shall do this because some people are shy in assemblies, but bold in
private, while others are more fit in assemblies; hence he shall
question the ministers collectively also.

After that he shall do whatever appears to him to be most proper
—‘*beneficial to himself*’; be it what one of the ministers themselves
may have advised, and had not been opposed by others; and hence
indicated to be free from objections.—(57)

*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 178).—‘In a kingdom when
ministers, courtiers and physicians are given to flattery, the king
shall certainly lose his kingdom, his righteousness and his happiness.
The king shall not evince displeasure at anything that they say; because
it is their duty to say what is right and according to law.’

*Kāmandaka* (11.77).—‘A king seeking his own welfare should discuss the
subject of consultation severally with each of his ministers; after
which he should take into serious consideration the opinion expressed by
each.’
