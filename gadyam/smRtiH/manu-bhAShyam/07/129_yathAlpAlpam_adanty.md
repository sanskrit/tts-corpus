The order of verses 128 and 129 of Medhātithi is reversed in the other
commentaries and hence by Buhler and Burnell.

‘*The person engaged in business*’—the trader—‘*and* *the king*’—may
receive their reward;—in such way should the taxes be levied; and there
is no ground for fixing the amount of the tax; in fact where the profit
made has been large, the King should charge heavier taxes—even exceeding
the proportion fixed.—(129)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 404);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 260), which adds the following
explanation:—The king should impose taxes in such a manner that he
himself gets some reward for what he does in the shape of seeming safety
to life and property, and also the transactors of business—the
cultivator, the trader and others—idso obtain a fair return for the work
that they do, in the shape of tilling the soil, trading and so
forth;—again on p. 264, to the effect that the taxes may be enhanced or
reduced in consideration of the loss or gain actually accruing to the
people concerned.
