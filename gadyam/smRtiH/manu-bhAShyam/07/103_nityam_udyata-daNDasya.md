<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse describes the effect of what has been just laid down in the
foregoing verse.

‘*The whole world stands in awe*’—is afraid; and his glory becomes
proclaimed.

‘*Therefore all men*’—his own subjects, as well as others—‘*he* *shall
subdue by means of force*’.

The enemies of the king who acts thus bow down to him without any effort
on his part.—(103)
