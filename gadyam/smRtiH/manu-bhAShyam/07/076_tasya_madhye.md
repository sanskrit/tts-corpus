‘*Spacious*’—as large as may be necessary for the king, his sons, his
treasury, armoury, stables and other necessities.

‘*Well guarded*’—with several compartments.

Such a palace he shall get built for himself.

‘*Equipped with all* seasons’—adorned with flowers and garlands of all
seasons: thus all the seasons would be present there. The term
‘*seasons*’ stands for the *produetts* of the seasons, in the shape of
flowers, fruits etc.

If we read ‘*Sarvartugam*’—it means ‘the place where all the seasons are
present’. The sense remains the same in both cases. When a thing is
*present* in a place, the place is said to be *equipped* with it.

‘*Resplendent*’—whitewashed with lime.

‘*Supplied with water and trees*’—equipped with fountains, gardens and
parks.—(76)

‘*Sarvartukam*’—‘Provided with the produce of all seasons’ (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘habitable in all seasons’
(Nandana and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 407);—and in
*Nītimayūkha* (p. 65), which explains ‘*sarvartukam*’ as ‘with gardens
containing trees of fruits of all seasons, or stocked with fruits and
flowers of all seasons’,—and ‘*sarvavastusamanvitam*’ as ‘stocked with
things needed in several seasons’.

*Āpastamba* (2. 25.2-3).—‘He shall cause to be built a town and a
palace, the gates of both being towards the South. The palace shall
stand in the heart of the town.’

*Śukranīti* (1.435-437).—‘The palace is to be built in the midst of the
council-buildings, equipped with stables for elephants, horses and
cattle, well adorned with spacious tanks, wells and water-pumps, having
sides of equal length in all directions, high, towards the South and
North.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 206).—‘At the centre of the
fort, the king shall build a separate house supplied with trees and
water, to the East of which facing the East, should be the Hall.’

consulting the astrologer and the architect.’
