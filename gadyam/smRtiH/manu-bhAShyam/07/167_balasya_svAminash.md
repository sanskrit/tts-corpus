When, for the accomplishment of some purpose, the Master takes up one position and the Force another,—this is what is described as ‘Bifurcation’ by those conversant with the details of the six measures of policy.—(167)

**बलस्य स्थितिः स्वामिनश् च** भेदेन । दुर्गस्वामिनः स्वल्पेन बलेन, सेनापतेर् अन्यत्र महता बलेन युक्तस्य । अथ वा बलशपथानुग्रहार्थः कश्चित् कर्तव्यो हिरण्यादिलाभापेक्षया परस् त्व् अधिकेनाशु ।

When different positions are taken up by the Master and his Army,—the
Master, with a small force, remains in the fort, while the Commander,
with a larger force proceeds elsewhere. Or, some sort of ‘bifurcation’
is resorted to by way of favouring the different divisions, in the way
of allowing all the divisions opportunities for securing booties of gold
and other things.

*Objection*.—“The measure here described is *Bifurcation*; and of this
there cun be only one form—different positions being taken up by the
Master and his Forces. There is no reason why any other kind of division
should be mentioned; the only bifurcation that need be mentioned is that
consisting in different positions being taken up by the Master and his
Forces.”

The answer to this is that it is by implication that we get at the other
two kinds of ‘bifurcation’—(1) one being that which is done for one’s
own sake and (2) that done for the sake of others.—(167)

“The text really mentions only one method of ‘Division.’ Hence
Medhātithi thinks that, in order to obtain the two kinds required, it
must be understood that the measure may be resorted to either for one’s
sake or for the sake of somebody else.—Nārāyaṇa makes the two methods
out by supposing that in the one case the army stops in front of the
enemy under the command of a general, while the king marches with a
portion of his forces, and that in the other case the contrary takes
place.—Govindarāja quotes Kāmandaki, 11.24, where a different meaning,
‘duplicity’ is attributed to the term ‘*dvaidhībhāva*.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 326) which
explains ‘*sthitiḥ*’ as ‘*dvidhābhūya sthitiḥ*’ ‘taking up a position
with forces divided,’ and adopts the explanation attributed (in the
above note) to Nārāyaṇa;—and in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 24b).

*Kāmandaka* (11.27).—‘*Dvaidhībhāva* is of two kinds: (1) *Svatantra*,
when the man himself has recourse to duplicity and (2) *Paratantra*, in
which a person receives remuneration from contending parties.’

167	If the army stops (in one place) and its master (in another) in order to effect some purpose, that is called by those acquainted with the virtues of the measures of royal policy, the twofold division of the forces.
