Just as the weeder plucks out the weed and preserves the corn, so shall the King preserve his kingdom and destroy his opponents.—(110)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When certain persons plot against the King, the friends and relations of
such persons, as also those that seek to enter into relationship with
them, should not all be ruined,—if they are not in the secret of their
machinations; those alone shall be proceeded against who are actually
wicked, and not his relations; this is what is shown by means of the
instance of the ‘weeder.’

Though the corn and the weed grow together and are in dose touch with
one another, yet the weeder cleverly preserves the corn and plucks out
the weeds; in the same manner from among the plotters and their friends;
those alone should be punished who have actually committed the offence,
and not those who are only related to them. Thus with due discrimination
between the good and the wicked, the former shall be preserved and the
latter punished.—(110)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 253) which
explains ‘*nirdātā*’ as ‘he who weeds out grass and other things growing
in a cultivated field,’—and ‘*Kakṣam*’ as ‘weeds.’

**(verses 7.110-113)  
**

*Bṛhaspati* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 253).—‘Having established his
sovereignty over the land, and having set up fortifications according to
law, he shall employ all his strength in the removing of dangerous
elements.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.334).—‘He shall protect the people from dangers arising
from back-biters, thieves, wicked persons, and desperate criminals, and
specially from *Kāyasthas*.’

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 253).—‘In protecting his
kingdom king shall see to it that the people do not become impoverished.
If the king, through folly or carelessness, allows his kingdom to become
impoverished, he very soon falls off, not only from the kingdom, hut
also from life itself.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.338-339).—‘If the king increases the wealth by means of
illegal exactions from the kingdom, he quickly loses his prosperity and
becomes ruined.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 254).—‘Protecting the people,
removing of dangerous elements and honouring the twice-born—for these
purposes has the king been created.’

110	As the weeder plucks up the weeds and preserves the corn, even so let the king protect his kingdom and destroy his opponents.
