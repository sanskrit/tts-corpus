परस्वम् आदातुं शीलं येषां ते **परस्वादायिनः शठाः** असम्यक्कारिणः प्रायेणाधिकृताः सन्तो भवन्ति । प्राक् शुचयो ऽपि रक्षन्ति[^१४९] वित्तानि । अतः प्राक्शुचित्वानुमानेन नोपेक्षणीयाः, यत्नतः प्रतिजागरितव्याः । **तेभ्यो रक्षेद् इमाः प्रजाः **। न केवलं राजार्थनाशः अनवेक्षया, यावत् प्रजा अपि निर्धनीकुर्वन्ति ॥ ७.१२३ ॥

‘*Bent upon seizinq the properly of others*’—those who. are in the habit
of taking what belongs to others.

‘*Knaves*’—addicted to wicked deeds.

Persons appointed ore likely to become such; even though before
appointment they may be quite honest and hence inclined to protect the
wealth of other persons. Hence the King should not leave them alone,
relying upon their former character; he should be ever watchful of their
conduct.

‘*He shall protect the people against them*,’—By ignoring them, it is
not only the King’s own interest that suffers; the people also become
reduced to poverty.—(123)
