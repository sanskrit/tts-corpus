<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

There may be differences of opinion among these officers regarding the
affairs of the villages.

‘*Another*’—some one other than those under whose sphere of duties those
affairs fall;—‘*minister*’—of superior status;—‘*loyal*’—free from undue
love and hate,—should be appointed for inspecting those affairs.—(120)

‘*Pṛthakkāryāṇi*’—‘Quarrels among each other’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘the separate
affairs of the villagers’ (Nandana),

‘*Snigdhaḥ*’—‘Impartial’ (Medhātíthī);—‘loyal to the king’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 249), which
explains ‘*pṛthakkāryāṇi*’ as ‘quarrels among themselves’;—it notes that
if we adopted the reading ‘*pṛthakkāyāni*,’ the meaning would be
‘matters on which there is a difference of opinion among them.’

*Mahābhārata* (12.87, 9-10).—‘A minister conversant with the Law shall
supervise the doings of all these village-lords.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 249).—‘In accordance with
their duties, he shall make divisions and sub-divisions among them; and
he shall always have their work inspected through spies.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.336-338).—‘Having learnt all about the work of the
officers appointed in the kingdom, through his spies, the king shall
honour the honest and punish the dishonest; those addicted to bribery be
shall banish after confiscating their property, and he shall retain the
Vedic scholars with due honour and gifts.’
