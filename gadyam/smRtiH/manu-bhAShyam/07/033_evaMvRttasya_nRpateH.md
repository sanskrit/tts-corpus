This is a praise of the conduct described.

‘*Even though he may subsist on gleanings*’—*i.e*., even though his
treasure be empty.

‘*His fame spreads*’— becomes well known. And as a result of this, other
kingdoms submit to him, and people of his own kingdom, through love for
him, reuse to deviate from the path of duty.—(33)
