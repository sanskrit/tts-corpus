‘*Naked*’.—‘*Bhagnam*’, ‘broken’, ‘defeated’, is another reading.
Fighting with one without hie arrows having been forbidden, there is no
possibility of any one engaging a ‘*naked*’ person. Hence ‘nakedness’
should be taken as referring to that *partial* nakedness which consists
in *being deprived of the turban or some such part of his armour*. As
regards the ‘*broken*’ or ‘defeated’ man also,—since fighting with ‘one
who has turned to flight’ is also forbidden (in 93),—it means that when
the enemy who, though still facing his victorious foe, says ‘I shall not
fight with you any longer’, he shall not be pressed to continue the
fight.

‘*Nor one who is only looking on and not lighting*’;—the mere on-looker
should not be struck; this prohibition however does not apply to the man
who looks on, as well as fights.

‘*One engaged in fighting with another person*’;—a man who is fighting
one person should not be struck by another.—(92)
