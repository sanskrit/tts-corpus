‘*Contented*’— full of ambition and affection for the king, highly
satisfied with gifts and honours;—when he finds his own ‘*people*’—
ministers and others—to be so;—and ‘*himself to be exceedingly
prosperous*’—rich in treasure, in elephants and horses, and other
things;—then, at such a time, he shall break the treaty under some
pretext and have recourse to war.—(170)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Kāmandaka* (9.33).—‘The king whose *Prakṛtis* are disaffected is
deserted by them at the prospect of war; and he who is excessively
addicted to sensual pleasures becomes so weak as to be easily crushed.’

*Kāmandaka* (15.3).—‘When a king feels sure of his ability to forcibly
slay his foe, even though swelling with power,—then alone should he
start on a military expedition, inflicting injuries on the latter.’

Do. (15.19).—‘Of internal and external defects, the internal is the
graver. Amending the internal defects and providing necessary measures
for the removal of the external ones, the king shall set out on the
expedition.’
