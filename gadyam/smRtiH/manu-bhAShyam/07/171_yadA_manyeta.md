<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Condition*’—is the cause of happiness and strength; *e.g*. having
received much wealth, the harvest having been good, and so forth are the
causes that are conducive to happiness and strength. ‘*Army*’—
consisting of elephants, horses and foot-soldiers.

‘*And that of the enemy is the reverse*’,—‘*then shall he march against
the enemy*’—*i.e*., attack him. The causes that prompt actual marching
against the enemy are not the same that lead the king to make war; in
fact, these latter, as also the loss of happiness and strength of the
enemy’s people, are the causes that should prompt actual marching.—(171)
