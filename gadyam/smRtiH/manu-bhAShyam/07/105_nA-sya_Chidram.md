His enemy should hot know his weak points, but he must know the weak points of the enemy; he should hide the departments (of government) as the tortoise does its limbs; and he should guard his own weak points.—(105)

एष एवार्थः पुनर् उच्यते । तथा यत्नातिशयं कुर्याद् यथा परस्य छिद्रम् अन्विच्छेद् आत्मनश् च रक्षेत् । य एवं क्रुद्धादिः कापटिकादिचारपुरुषैर् ज्ञायते स एवात्मीयो ऽनुनीयत इति । **कूर्मवद् अङ्गं गूहेद्** **रक्षेद् विवरम् आत्मनः** । परोपजापात् स्वच्छिद्ररक्षणं महाप्रयोजनम् इत्य् एतद् अनेनाह ॥ ७.१०५ ॥

The same idea is farther reiterated.

The king shall so act that while he becomes apprised of the enemy’s weak
points, his own remain carefully guarded. When he finds out, through his
trusted spies, that any of his own people belongs to one of the
aforesaid four sets of the ‘angered’ and the rest, he should try to
conciliate them.

His departments he shall hide, like the tortoise, and he shall also
guard his weak points. The guarding of one’s own weak points against the
enemy’s approaches is highly important;—this is what is meant by the
present verse.—(105)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 117), which adds
the following explanation:—He should try his best to keep his weak
points from being known by the enemy, and yet he himself should find out
the weak points of the enemy, such as disaffection among the people and
so forth; just as the tortoise hides within its body its head and other
limbs, in the same manner should he always keep won over to his side, by
bestowing gifts and honours, his own ministers and other officers of
state; and if, by chance, some disaffection should happen to arise among
his people, he should take remedial measures at once.

105	His enemy must not know his weaknesses, but he must know the weaknesses of his enemy; as the tortoise (hides its limbs), even so let him secure the members (of his government against treachery), let him protect his own weak points.
