The Kṣatriya shall not rest contented, in the manner of the *Brāhmaṇa*;
he should on the contrary, make attempts to acquire what he does not
possess. What he has acquired he shall ‘*preserve*’; what has been
preserved he shall ‘augment’; *i.e*., lay by as treasure; then he should
bestow gifts upon suitable recipients. He should not spend all that he
gets; as it has been said that ‘one’s expenditure should be very much
less than his income.’—(100)
