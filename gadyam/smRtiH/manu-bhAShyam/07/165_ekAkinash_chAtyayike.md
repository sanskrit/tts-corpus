The two-foldness of Marching is based upon its being undertaken by the
king alone by himself or accompanied by his ally. The king can march
alone by himself only when he has the requisite strength; otherwise he
can march only when accompanied by his ally.

‘*Emergent occasion*’; *e.g*., when some trouble befalls the enemy, he
becomes the fittest object of attack at that same moment; otherwise, if
time is allowed to lapse, he would recover his strength and thus become
difficult to destroy.—(165)

the ally.
