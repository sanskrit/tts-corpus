If punishment were not inflicted, then the ‘*stronger*’—*i.e*., those
possessed of greater strength, or more energetic, or wieding (wielding?)
weapons, or being larger in numbers—‘*would have roasted the weaker*,
*like fish, on the spit*’;—*i.e*., just as fish are roasted on spit for
food, so would the less powerful, be treated, by the more powerful, by
suffering pecuniarily as well as physically, and also by being deprived
of their wives and so forth.

For this reason the King should ‘*untiringly*’ punish those that deserve
punishment; and he should not entertain any such notions as—‘How can I
carry on an investigation into this matter,? I shall not punish any one
at all.’—(20)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 648), which explains
‘*daṇḍya*’ as ‘one who deserves punishment’;—in *Virāmitrodaya*
(Rājanīti, p. 292),—and also on p. 284, where the following explanation
is added:—Just as people eat fish after cooking it on the spit, so would
the strong injure the weak and take away their riches and other
belongings;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 263), which explains
‘*daṇḍyeṣu*’ as ‘those deserving punishment’.

*Śukranītī* (1.129).—‘If the king is not a perfect guide, his subjects
will get into trouble, as a boat without a helmsman sinks in the ocean.

*Kāmandaka* (1.10).—‘If a king does not lead his people to the path of
rectitude, these are tossed about.’
