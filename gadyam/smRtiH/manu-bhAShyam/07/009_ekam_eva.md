Fire burns only one man who may happen to approach it carelessly; the fire of the King, on the other hand, consumes the entire family, along with its cattle and hoard of wealth.—(9)

The following verses are commendatory supplements to the foregoing
Injunction. Though the context deals with the ‘Duties of Kings’, yet
what is stated here applies to all men.

When a man touches fire with his hand, or goes too near the fire when it
is burning fiercely,—he is said to be ‘approaching it carelessly’; and
when he is thus careless, he becomes burnt. If, however, the King
happens to be angry, he destroys the man along with his wife, children,
relations and property. In fact; on account of the fault committed by
the master of the house, he destroys all those relations and friends
that may happen to be with the family at the time, along with all their
goods and chattels.—(9)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—in the same
work (Vyavahāra, p. 6);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 18), which
adds the following notes:—When a man carelessly approaches too near the
fire, he himself alone is burnt, not his sons or other relations;—others
have explained ‘*durupasarpiṇam*’ as ‘one who approaches the fire for
the purpose of throwing himself into it, with a view to escape from
misery’;—better still than both these explanations is the following
one:—‘When a man, knowing himself to be guilty, proceeds, through
bravado, to touch Fire in an ordeal, it is he alone that is burnt by the
fire; but the king, becoming angry with him, destroys the man himself as
well as his son, brother and other members of the family, along with his
cattle and other possessions.’ It is thus alone that the two halves of
the verse become correlated.
