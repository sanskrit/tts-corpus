In that same inner apartment, he shall, with a view to divert himself,
sport, as long as it pleases him, with the ‘*ladies*’,—his newly-wed
wives.

‘*In due time*’—*i.e*. after such time as is proper for such diversion;
this is to be construed with what follows.

‘*Having amused himself*’—*i.e*. after having shaken off his
fatigue;—‘*he shall*’—either alone by himself, or in the company of
ministers,—‘*ugain attend to*’ such business as may present
itself.—(221)
