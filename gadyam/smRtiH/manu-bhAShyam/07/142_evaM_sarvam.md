‘*Thus*’—refers to the *appointing of assistants* and all the rest that
has been described above.

‘*Arranged*’— accomplished.

‘*Business*’—all that is useful is called ‘business’.

‘*Intent*’—engrossed; hence ‘*watchful*’ or ‘*watchfulness*’ may stand
for infallibility of intellect. In this way shall he protect his
people.—(142)
