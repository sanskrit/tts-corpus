Halting has been declared to be of two kinds:—(1) that which is necessary for one who has become gradually weakened, either by chance or through previous acts, and (2) that which is necessitated by considerations for his ally.—(166)

‘Halting’ means the *withdrawing of oneself*. This also is of two
kinds—(1) When the king is “*weakened*’—in force and in money,—even
though he be prosperous, he has to ignore bis enemy; and another kind of
Halting is that which is done in consideration of the ally. If the
relations of his ally, who is weak, with the enemy is not such as to
make it safe for his ally to rise against that enemy,—then, in
consideration of the delicate position of his ally, the king should
‘*halt*’.

The said ‘*weakness*’ arises from two causes:—it may be due to
‘*chance*’ or to ‘*former acts*’. This only describes the actual state
of things. The strength and weakness of all kings are due to these two
causes. ‘*Chance*’ here stands for the man⁹s want of care, *e.g*.,
extravagance, inalertness regarding the army and so forth; and ‘*former
acts*’ means the demerit caused by evil deeds in the past. Or the
explanation of the two terms may be reversed (‘former acts’ standing for
*carelessness*, and ‘chance’ for *past misdeeds*).

‘*Mohāt*’ (‘through folly’) is another reading (for ‘*daivāt*’, ‘*by
chance*’); but what is meant is expressed by the term ‘*daiva*’,—(166)

‘*Daivāt* *pūrvakṛtena*’—‘In consequence of imprudence during present
life,—and in consequence of acts committed during previous existences’
(Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘by an enemy made formerly’
(Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 326).
