He should set in such a manner that others may not get the better of him
by means of the several expedients. This is the sum-total of
state-policy. This is a summing up.

In the manner shown above there is no inconsistency in the employment of
the ‘Six Measures’. It has to be borne in mind that if a king succeeds
(1) in keeping his plans secret, (2) in adopting remedial measures at
the advent of troubles, (3) in keeping his own circle contented, and (4)
in duly employing the measures and expedients,—then he attains success
in his affairs.—(181)
