‘*Pure*’—not covetous.

‘*True to his word*’—who attaches great importance to truth; who, in all
his acts, places truth in the fore-front; which means that he has his
senses under control; for how can there be any truthfulness in one whose
senses are not subdued?

‘*Who acts according to the Law*’,—‘*who has good assistants* whose
assistants are properly qualified; *i.e*., assisted by such assistants
as are not illiterate, and who are devoted to him.

‘*Wise*’—intelligent;—this is the reverse of the ‘demented’ person
mentioned in the preceding verse.

Thus he who is equipped with these five qualities, and free from the
corresponding five contrary qualities, is the person entitled to
administer punishment, and to partake of the visible (physical) and
invisible (moral) results proceeding therefrom. Such is the sense of
these two verses.—(31).

‘*Satyasandhaḥ*’—‘Regarding Truth as predominant’
(Medhātithi);—‘faithful to his promise’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 647);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 262).

*Gautama* (11.4).—‘The king shall be pure, of subdued senses, surrounded
by companions possessing excellent qualities and by the means of
upholding his rule.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.310).—‘He shall appoint ministers who are intelligent,
hereditarily connected, firm and pure.’

*Kāmandaka* (2.37).—‘inflicting extraordinarily heavy punishments, the
king frightens his people; and inflicting light ones, he ceases to be
feared. That king deserves praise who deals out punishment proportionate
to the offence.’
