प्रसन्न आराधनया श्रियं ददाति । क्रुद्धो मृत्युना योजयति । अतः श्रीकामेनाराधनीयः । न केवलं श्रिया योजयति, यावद् अस्य शत्रवः सन्ति तान् अपि पराक्रम्य परितोषितो हन्ति । अतः शत्रुवधकामेन यथावत् परिचरणीयः ।

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When he is pleased at service rendered to him, he grants wealth; when he
is angry, he inflicts death. Hence he who desires wealth should serve
him with care. When he is pleased with a man, he does not merely bestow
wealth on him, but also subdues and destroys his enemies. For this
reason also, if a man desires the destruction of his enemy, he should
try to please the King.

‘*Padma*;’—though this term is synonymous with ‘*Śri*’ (a name of the
Goddess of Fortune, yet in the present text it has been used in the
sense of *greatness*; t he sense being that the King bestows large
wealth.

All these things are obtained from the King, because ‘*he contains in
himself the splendour of all*’—*i.e*., of the Sun, the Moon and
Fire.—(11)

‘*Padmā*’—‘Carrying a lotus in her hand’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘dwelling in the
lotus (Rāghavānanda);—‘the great, the magnificent’ (Medhātithi,
Govindārāja and Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 18) which adds the following notes:—When a
man seeks for fortune, or having an enemy seeks to destroy him,—or seeks
for livelihood,—he has recourse to the king;—Medhātithi and others have
remarked that the term ‘*padmā*’ being a synonym of ‘*Śrī*’, is added
for the purpose of indicating *greatness*; that is to say, the term
‘*padmā*’ is superfluous;—in reality however it is ‘*padmā*’ that stands
as a name for the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, and the term ‘*śrīḥ*’
stands for ‘bodily splendour or we may construe the words as
follows:—‘In whose favours rests Padmā, the goddess of fortune, and in
whose valour rest resplendence (*śriḥ*) and victory (*vijayaḥ*).’
