villages, and in case of need, shall help them with his forces.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 250), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Anuparikrāmāt*’ *i.e*., wherever the lawful
people are being oppressed by unlawful people, he should strengthen the
former with his own forces;—‘*vṛttam*’ means ‘behaviour’;—‘*pariṇayet*’
means ‘report’; ‘*taccaraiḥ*,’ ‘through the king’s agents.’

ministers and then appoint spies, who shall go forth disguised as
*kāpālika* and the like.’

*Śukranīti* (1.751-752).—‘Every year the king should personally inspect
the villages, towns, cities, and districts and provinces and see which
people are happy and which oppressed by the officers, and investigate
cases brought up before him by the people.’

sentiments by conjecture and by external gestures, accurate of memory,
polite and soft in speech, agile in movements, capable of bearing up
with all sorts of privations and difficulties, ready-witted and expert
in all things,—such a person is fit to become a spy.’
