Every day he shall wait upon elderly persons, Brāhmaṇas, pure and learned in the Vedas; he who constantly waits upon elderly persons is honoured even by Rākṣasas.—(38)

‘*Elderly*’—aged—Brāhmaṇas. This alone is something new enjoined here;
all the rest of it, ‘Brāhmaṇas’ and so forth, is what has been already
declared before.

‘Pure’—free from defects. This also is something new; the meaning being
that ‘purity’ is as good a reason for being honoured as ‘knowledge and
learning.’

The second half of the verse is purely commendatory.

‘*By Rākṣasas*’—As a rule, *Rākṣasas* are pitiless, very powerful and
devoid of all virtues; and yet. even these honour the person who waits
upon elderly men.—(38).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 119), which adds
the following notes:—‘*vṛddhān*’ as ‘advanced in age, be they Brāhmaṇas
or non-Brāhmaṇas’;—‘*viprān*’ and ‘*vedavidaḥ*’ have been already
explained ‘*śucīn*’ is ‘free from guile’;—Medhātithi adds that this
qualification also is one that has not been mentioned elsewhere; but
Kullūka Bhaṭṭa holds that all the rest are only qualifications of
‘*viprān*’ \[so that Brāhmaṇas alone are meant\];—the meaning of the
second line is that ‘the king is respected also by those reckless,
merciless ruffians who are devoid of all virtues, not say by ordinary
people.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Kāmandaka* (1.60).—‘A king serving elderly persons is held in high
esteem by the pious; though induced by vile men, he commits no vile
deeds.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.77).—‘He should honour the aged.’

इमान् अपरान् विद्यावृद्धान् ब्राह्मणान् धर्मायैव केवलाय सेवेत । येन **वृद्धसेवी** न केवलं धर्मेण युज्यते, लोके ऽपि च विश्वसनीयतमो भवति । अतश् च **रक्षोभिर् अपि पूज्यते** इत्य् उच्यते ॥ ७.३८ ॥
