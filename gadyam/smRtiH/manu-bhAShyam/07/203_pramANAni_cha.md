<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

All the customs relating to the property of Brāhmaṇas or temples, and to
the duties of the people that may have been prevalent in the kingdom
from before,—all those he shall confirm, ‘*make authoritative*’. By so
doing, they become attached to him;—and the ‘lending men’ that may he
there,—their importance being due to their being rich in their
belongings and in the size of their family and such other
qualifications,—along with these, the new king shall be honoured with
presents of weapons, money, grains, ornaments, conveyances, umbrella,
throne, crown and so forth.—(203)

The next verse explains why precious gifts are to be made to the people.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 410), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Teṣām*,’ ‘of the other king,’—‘*yathoditān*,’ ‘as
handed down by his family-traditions,’—‘*dharmān*,’ ‘practices,
customs,’—these he should make the ‘*pramāṇāni*’, the *authority*, by
way of oath, *i.e*., he should administer the oath in such words as—‘if
you act contrary to this compact of yours, you fall off from such and
such high morality and custom handed down by your family-traditions.’—It
suggests also another explanation of the verse as as follows—‘*Teṣām*,’
‘of the former king’—‘*yathoditān dharmān*,’ ‘the administrative
measures taken for the grant of livings to Brāhmaṇas, ministers and
others,’—these he should ‘*pramāṇani kurvīta*,’ ‘declare to be
inviolable.’

It is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 73b).

*Yājñavalkya* (1.342).—‘When a country lias been conquered by the King,
he should preserve the observances, laws and customs of the place.’

*Arthaśāstra* (Trans. Shama Śastri, p. 491).—‘Having acquired new
territory, he should cover the enemy’s vices with his own virtues... by
strict observance of his own duties, by bestowing rewards, by remitting
taxes, by giving gifts and by bestowing honours. He should follow the
friends and leaders of the people... He should adopt the same mode of
life, the same dress, language and customs as those of the people.’

*Kāmandaka* (2.35).—‘A king protecting the Varṇas and Āśramas and living
according to their usages and knowing their duties, becomes worthy of
place in Indra’s heaven.’
