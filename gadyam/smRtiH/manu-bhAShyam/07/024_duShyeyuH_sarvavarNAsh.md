**दण्डस्य विभ्रमो** ऽकरणम् अन्यायेन वा करणम् । तस्मिन् सति **सर्ववर्णा दुष्येयुः**, इतरेतरस्त्रीगमनेन संकरप्रवृत्तेः । **सेतवो** मर्यादाः, ताः **सर्वा भिद्येरन्** । सर्वमर्यादापरिलोपः स्याद् इत्य् अर्थः । ब्राह्मणाश् च शूद्रवद् वर्तेरन्, शूद्राश् च ब्राःमणवत् । अतश् च **सर्वलोकप्रकोपः** स्यात् । त्रयो ऽपि लोका इतरेतरं वृष्ट्यातपादिना नोपकुर्युः ॥ ७.२४ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Mistakes regarding punishment*’—*i.e*., its non-infliction, or its
infliction in an unlawful manner. If there were any such, then ‘*all the
castes would become corrupt*’; as unrestricted intercourse would lead to
a confusion of castes.

‘*Barriers*’— bounds—‘*would be broken through*’;—all restrictions would
disappear; *Brāhmaṇas* would behave like *Śūdras* and *Śūdras* like
*Brāhmaṇas*. In this manner ‘*there would be disruption among all
regions*;—*i.e*., the three regions would not help each other by
imparting rain, heat and the rest.—(24)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 286), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Duṣyeyuḥ*’—‘men of the lower castes would have
intercourse with women of the higher ones and thus give birth to
improperly *mixed-castes* ’; and on this same account ‘all bounds of
propriety indicated by the scriptures would be broken down.’ It is
quoted again on p. 293;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 263), which
explains ‘*vibhrama*’ as ‘non-infliction’ or ‘wrong infliction’ (of
punishment).

*Śukranīti* (1.50).—‘The king should make his subjects acquire the habit
of sticking to their own duty; he himself should stick to his own
Dharma’
