For this reason no one should transgress that favourable decree which the King should ordain in favour of his favourites, or that unfavourable decree that he should ordain against those in his disfavour.—(13).

Because the King ‘contains within himself the splendour of all,’
therefore,—‘*in favour of his favourites*’— towards those ministers,
priests and others who are in favour,—whenever in course of business, a
‘*decree*’— an ordinance, in consonance with Law and Custom—is ordained
or issued by the King;—no one should transgress such a decree. Such a
decree of the King’s should not be disobeyed; such a decree for instance
us—‘To-day, the city should observe a holiday—there is a marriage in the
minister’s house,—all men should be present there,—no animals shall be
slaughtered to-day by the soldiers,—no birds are to be caught,—for so
many days dancing girls shall be entertained by all wealthy men.’

Similarly ‘*against those in disfavour*’,—such a decree as—‘no one shall
associate with this person,—no one should allow him to enter his house’.

When such decrees are issued by the King by the beat of drum etc. they
shall not be transgressed. But the King has no power to control the
ordinances pertaining to religions acts, such as. the *Agnihotra* and
the like, of the orders and castes. Such control would be repugnant to
other *Smṛti* texts; and the present text has its application, without
offending against any *Smṛti* text, in cases indicated above.—(13).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 23), which adds the following
notes:—Inasmuch as the king is the centre of all lustre and power, one
should never transgress any lawful and fair commands that his majesty
may issue in regard to his minister, priest or other favourites;—such
commands for instance as—‘To-day should be observed by all the people as
a day of rejoicing, there is a marriage in the minister’s house, all
should be present there, butchers shall kill no animals today, no birds
are to be caught, no debtors are to be imprisoned by their creditors’
and so forth \[these in regard to the king’s favourites.\]—Similarly in
regard to one whom he dislikes, he may issue such orders as—‘none shall
associate with him, he should not be permitted to enter any household,’
and so forth.—Such rules promulgated by the king should not be
disobeyed. In regard to the performance of the *Agnihotra* and such
religious acts, however, the king has no right to interfere at all.

This verse is quoted also in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 42b).
