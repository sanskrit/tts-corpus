It has been said that the other king should be ‘*powerful*’; the
question arising as to what amount of strength would mark him out as
‘powerful’,—the present verse supplies the answer.

With that king alone he shall seek shelter who is capable of chastising
the enemy’s forces, as also the disloyal subjects of the king seeking
his shelter.

And such a king shall he served like a preceptor; and in so doing the
king shall not consider his dignity at all; he should have no such
notion as ‘he also is a great king, so I shall treat him as my equal’;
in fact he shall be attended upon, like a master.

‘*With every effort*’— by all such means as saying agreeable things,
attending on him, and so forth.—(175)
