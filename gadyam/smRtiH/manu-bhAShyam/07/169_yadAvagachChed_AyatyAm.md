‘Future’ is time to come.

When he knows that ‘this king is equal to me in strength—or I may be
weaker now, but in time, by creating disunion among his people, or by
entering into powerful alliances, I shall be able to defeat him’,—then
he should make peace.

‘*Superiority*’ means *possession of superior force*.

‘*Certain*’— sure.

‘*At the time*’— this phrase denotes the *present time*.—(169)
