This text is meant to assert that only a small tax shall be levied upon
the person whose agricultural holding is not prosperous.

‘*Water-insect*’— leech.

‘*Ṣaṭpada*’—The black bee.

Just as these derive full nourishment by taking in only a little food,
similarly the King should not uproot his people (by overtaxing
them).—(128)

The order of verses 128 and 129 of Medhātithi is reversed in the other
commentaries and hence by Buhler and Burnell.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 404);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 260), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Adanti*’, ‘eat’;—‘*ādyam*,’ ‘what is fit for eating, *i.e*.,
blood, milk and honey’;—‘*vāryoko-vatsa-ṣaṭpadāḥ*,’ ‘the leech, the calf
and the bee’;—in the same manner should the king draw from his kingdom
only a small amount of annual revenue, so that the principal capital of
the people may not be affected.

**(verses 7.128-129)  
**

*Baudhāyana* (1.18.15).—‘He shall levy equitable duties on other
marketable goods according to their intrinsic value, without causing
oppression.’

*Āpastamba* (2.26.9).—‘The king shall make them collect the lawful
taxes.’

*Mārkaṇḍeya* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 404).—‘Just as during eight months of
the year the sun draws out moisture, gently through his rays,—so should
the king collect the taxes by gentle methods.’
