‘*Sādhayet kāryamātmanaḥ*’ is another reading for the last quarter of
the verse.

‘*The employer of the Expedients*’—*i.e*. himself; having obtained
himself, he shall accomplish his purpose, as if he were his own friend.

‘*All expedients*’— collectively and severally.

‘*The end to be attained*’— this also refers to all kinds of business in
general.

‘*Taking his stand upon*’— having resorted to; this *resorting to* is
accomplished by pondering over them,—as to whether the expedients are
efficient enough, what would be the proper thing to do, by what means is
such and such end to be attained,—all this be shall duly ponder over.

‘*All*’— refers to ‘*the three*’,—and means *entirely*.

The meaning thus comes to be that—‘for the accomplishment of his purpose
he shall employ that particular expedient which may be capable of
accomplishing it’.

As a matter of fact, the ends to be attained by means of the Expedients
are endless in number; so that it is not possible to mention them all in
detail; and hence they have been mentioned briefly and collectively. And
all this shall be duly pondered over. It is with reference to the
peculiar nature of the ends that it has been declared as follows:—

‘The careful man makes peace; the careful man has recourse to his own
prowess; both these should be equipped with statesmanship, without which
one would be as good as a thief.’—(215)

‘*Upetāram*’—‘The employer of the means, *i.e*., the king himself’
(Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda);—‘the
king’s minister’ (Nandana).

‘*Āśritya*’—‘Undertaking’ (Medhātithi);—‘depending upon’ (Govindarāja
and Kullūka);—‘pondering over’ (Nārāyaṇa and Raghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 413), which
explains ‘*upetāram*’ as ‘the employer of the means, *i.e*., the king
himself,’—and ‘*upeyam*’ as ‘one who is to be won by the means employed,
*i.e*., the enemy’—again, on p. 319, where also the explanations are
repeated;—and in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 50).

*Arthaśāstra* (Part II, pp. 248 and 343).—‘He may have recourse to the
methods, either singly or severally or collectively and win over the
subjects.’
