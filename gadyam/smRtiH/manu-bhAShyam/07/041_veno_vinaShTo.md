In support of both assertions they cite instances of well-known Kings.
The stories of these Kings are to be learnt from the *Mahābhārata*.—(41)

VERSE (42)

But through discipline pṛthu and manu obtained kingdoms, kubera obtained
the lordship of wealth and the son of gādhi attained brāhmaṇahood.—(42)

‘*The son of Gadhi* (*Gādhi*?) *attained Brāhmaṇahood*.’—

*Objection*—“*In* connection with the subject of Kings and kingdoms,
where was the occasion for citing an instance of the attaining of
*Brāhmaṇahood?* It was necessary to cite cases of the obtaining of
kingdoms only, as was done in the first half of the verse.”

Our answer is that as a matter of fact a higher caste is more difficult
to attain than sovereignty over riches; because the higher caste carries
with it all its privileges.

*Objection*— “But how can, *vinaya*, discipline, be the cause of that?
‘Discipline’ consists in such qualifications as—the proper employment of
the six means of success, alertness, thrift, non-avariciousness, freedom
from evil habits, and so forth; and not

“Vena is often taken as a type of an undisciplined king. He was the son
of Sunīthā and father to Pṛthu......Nahuṣa, son of Āyuṣ (the Mahābhārata
I and V), was ruined by love and ambition... Sudās was king at the time
of the great Vaśiṣṭha, and a leader of the Tṛtsu (Ṛgveda VII. 18)...
Sumukha is unknown to me. Nimi is said to be a Videha king”—Hopkins.

Gharpure notes the following references to the *Mahābhārata*;—(1)
Droṇaparva (69);—(2) Śāntiparva (28-137, 58-102);—(3) Ādiparva (63-5,
69-29);—(4) Udyogaparva (101-12);—(5) Bhīṣmaparva (6-14);—(6)
Sabhā-parva (8-9). These are meant to refer respectively to the six
kings mentioned in the text.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 119), which notes
that Sudāsa was the son of Paijavana.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Gautama* (It. 3).—‘The king shall be fully instructed in the threefold
science and in Logic.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1. 310).—‘Fully instructed in Logic, in Political
Science, in Agricultural Science and in the Threefold Science (Vedas).’

*Arthasāstra* (pp. 34-35).—‘The discipline of the sciences is obtained
through the authority of the professors of each; for the sake of this
discipline one should always remain in constant touch with those learned
in the sciences.’

*Kāmandaka* (1.59,03,66).—‘Association with the Preceptor bestows
knowledge of the scriptures; knowledge of the scriptures increases
humility. A king who is modest under culture never sinks under
calamities. A king well-versed in polity, practising self-control, very
soon attains to that shining pitch of prosperity that has been attained
by other divine kings. The Preceptor is worshipped for the acquisition
of learning; learning which has been mastered becomes instrumental in
enhancing the prudence of the illustrious; and the habit of acting by
prudence leads to prosperity.’
