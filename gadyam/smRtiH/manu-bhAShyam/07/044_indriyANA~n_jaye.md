Day and night he shall put forth an effort to subdue his senses; because he whose senses are subjugated is capable of keeping his subjects under control.—(41)

इन्द्रियजयस्य ब्रह्मचारिधर्मेषु सर्वपुरुषार्थतयोपदिष्टस्य पुनर् इहोपदेशो राजधर्मेषु मुख्यो ऽयं विनय इति ज्ञापयितुम् । तद् इदम् आह **जितेन्द्रिय** इत्यादि । सर्वस्यैतत् प्रसिद्धम्- अजितेन्द्रियस्य न प्रजा वशे तिष्ठन्ति । **योगस्** तात्पर्यं । **दिवानिशम्** अहोरात्रम् ॥ ७.४४ ॥

Though the subjugation of the senses has been already enjoined among the
‘Duties of Students’ as beneficial for all men, yet it is again
reiterated among the ‘Duties of Kings’ with a view to indicate that this
forms an important factor in their training.

This is what is meant by the words—‘he *whose senses are subjugated* &c.
&c.’ It is a fact well known to all men that one whose senses are not
subdued does not succeed in keeping his subjects under control.

‘*Effort*’—intense exertion.

‘*Day and night*’—Daring the day as well as during the night.—(44)

*Kāmandaka* (1.62).—‘The prosperity of a king who keeps his passion
under control and who follows the path chalked out by the Science of
Government always shines; his fame also reaches the heavens.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 37).—‘The control of the senses is at the root of
learning and discipline; this control should he acquired by the
abandonment of desires, anger, greed, pride, vanity and pleasure. The
control of the senses consists in avoiding the improper activities of
the Auditory, Tactile, Visual, Gustatory and Olfactory organs towards
their respective objects, sound, touch, colour, taste and odour; or it
may consist in making them act according to the scriptures; the whole
purpose of the scriptures lies in the control of the senses.’

*Śukranīti* (1.301).—‘Of the monarch who has conquered his senses and
who follows the Nītiśāstra, prosperity is in the ascendant and fame
reaches the skies.’

*Kāmandaka* (5.36).—‘A king, conversant with notions of justice and
injustice, having subdued his mind already powerless through the
subjugation of the senses, should exert himself for realising his own
good.’

044	Day and night he must strenuously exert himself to conquer his senses; for he (alone) who has conquered his own senses, can keep his subjects in obedience.
