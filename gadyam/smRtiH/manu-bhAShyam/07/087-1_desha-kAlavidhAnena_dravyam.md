     G takes this verse as part of Manu asigning it the number 87, while J (correctly, I think) takes it as Medhātithi's citation: see the commentary on pretya at the end. It is not found in my critical editon of the MDh. Thus from this point there is a discrepancy in the numbering in G and J. DK also seem to take the verse as Manu's and places the section (pretyeti ... until the end) BEFORE this verse.


तत्र देशः स्वनिवासदेशाद् अन्यो जानपदः । दूरदेशप्रोषितायां संनिहितत्वाद् दत्तम् अस्य हेतुर् उपघातः । यज्ञप्रवृत्तस्य केनचिद् अङ्गेन न्यूनता । (कालः ?) ग्रहोपराग इत्य् एवमादिः । विधानम् । उदकपूर्वकस्वस्तिवाचनसंस्कारतिशयो भावप्रसाद[^११७] इत्यादि । द्रव्यं गोभूहिरण्यादि । श्रद्धा प्राप्त्यभिलाषातिशयः, कथम् इदं मे निवर्तेति बुद्धिसंतानः ।

Here ‘*place*’ stands for the ‘right place’, which is that which is
other than the village inhabited by the giver himself; people away from
their homes are likely to be subject to many inconveniences and wants,
which may he removed by the gift;—‘*Time*’—when some one who is
performing a sacrifice happens to run short of necessary supplies; or
when an eclipse takes place; ‘*Form*’—the pouring of water, the
pronouncing of the syllable ‘*Svasti*’ by the recipient, the proper
preparation of the substance given away, the sweetness of disposition
with which the gift is made; and so forth;

‘*Substance*’— cow, land, gold and so forth.

‘*Faith*’—a keen desire for fulfilment, the determination as to ‘how
this may be accomplished.’

‘*After death*.’—This only indicates that the reward does not always
follow immediately after the act of giving; it does not mean that it
accrues always during the next life; specially as all that is meant in
the case of all acts enjoined in the Veda is that they must bring their
reward (and nothing is indicated regarding the time at which the reward
is to accrue).—(86)
