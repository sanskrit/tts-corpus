Having come out of the inner apartment, he shall robe himself and
‘*inspect the fighting men*’—*i.e*. receive their
salutes;—‘*again*’—even though he may have inspected them in the
morning, yet he shall inspect them again, every day. ‘*Āyudhīya*’—those
who live by their weapons and are, consequently, very careful regarding
them.

‘*All kinds of conveyances*’;—‘the inspection of these leads to their
improvement, and makes the men in charge of them careful regarding their
charge. Such supervision of servants is to be accompanied by proper
punishments and rewards(?)—(222)
