<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

One should never think that the King is his relation or friend. ‘To whom
is the King ever a friend, and who are friends to the King?’ (as the
saying goes).

Under the exigencies of business, Kings treat a friend as their enemy,
or an enemy as their friend. Similarly when they feel that they are not
sufficiently strong, they condone faults; and as soon as they feel
strong enough, they destroy the culprit. Similarly he acts according to
the exigencies of time and place.

Thus ‘*for the due fulfilment of hie duty*’—*i.e*., for the
accomplishment of his business —‘*he assumes many forms*’. In a moment
he becomes a friend, and in a moment an enemy; the King never remains
uniform.

For this reason one should never trust the King; that is, either by
reason of friendship, or of kindness, or of good nature, or of sameness
of age, one should not behave towards him as an equal. He should always
be treated with caution.—(10)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392); in the same
work (Vyavahāra, p. 6);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 18), which
adds the following notes:—‘*Kāryam*’ means ‘fitness for being pardoned
or punished’,—‘*śakti*’ is ‘capacity’,—‘*deśa*’ means ‘remoteness or
proximity’,—‘*kālam*’ refers to times of scarcity or opulence;—having
considered all this, he assumes various forms;—*i*. *e*., in a moment he
is pleased, and in a moment displeased; when he finds a man weak, he
becomes forgiving and if the man is strong, he uproots him, *i.e*., he
assumes a friendly, inimical or disinterested attitude in accordance
with the considerations of state.
