‘There’—in that hall—‘*staying*’,—‘*he shall welcome*’— gratify with
proper forms of address, looks, marks of respect and salutation—‘*the
subjects*’— who happen to come to see him,—‘*and then send them
away*’,—permit them to go as they had come.

Then, often the people have been sent off, ‘*he shall take counsel with
his ministers*’,—discussing what should be done in connection with
matters relating to his own kingdom and that of other Kings. The five
requisites of ‘Counsel’ are now described.

Those requisites of ‘counsel’ are as follows:—The means of undertaking a
project, (2) the supply of men and material, (3) due apportionment of
place and time, (4) remedy for miscarriage, and (5) success of the
project.

What the verse means is that the King shall not trespass upon the time
for listening to the prayers of the people. It is possible that the
sitting of the council may be prolonged; and of this he shall not apeak
to the men; he shall keep his counsel secret.—(146)

Court’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 61).

the histories for a little while and then look into the suits of the
suitors.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 158).—‘In the forenoon, seated
in the Court, he shall see the aged men, the ministers and his
dependants and also the gods; thereafter he shall listen to the
law-scriptures.’
