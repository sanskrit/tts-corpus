‘*Undertakings*’— Business affairs. When any work is going to be
undertaken, he shall consider its ‘*future*’—*i.e*., its developments to
come,—and also its ‘*present condition*’,—*i.e*., its condition at the
beginning,—‘*fully*’— in all its real details. As a matter of fact,
undertakings have several offshoots, and undergo transformation in a
moment; so that if both ends (future and present) of an undertaking are
not dearly grasped, it is difficult to ascertain in what manner it shall
be proceeded with; hence the necessity of consi d eration, which the
present text enjoins.

‘*Also the good and bad points of all past ones*’—shall then be pondered
over. Here also having thought over the good and bad points of past
actions, one has to make up his mind to undertake first those which are
found to have only good points; and brain lies the use of thinking over
the good and bed points of past acts,—which are enjoined in the present
text—(178)
