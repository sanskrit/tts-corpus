The ‘*last watch*’ stands for the ‘*Brāhma-muhūrta*’, the ‘time sacred
to Brahman’; that it is so is indicated by the terms ‘*having performed
his ablutions*’, and ‘*with collected mind*’.

‘*Having poured the libations into Fire*’;—the performance of this act
of Homa-offering is not to be done during the ‘*Brahma-muhūrta*’; ince
at that time *four muhūrtas* (3 hours, 12 minutes) of the night would be
still left, while the Homa-offering has been laid down as to be done
when the night has dawned. So what all this means is simply—‘having
accomplished all that is to be done at dawn’.

‘*Having honoured*’ worshipped—‘*the Brāhmaṇas*’—‘*he shall enter the
auspicious Hall of Audience*’—equipped with auspicious marks.—(145)

*Smṛtyantara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 155).—‘Rising during the last
quarter of the night, he shall cleanse his teeth; then entering the
bath-room, he shall bathe with purified water; thereupon having offered
water to the Sun-god with collected mind, he shall adorn his body, and
having looked at his face with a *mantra*, he shall give to the Brāhmaṇa
a pot of clarified butter along with gold.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 158).—‘Everyday on rising the
king shall honour the gods and Brāhmaṇas; he shall then worship the
Fire.’

and domestic priests and the teacher, he shall see the astrologers and
physicians and then give away cows, gold and land.’
