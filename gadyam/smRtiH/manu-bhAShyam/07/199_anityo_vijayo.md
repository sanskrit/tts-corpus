यस्मान् नायं नियमो दृश्यते- यो जयति सो ऽत्यन्तबलवान् अवश्यम्, तेन यश् च पराजीयते सो ऽत्यन्तं दुर्बलश् चावश्यम् इति, **अनित्यो विजयः** ॥ ७.१९९ ॥

Because it is not always founed (found?) to be the case that he who
gains the victory is necessarily the stronger of the two combatants,—or
that he who is defeated by him is necessarily the weaker,—therefore
‘*victory is uncertain*’.—(199).
