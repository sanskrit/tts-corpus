To the ‘*inferior servant*’—*i.e*., to one who is employed in such work
as sweeping and cleaning; for his living one *paṇa* should be paid.

To the superior servant shall also be given *Clothing every sixth
month*’; and also ‘a *Droṇa of grain*’; a ‘*droṇa*’ is equal to four
*Ādhakas*.

The exact measure of the ‘*paṇa*’ the author is going to describe later
on (8.136).

These verses are meant to prescribe the wages of the servants.—(126)

‘*Paṇa*’—See 8.136.

‘*Droṇa*’—‘Four *āḍhakas*, *i.e*., 10 seers’ (Medhātithi and
Kullūka);—‘512 *palas*’ (Govindarāja).

“Govindarāja and Kullūka state that the highest servants shall receive
six times as much grain and clothes as the lowest, and the middle class
servants three times as much as the lowest”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 252), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Avakṛṣṭasya*,’ ‘of domestic
servants’;—‘*vetanam*,’ fooding,—‘*āchādaḥ*’, ‘two pieces of
clothing’,—‘*droṇaḥ* ‘four ‘*Āḍhakas*’;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 240).
