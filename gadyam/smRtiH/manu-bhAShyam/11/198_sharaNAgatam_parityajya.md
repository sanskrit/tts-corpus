The ‘*refugee*’ is of two kinds, as described above (under
190),—‘*abandoning*’—discarding of him, if one is able to afford him
protection (is sinful). This has been discussed before.

‘*Tampered with the Veda*’—(*a*) Has studied it on a day on which it
should not be studied;—or (*b*) has interfered with a man who is reading
it in the correct form, by telling him some such tiling as—‘What are you
reading?—You have mangled the text,’—or (*c*) through greed for wealth
recites it, without being invited to do so. The Smṛti has declared
that—‘by reciting the Veda for gain one becomes degraded, says
Manu.’—(198)

‘*Vedam viplāvya*.’—‘Having taught the Veda to people who should not be
taught’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and Nandana);—‘having wrongly
interpreted the Veda or perverted its sense by omitting *anusvāras*
etc.’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘having intentionally forgotten the Veda’
(Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 918), which adds the
following notes:—If the man abandons one who comes to him seeking safety
from some danger, or for the prescription of an expiation,—‘*Vedam
viplāvya*,’ *i.e*., reading it within hearing of the Cāṇḍāla or other
snob persons, or on days unfit for study.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1152), to the effect that when a man
comes to one in the hope of obtaining shelter for his life, and the
latter, though capable of saving him, refuses to do so,—similarly one
who reads the Veda from an improper person, or in an improper place, or
at an improper time,—or learns it from or teaches it to an unqualified
person,—both these should live on barley for one year.
