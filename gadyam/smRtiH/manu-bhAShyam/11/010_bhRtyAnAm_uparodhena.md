If a man does anything for his own benefit after death, to the detriment of the persons he has got to maintain,—it becomes conducive to unhappy results while he lives as also when he dies.—(9). Aged parents, well-behaved wife and infant sons have been declared by Manu to be persons that should be maintained, even by doing a hundred evil acts.—(10)


वृद्धौ च मातापितरौ साध्वी भार्या शिशुः सुतः | 
अप्यकार्यशतं कृत्वा भर्तव्या मनुरब्रवीत् ||


vṛddhau ca mātāpitarau sādhvī bhāryā śiśuḥ sutaḥ | 
apyakāryaśataṃ kṛtvā bhartavyā manurabravīt ||

**(verses 11.9-10)  
**

This is a deprecatory declamation in support of what has gone before.

‘*Persons he has got to maintain*’—already described.

‘*Detriment*’— depriving them of food and clothing and other
necessaries.

‘*For his benefit after death*’—For the purpose of accomplishing for
himself rewards in the other world.

‘*Conducive to unhappy results*’— The ‘*Udarka*,’ *i.e*., the ‘future
result’ of such giving turns out to be ‘unhappy’.—(9-10).

\[Verse 10 translated here has been quoted by Medhātithi in the Bhāṣya
on 3.72.\]

**(verse 11.9)**

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 283);—and in *Hemādri* (Dāna p.
40).

\[note: the above note either belongs to verse 8 or 9\]

**(verse 11.10)**

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 283).

> वृद्धौ च मातापितरौ साध्वी भार्या शिशुः सुतः \|  
> अप्यकार्यशतं कृत्वा भर्तव्या मनुरब्रवीत् \|\|

> vṛddhau ca mātāpitarau sādhvī bhāryā śiśuḥ sutaḥ \|  
> apyakāryaśataṃ kṛtvā bhartavyā manurabravīt \|\|

This verse is not commented upon by the Commentators; it is quoted by
Medhātithi under 2.189, and in several important *Nibandhas*.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 283);—in *Mitākṣarā* (1.224) to the
effect that one who abandons his wife and children stands on the same
footing as one who abandons his parents;—again on 2.175, as. indicating
the obligatory character of the duty of maintaining one’s
family-members;—the *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following notes:—‘*Vṛddhau*’,
over 80 years old,—‘*śiśuḥ*’, less than 16 years old,—‘*Akāryaśatam*’,
many such reprehensible acts as receiving improper gifts and so forth.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* I (p. 349);—in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 361)
as mentioning persons who must be supported;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra
p. 186);—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 384), which adds that
this refers to abnormal times of distress.

**(verses 11.9-10)**

*Śātātapa* (Aparārka, p. 283).—‘The twice-born person who, in feeding
and making gifts, passes over the student near at hand destroys his
family to the seventh generation.’

*Bhaviṣyapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘If one passes over the Brāhmaṇa near at
hand,—except when he is an outcast,—and feeds one at a distance, he
falls into hell.—For this reason, the wise man should never pass over
his neighbours and relations, or his daughter’s son or sister’s husband,
or his sister’s son specially, and other relations; he should not pass
over these even if they be illiterate; passing over them, one falls into
hell.’

*Vyāsa* (Do., p. 282).—‘What is given to one’s parents, brothers,
sisters or daughters, wife or sons,—becomes an irreproachable bridge to
heaven. A gift made to the father becomes a hundredfold, that to the
mother a thousandfold, that to the daughter becomes endless, and what is
given to the uterine brother is imperishable.’

*Dakṣa* (Do., p. 939).—‘The following are the persons that should be
supported by rich persons:—father, mother, teacher, wife, children, a
poor man seeking shelter, guest and fire; also relations that are poor,
an orphan seeking shelter. He shall make presents to learned
men......... The supporting of one’s dependants is the way to heaven,
and the harassing of them is the way to hell.’

010	If (a man) does anything for the sake of his happiness in another world, to the detriment of those whom he is bound to maintain, that produces evil results for him, both while he lives and when he is dead.
