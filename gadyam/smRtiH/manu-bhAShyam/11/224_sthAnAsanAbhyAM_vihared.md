He shall remain either seated or standing; he shall not lie down
anywhere.

But if ho is unable to do so, ‘*he may lie down on the bare
ground*,’—not on a couch,

‘*Chaste*’—avoiding sexual intercourse.

‘*Firm in his vows*’—Against all that is deprecated by the cultured, he
shall take the vow—‘I shall not do this.’

The ‘*worshipping*’ of the elders and the rest shall consist in offering
to them, with due humility, garlands, sandal-paint and such
things.—(224)
