If one associates with an outcast for one year, he himself becomes an outcast; not by sacrificing for him, or teaching him, or forming a matrimonial alliance with him,—but by walking, sitting or eating.—(180)

     This cannot be right. The word is probably: brahmaghnādayaḥ; reference is to the four mahāpatakins mentioned in the previous verse.

The term ‘outcast’ connotes disqualification in regard to the rites of
twice-born men; the meaning is that he ‘falls,’ recedes, becomes
deprived of, his rights.

‘*Outcasts*,’—of the four castes, Brāhmaṇa and the rest;—‘*if one
associates with* them—*in one year he becomes an outcast*,’ he becomes
equal to the outcast.

What is it that he is supposed to do when ‘associating?’

‘*Walking, sitting and eating*’—(*a*) ‘walking’ means conversing,
touching the body and moving about in his company; similarly (*b*)
‘sitting,’ on the same bed, or on the same seat; and (*c*) ‘eating,’ on
the same seat, or out of the same dish.

‘*Sacrificing*, *teaching and forming matrimonial alliance*,’—it is with
these that ‘*not*’ has to be construed.

It becomes necessary to explain whether, by^(‘)sacrificing’ for an
outcast, one does not become an outcast at all, or he becomes so in more
or less than a year.

On the basis of other *Smṛti* -texts it is understood that by
sacrificing for an outcast, one becomes an outcast *immediately*.

The right reading would be^(‘)*yājanādhyāpanam*,’ with the Accusative
ending;—as the nouns are meant to be governed by the present-participle
term^(‘)*ācaran*,’ which also indicates the reason for what is here laid
down (for the purpose of the indication whereof the Ablative has been
used).—(180)

“Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa explain the verse differently:—‘He who
associates with an outcast by sacrificing for him, or by forming a
matrimonial alliance with him, himself becomes an outcast after a year,
but not by using the same carriage or seat, or eating with
him’.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 849), which explains the
meaning as follows:—‘By associating with an outcast on conveyances,
seats and dinners after one year,—but by associating with him in
sacrificing, teaching and the like, he becomes an outcast, not after one
year, but immediately

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1087), which offers the following
explanation:—By associating in any way with a known outcast, himself
becomes an outcast; that is, becomes like him;—there are some acts in
which associating with the outcast makes one an outcast, irrespective of
all other considerations; and such acts are ‘sacrificing, teaching and
marrying’; each of these acts by itself makes the associator an
outcast;—the acts of going on the same conveyance, sitting together and
eating, on the other hand, do not by themselves make him an outcast;
they do so through other acts.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (8.261), as meaning that only such acts as
those of ‘travelling together and so forth’ make one an outcast by being
continued for one year;—it adds that ‘sitting’ includes ‘sleeping’ also.
It remarks that the passage is to be construed as
follows:—‘*Saṃvatsareṇa patati patitena sahācaran yānāsanāśanāt*’; and
‘*Yājanādhyāpanādyaunāt na tu saṃvatsareṇa patati, kintu sadya eva*’;
and concludes thus—‘By sacrificing and other acts the man becomes an
outcast at once, while by sleeping and other acts he becomes so only by
continuing it for one year’.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka*, (pp. 149 and 156), which construes
‘*Yāṇāṣanāśanāt*’ as ‘*Yānasanāśanāt utpannam saṃyogam ācaran*’,—and
adds that these three, when done all together and intentionally, do
degrade the man.

*Mahābhārata* (12.165.37).—(Same as Manu.)

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.35).—‘He who associates with an outcast, by using the
same carriage or seat with him, becomes an outcast in one year; not so
by sacrificing for him, or teaching him, or forming a matrimonial
alliance with him.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.22).—‘They quote the following:—“He who during a year
associates with an outcast becomes an outcast; not by sacrificing for
him, or teaching him, or forming a matrimonial alliance with him, but by
using the same carriage or seat.”’

*Gautama* (21, 3).—‘He who associates for a year with outcasts (becomes
an outcast).’

*Viṣṇu* (35.3-5).—‘He who associates with an outcast becomes an outcast
himself after one year; and so does he who rides in the same carriage
with him, or who eats in his company, or who sits on the same bench, or
who lies on the same couch with him. Matrimonial intercourse,
sacrificial intercourse or vocal intercourse with an outcast entails
immediate loss of caste.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.261).—‘He who associates with these (outcasts) for one
year, himself becomes equal to them.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 1086).—‘If a man knowingly lives with an outcast
for one year, he becomes mingled with him, and at the end of the year,
becomes an outcast himself. Sacrificing for the outcast, forming
matrimonial connections with him, teaching him, eating with him,—doing
these one becomes an outcast immediately.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do.).—‘Occupying the same seat or couch with an outcast,
sitting in the same line with him, mixing up one’s cooked food with his,
using the same vessels, sacrificing for him, teaching him, going on the
same conveyance with him, eating with him; these are the nine forms of
*association*; this should not he done with low men.’

*Parāśara* (Do., p. 1088).—‘The Brāhmaṇa unintentionally forming
connections with outcasts becomes equal to him, either in five days, or
ten days, or twelve days, or half-a-year, or one year.’
