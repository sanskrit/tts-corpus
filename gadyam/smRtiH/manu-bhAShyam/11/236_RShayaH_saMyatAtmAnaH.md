<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

What this means is that it is due to Austerity that sages acquire the
power to have super-sensuous cognitions.

‘*Self-controlled*’—by the restraint of speech, mind and body.

‘*Fruits and roots*’—stands for restraints on food.

By means of this Austerity, they survey, as if by direct perception, the
whole of the three worlds.—(236)
