The expiation here laid down is for the stealing of grass and other
things, in such quantities, as would be more valuable than the
‘conveyance’ and other things mentioned in the preceding verse,

‘*Wood*’— hot made into any article. That this is what is meant follows
from its occurring along with ‘trees.’

‘*Druma*’ is tree.

‘*Dry food*’—either rice, or fried barley.

‘*Molasses*.’— This stands for things made of molasses; so that
sugarcandy and other sweetmeats become included.

‘*Caila*’ is *cloth*;—*i.e*., of large quantities of valuable cloth.

The expiation here laid down is an optional alternative to the *Kṛcchra*
that would be necessary in accordance with what is laid down in Verse
163, where the stealing of ‘wealth’ (which includes cloth) has been
dealt with.

‘*Leather*’ stands here for *armour*.

‘*Māṃsa*’—meat.—(166)

This is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), which adds that since the
expiation here prescribed is thrice as heavy ns that prescribed in the
proceeding verse, the ‘grass’ and other things mentioned here should be
taken to be of that quantity which would be obtainable at a price three
times that of the single meal.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1110), which notes that this refers to
the stealing of ‘grass’ and other things whose value is three times that
of the single meal of one man;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 875);—and in
*Prāyaścittviveka* (p. 345), which explains ‘*Śuṣkānna*’ as ‘rice &c.’,
and adds that the ‘two days penance’ is for stealing grains sufficient
for two meals, for stealing more than that, there should be heavier
expiation.
