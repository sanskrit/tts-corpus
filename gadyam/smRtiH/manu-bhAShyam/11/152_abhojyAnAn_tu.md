Those persons are said to be ‘*of unfit food*’ whose food people do not
eat; *i.e*., those ignorant of the Veda, those who make a living by
their wife, those who live upon war, those who sacrifice for persons not
entitled to sacrifice, and so forth.

Since the term ‘*Śūdra*’ itself, which stands for both sexes, would
include the Śūdra woman also,—the term ‘*woman*’ should be understood to
stand for a woman of the same caste as the person concerned.

‘*Left*’—means *touched by the mouth*.

As for the assertion that ‘the mouth of women is always pure’ (5.130),
the exact scope of that has been already explained.

In connection with the drinking of water *left by a Śūdra*, a previous
text (149) has laid down the ‘drinking of Kuśa-water,’ while the present
text prescribes the drinking of ‘barley’ for seven days. And since the
matter is a purely scriptural one, what is said in the present verse
should be taken as referring to the eating of such food as *cooked rice*
and the like.

‘*Forbidden flesh*’— of such birds, for instance, as the *Plava*, the
*Haṃsa*, the *Cakravāka* and the like.

What is here prescribed should be understood as referring to cases where
the act is repeatedly and intentionally done. For other cases, the
expiation would be the general one that—‘in the case of the rest, one
should fast for the day.’

This same expiation also applies to the case of the drinking of all
kinds of *forbidden milk*, with the exception of the milk of the sow,
the camel and such other animals,—in connection with which special
expiations have been directly prescribed.

When one drinks the ‘gruel’ (of barley), it becomes the *drinking* *of*
‘*barley*.’—(152)

[*Cf*.
4.222.]

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1167);—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.291),
which adds that *this refers to* intentional and repeated acts;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 269 and 281), which says that this refers to
*unintentional* eating.

See above under
[4.222].

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14. 33).—‘For eating garlic, onions, mushrooms, turnips,
śleṣmātaka, exudations from trees, the red sap flowing from incisions in
trees, food peeked at by crows or carried by dogs, or the leavings of a
Śūdra, an *Atikṛcchra* penance must be performed.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.50, 54, 56).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa eats the leavings of a Śūdra, he
should subsist on milk for seven days. If a Kṣatriya eats the leavings
of a Śūdra, he should subsist on milk for five days. If a Vaiśya eats
the leavings of a Śūdra, he should subsist on milk for three days.’
