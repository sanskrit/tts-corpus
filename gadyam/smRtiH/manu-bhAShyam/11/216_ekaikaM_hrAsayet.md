If one reduces his food by one morsel daily during the dark half of the month, and increases it during the light half,—bathing at the three ‘extractions,’—it is what has been called the ‘Cāndrāyaṇa.’—(216)

Having fasted on the fourteenth day, on the next day, or the Full
moon-day, he shall take fifteen morsels; the exact measure of the
‘morsel’ in this connection should be understood to be as mentioned in
another *Smṛti* (Gautama, 27.10), the words ‘*āpyāyasra*...... the
measure of the *morsel* being the quantity that does not distort the
face.’ As all the *Smṛtis* deal with the same subject, they should be
taken as mutually complementary, so long as there is no inconsistency;
and in cases of inconsistency, the two views should he taken as optional
alternatives.

Beginning with the first again, be shall reduce his food by one morsel
each day,—taking fourteen morsels on the first, thirteen on the second,
and so on, till on the fourteenth he takes only one morsel. Then having
fasted on the New-moon day (the fifteenth), he shall cat only one morsel
on the first, two on the second, and so on increasing it by one morsel
everyday, till it comes to fifteen on the Full-moon day.

‘*Upaspṛśan*’—bathing.

‘*At the three extractions*’—*i.e*., in the morning, at midday and in
the evening. This precludes the general rule that ‘the man shall bathe
thrice during the night,’—the present being a special rule.—(216)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 240), as
laying down the ‘three times bathing’ as part of the ‘*Cāndrāyāṇa*’
penance;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 742), where ‘*triṣavaṇam*’ is explained
as the three ‘*sandhyās*’, morning, evening and mid-day;—in *Aparārka*
(p. 1243), which adds that this penance is called ‘barley-shaped’ and
‘ant-shaped’, the latter when it is begun on the first day of the darker
fortnight;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 516).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (23.45).—‘On the first day of the dark half of the month, let
him eat fourteen mouthfuls, and diminish the number by one daily, till
the end of the fortnight; in like manner, let him eat one mouthful on
the first day of the light half of the month and daily increase the
number by one, till the end of the fortnight.’

Do. (27.21).—‘Let him add daily one mouthful to his food during the
bright half of the month, let him diminish it daily by one mouthful
during the dark half, and let him fast on the moonless day; that is the
rule for the *Cāndrāyaṇa*.’

*Parāśara* (10.2).—(Same as Manu.)

*Gautama* (27.12-13).—‘On the full-moon day, he shall eat fifteen
mouthfuls, and during the dark half of the month daily diminish his
portion by one mouthful; he shall fast on the moonless day, and during
the bright half of the month daily increase his portion by one mouthful.
According to some, it should be the other way. That is a month occupied
by the *Cāndrāyaṇa* penance.’

*Baudhāyana* (3.8, 19-27; also, 4.517).—‘On the first day of the latter
half of the month, he eats fourteen mouthfuls; thus he takes every day
one mouthful less, up to the moonless day; on the moonless day there is
not even a mouthful to be taken; on the first day of the first half of
the month one mouthful may be eaten, on the second, two; thus he daily
increases his meal by one mouthful up to the full-moon day. On the
full-moon day, he makes an offering to Agni and to other deities... and
then gives a cow to a Brāhmaṇa. This is the *Ant-shaped Cāndrāyaṇa*. If
it is performed in the reverse order it is the *Barley-shaped
Cāndrāyaṇa*. A sinner who has performed either of these becomes free
from all mortal sins.’

*Viṣṇu* (47.1-6).—‘Now follows the *Cāndrāyāṇa*:—Let a man eat single
mouthfuls of food, unchanged in size; and let him, during the moon's
increase, add successively one mouthful every day; and during the wane
of the moon, let him take off one mouthful every day; and on the
moonless day, let him fast entirely. This is the *Barley-shaped
Cāndrāyaṇa*. The *Cāndrayaṇa* is called *Ant-shaped* when the moonless
day is placed in the middle, add it is called *Barley-shaped* when the
full moon day is placed in the middle.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.323).—‘When one is performing the *Cāndrāyaṇa*, during
the bright half of the month, one should increase daily, by one, the
number of food-morsels, each of which is of the size of the peacock’s
egg; and during the dark half, he shall reduce it daily by one.’

217	If one diminishes (one's food daily by) one mouthful during the dark (half of the month) and increases (it in the same manner) during the bright half, and bathes (daily) at the time of three libations (morning, noon, and evening), that is called a lunar penance (Kandrayana).
