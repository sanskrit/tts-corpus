‘*Those whose sins ham become known*’—to the people.

‘*These penances*’—the several kinds of *Kṛcchra*. Those who have
committed secret sins are not to perform the *Kṛcchra* penances; they
should he purified^(‘)*by means of sacred texts and Homa-offerings*.’

“Who is to do this purification? If the Assembly, then in the case of
secret sins the offender does not go to the Assembly; for if he did go,
he would no longer be one^(‘)whose sin is not known’; and further, only
persons knowing the facts of the case are entitled to sit in the
Assembly.”

The answer to this is as follows:—The teacher does not mean to specify
who is to do the purification; his sole purpose is to teach the pupils
that such and such acts should be regarded as expiatory of secret
sins.—(226)

*Kṛcchra* and the rest;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 502).

reciting sacred texts, in giving gifts, in offering oblations with fire
and repeating *mantras*, will undoubtedly, become freed from the guilt
of crimes.’
