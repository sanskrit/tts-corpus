<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 168);—in *Smṛtitattva* II (p.
87);—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 684), which explains
‘*sāmparāyikam*’ as future effect, in the shape of accession to Heaven
and so forth;—in *Hemādri* (Dāna p. 88), which explains ‘*sāmparāyikam*’
as ‘pertaining to the other world’ *i.e*., supernatural;—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumdī* (p. 288);—in *Dānamayūkha* (p. 8);—in
*Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 8);—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 14);—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 306);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 29 and
71), to the effect that the secondary course is effective only when the
primary one is impossible,—it explains ‘*prabhuḥ*’ as ‘capable’ and
‘*sāmparāyikam*’ as ‘pertaining to the other world’;—in
*Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 352);—in *Hemādri* (śrāddha, p. 452);—and in
*Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 9 and 196), which explains the meaning to be that
‘so long as one, is able to adopt the primary course, he is not entitled
to the adopting of the secondary one’.
