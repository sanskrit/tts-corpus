Those that grow in a plot of land that has been cultivated with the
plough, the spade and other implements, and those that grow by
themselves in the forest;—if one cuts these ‘*needlessly*’—*i.e*., not
for any such purpose as the feeding of cattle and the like,—he should
‘*attend on the cow* *for* *one day*’—with great joy.

‘*Subsisting on milk*.’—This precludes all other food.—(144)

*Viṣṇu* (50.50).—‘If a man has wantonly cut such plants as grow by
cultivation, or such as rise spontaneously in the woods,—he must wait on
a cow and subsist on milk for one day.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.276).—(See under 142.)
