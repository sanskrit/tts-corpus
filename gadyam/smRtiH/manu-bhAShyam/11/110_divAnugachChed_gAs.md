<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When he is living in a cow-pen, he shall follow the cows that live in
that pen, when they go out to graze. The use of the pronoun ‘*those*’
implies that he should follow those cows in whose pen he is living;
specially as, if he were to go after other cows, this would not mean
constant ‘following.’

And while going along he shall inhale the dust raised by the cows.

Having wandered about with the cows, during the day, he should return to
the pen with them.

Having ‘*attended to them*’—served them by rubbing their bodies and
removed the dust from them; and ‘*having bowed to them*’—kneeling, and
with his head down;—‘*he shall rest in the Vīrāsana posture*.’ When one
rests, neither on a raised platform nor on a bedstead, but simply by
sitting down, it is called the ‘*Vīrāsana*’ *posture*.—(110)
