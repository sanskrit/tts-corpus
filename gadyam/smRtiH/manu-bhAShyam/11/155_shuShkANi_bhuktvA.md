If one eats dried meat, mushrooms growing on the ground, or unrecognised meat lying in the slaughter-house—he shall perform this same penance.—(155)

‘*Dried meat*’— such for instance, as dried pork and so forth.

‘*Growing m the ground*.’—This epithet has been added with a view to
show that those growing in cavities are not forbidden.

‘*Unrecognised*’—it being unascertainable whether it is flesh of sheep
or of buffalo.

‘*Slaughter-house*’—where animals are killed for sale. In the case of
meat found in other places, the expiation is a light one.

“In fact when the text emphasises the qualification of ‘*lying in the
slaughter-house*,’ there should be no harm in meat obtained elsewhere.”

It is not so; since all meat connected with the ‘slaughterhouse’ has
been forbidden in general terms. Though as regards expiation, a
comparative reduction or enhancement would always he proper, in view of
the exact place from where the meat has been obtained.

‘*This same*’—*i.e*., the *Cāndrāyaṇa*.

When, however, the exact species of the animal is known, the repeated
eating of such meat, would involve the drinking of barley-gruel for
seven days. In the rest, ‘one should fast during the day.’—(155)

‘*Ajñātam*’.—‘Unknown’ (Medhātithi);—‘unintentionally’ (Govindarāja and
Rāghavānanda); ‘*Bhaumāni kavakāni*’.—To be taken together according to
Medhātithi; separately, according to Rāghavānanda, who takes
‘*bhaumāni*’ as ‘mushrooms growing on the ground,’ and ‘*Kavakānī*’ as
‘mushrooms growing on trees’.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1166), which adds that the
expiation here prescribed is for the eating of mushrooms growing on the
ground, not those growing on trees;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 285).

*Viṣṇu* (51.27, 34).—‘The *Cāndrāyaṇa* penance should be performed for
eating unknown flesh, meat kept in a slaughterhouse and dried meat. For
eating the *Chatrāka* or the *Kavaka*, one must perform the *Sāntapana*
penance.’
