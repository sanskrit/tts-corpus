The time for the Brāhmaṇa’s Initiation has been laid down as extending
up to the sixteenth year of his age; and the present text lays down the
expiation for transgressing this limit.

If to a Brāhmaṇa the *Sāvitrī* has not been taught—from the seventh to
the sixteenth year of his age—the ‘*teaching of the Sāvitrī*’ stands
here for the sacrament of *Initiation*; hence the meaning is ‘if the
Initiation has not been performed at the said time’; similarly up to the
twenty-second year for the Kṣatriya, and the twenty-fourth year for the
Vaiśya,—then after the lapse of this time, he should be made to perform
three ‘*Kṛcchra*’ penances. Where the term ‘Kṛcchra’ stands without an
epithet, it means the *Prājāpatya* penance,—such is the well-known usage
of *Smṛti*.

Others explain the ‘*Kṛcchra*’ here as standing for the
*Kṛcchātikṛcchra*.

After these *Kṛcchra* penances have been performed, he should be
initiated.

‘*In due form*’— This is purely reiterative.—(191)

[See
2.38.]

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 433), as
laying down the expiation for the ‘*Vrātya*’;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
871), which adds that—(*a*) in the case of the omission being due to the
absence of an initiator, the expiation should he that prescribed by Manu
and Yājñavalkya, and (*b*) in the case of omission being due to no such
unavoidable circumstances, nor in times of digress, it should be ‘Three
Years’ Penance’ prescribed under the section on cow-slaughter.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1107), which explains ‘*trīn kṛcchrān*’
as meaning—(1) The *Prājāpatya*, (2) the *Kṛcchra* and (3) the
*Atikṛcchra*;—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), as laying down what should be done
when one has become a ‘*vrātya*’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
350);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 384.)

*Viṣṇu* (54-26).—‘Those twice-born men by whom the *Gāyatrī* has not
been repeated, nor the other ceremonies performed, as the law directs,
must be made to perform three *Prājāpatya* penances and then initiated
according to custom.’

*Āpastamba* (1.1.28-29).—‘If the proper time for initiation has passed,
he shall observe, for the space of two months, the duties of a Student,
as observed by those who are studying the three Vedas; after that he may
be initiated; and after that he may be instructed.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.76-78).—‘A man who has missed the *Sāvitrī* may undergo
the *Uddālaka* penance. Let him subsist, during two months, on
barley-gruel, during one month on milk, during half a month on curds,
during eight days on clarified butter, during six days on alms given
without asking, and during three days on water; and let him fast for one
day and night. Or, he may go to bathe with the priests at the end of an
*Āśvamedha* sacrifice. Or, he may perform the *Vrātya-stoma*.’
