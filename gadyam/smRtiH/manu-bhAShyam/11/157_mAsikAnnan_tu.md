‘*Monthly rite*’—*i.e*., the ‘*Ekoddiṣṭa*’ *śrāddha*, which is performed
every month, for one year, till the performance of the
‘*Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa*.’ Though the *śrāddha* performed on the new-moon day is
also called a ‘monthly śrāddha,’ eating at it has been permitted by such
texts as—‘when invited he may freely eat’; how then could there be any
expiation needed in this case?

Others have held that what is permitted is eating *on invitation*, so
that if one eats *without invitation* at the new-moon śrāddhas also, he
should be liable to the said expiation.

‘*Who has not completed his course of study*’—*i.e*., while one is still
residing with the teacher; *i.e*., the Religious Student.

Out of the three days, on any ono day, he may remain in water. Since the
‘three days’ are mentioned, there would be no justification for adding a
fourth day.—(157)

‘*Ekāhañcodāke vaset*’.—This is to be done, on the fourth day
(Medhātithi),—on any one of the three fasting days (Govindarāja and
Kullūka),—on the first day (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1144), which explains ‘*Māsika*’
as standing for the *Śrāddha* that is done every month during the first
year on the date of death, and *not* for the *Amāvāsyā śrāddha*;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 307), which says that this refers to the act
being *unintentional*, and adds that ‘*māsikānnam*’ refers to food given
at all after-death *śrāddhas*,—and that what is meant by ‘*ekāhamudake
vaset*’ is that ‘he should fast for three days and live on water on the
fourth day.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (23.12).—‘The *Kṛcchra* penance must he performed if the
Student eats food even at a Śrāddha, or by a person who is impure on
account of a recent birth or death.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.43-44).—‘A Student who partakes of a Śrāddha repast must
fast for three days; and he must remain in water for a whole day
afterwards.’
