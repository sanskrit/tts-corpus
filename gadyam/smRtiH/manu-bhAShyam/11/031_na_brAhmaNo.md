What the verse means is that when the occasion for it arises there is
nothing wrong in the Brāhmaṇa having recourse to malevolent rites; it
does not actually enjoin these rites; nor does it actually forbid the
act of complaining to the King; all that is meant is that if there has
been occasion for it, and the Brāhmaṇa does have recourse to the
malevolent rites, the King shall not interfere with him. This is what is
going to be declared later on: ‘The Brāhmaṇa is the creator, the
punisher, etc, etc.—hence no one should say anything unpleasant to him’
(Verse 35),—where it is understood that the King shall not tell him
anything.

‘*Shall punish* ’— Though there is this injunction, yet, as a rule, the
Brāhmaṇa should complain to the King; because the sentence ‘*he* *shall
not complain to the* *King*’ is not a prohibition, as is clear from the
consideration of the concluding verse.

The occasions referred to here have been already enumerated—‘If one
molests his wife’ and so forth. In the case of slight offences, he shall
complain to the King—‘this man has done this to me.’

‘*Conversant with the Law*’—*i.e*., knowing the procedure of the
malevolent rites.

‘*By* *his own power*’—by means of incantations and curses; that these
are meant being clearly indicated by the next verse.—(31)

031	A Brahmana who knows the law need not bring any (offence) to the notice of the king; by his own power alone be can punish those men who injure him.
