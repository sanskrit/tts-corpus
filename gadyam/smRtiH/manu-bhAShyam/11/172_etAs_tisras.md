A wise man should never take these three as his wife; being blood-relations, they are not fit to be married; because by marrying them one sinks low.—(172)

“The unmarriageability of these being already implied by the law that no
‘sapiṇḍa’ relation shall be wedded, for what special purpose does the
present text assert that *they are not fit to be married*?”

Some people offer the following explanation:—It is asserted here with a
view to permit the option of marrying such relations other than these
three as have been precluded on the ground of Sapiṇḍa-relationship.

This, however, is not right Because the present text is meant to lay
down the expiation necessary in the case of these three, which is
different from that in the case of other Sapiṇḍa relations; and so long
as this explanation of the text is possible, it would be highly improper
to reject, even partially, the injunctions of the text forbidding the
marrying of all ‘Sapiṇḍa relations’; options are admitted only when they
cannot be avoided.

‘*Jñāti*’—blood-relation.

‘*Not fit to be married*’— not fit to be wedded, or for intercourse.

‘*Marrying*’— wedding.

‘*Sinks low*’— that is, he falls into hell; or it may mean that he
becomes degraded in caste, comes to belong to a lower caste. Though in
reality, a man’s caste cannot leave him so long as his body lasts, yet
what is meant is that he ceases to be entitled to the performance of his
caste-functions.—(172)

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.37-38).—‘If he unintentionally marries a female
belonging to the same *Gotra* as himself he shall support her, treating

the fire.’

173	A wise man should not take as his wife any of these three; they must not be wedded because they are (Sapinda-) relatives, he who marries (one of them), sinks low.
