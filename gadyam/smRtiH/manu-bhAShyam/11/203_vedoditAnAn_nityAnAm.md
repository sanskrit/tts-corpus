The duties laid down in the Veda are—(a) the *Śrauta* sacrifices,
*Darśapūrṇamāsa* and the rest and (b) the *Smārta* rites of the Twilight
Prayers and the rest. These latter also are regarded as ‘laid down in
the Veda,’ because *Smṛtis* have their source in the Veda.

‘*The observances of the Accomplished Student*’—*e.g*., ‘He shall not
wear over-worn or dirty clothes’ and so forth.

If these are omitted, the offender should fast for one day.

In connection with the omission of the *Śrauta* rites, some sacrifices
have been prescribed by way of expiation; and with these the ‘fasting’
here prescribed is to be combined.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 809):—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (pp.
84 and 345);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 579);—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 957), to the effect that in the ease of the omission of those
*Śrauta* and *Smāṛta* rites for which, no specific expiation is
prescribed, the *fasting* here laid down series as the expiation; and
where a specific expiation has been prescribed, it has to be done *along
with* this fasting;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1188), which explains
‘*abhojanam*’ as *fasting*, and adds the same note as the above;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 443), which adds that this fasting has
to he done along with the rites specifically prescribed;—in *Mitākṣarā*
(3.242);—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 286 and 368), which says that this
refers to a single omission,—and explains ‘*Snātaka*’ as
‘house-holder’;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 357), which says that
this refers to cases of *unintentional* omission.
