‘*Without water*’— when water is not at hand, or not visible.

‘*Pressed*’—overfull with excreta.

‘*Bodily refuse*’—urine or ordure.

On ‘*passing*’ these, one should bathe ‘*in his clothes*’—the clothes in
which he committed the act.

‘*Outside*’—the village.

‘*Bathing*’—becoming immersed in water; and ‘touching’ a cow,—he becomes
pure.—(202)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.293), which adds the following
notes—‘*Vinā adbhiḥ*’, when there is no water near at hand,—‘*śārīram*,’
the passing of urine and stools;—it adds that this refers to cases where
the act has been done *unintentionally*.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1187), which explains ‘*Śārīram*’ as the
passing of urine and stools;—and in the *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 456),
which explains ‘*Śārīram*’ as ‘the passing of urine or stools,’ and says
that it refers to cases where the man omits the use of water on account
of dire urgency.

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 1187).—‘When a Brāhmaṇa is travelling in places
where there is no water, if he happen to become unclean, he should
plunge into water with clothes on, as soon as he finds it; or he may
repeat the *Gāyatrī* a hundred times, which is the highest kind of
*Bath*.’
