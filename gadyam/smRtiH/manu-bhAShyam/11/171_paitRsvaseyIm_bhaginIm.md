This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 714);—in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 198);—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 691);—and in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 470), which has the following notes:—‘The
term ‘*bhaginī*’ qualifies ‘*paitṛṣvaseyī*’ and the rest,—‘*āptasya*’
qualifies ‘the mother’s brother’, after which ‘daughter’ is to be
understood; ‘*āptasya*’ means ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’; the ‘mother’ is one who has
been married by the ‘*gāndharva*’ and other forms of marriage;—in the
term ‘*paitṛṣvaseyī*’ also the ‘*pitṛṣvasā*’, ‘father’s sister’ meant is
one who is still within the limits of ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ relationship, and who
had been married by the *Gāndharva* form;—it is only when the term is
taken in this sense that the qualification ‘*bhaginī*’ has some
significance.

It is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra 52a);—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 187), which explains ‘*āptasya*’ (which is its reading for
‘*tanayām*’) as ‘a near *sapiṇḍa*’.
