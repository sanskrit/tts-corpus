<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This expiation refers to the drinking of water out of a vessel in which
the taste of wine is felt.

“The term ‘*madya*,’ ‘intoxicating drink,’ being a general one, all that
is intended would be secured from the single word ‘*contained in a pot
used far keeping intoxicating drinks*’; and the other word ‘*contained
in a vessel used for keeping nine*’ should not have been used.”

True; this would be so if there were not a great difference between the
expiations prescribed for the drinking of ‘wine’ and of ‘intoxicating
drinks.’ When, however, there *is* such a difference, it would appear
that, there should be a correspondingly heavier expiation for the
drinking of water contained in a *wine-vessel*;—and it is with a view to
preclude this idea that the text prescribes the same expiation for both.

‘*For five days he shall drink milk in which Śaṅkha-puṣpī has been
boiled*.’ The term ‘*payas*’ here stands for *milk*; because the
particular term ‘*śhṛta*’ (in the sense of *boiled*) is used only in
connection with *milk* and sacrificial materials.

‘*Śaṅkhapuṣpī*’ is the name of a medicinal herb; and this shall be
pounded and boiled in milk, which shall be drunk for five days.—(147)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1074), which explains that
‘*payaḥ*’ here stands for *milk*;—again on p. 1160, where it is added
that this refers to cases where the water has been drunk and vomitted by
women or children, and it was contained in a vessel that had contained
wine, hut was not wet with it, so that the water had not imbibed either
the taste or the smell of the liquor.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 349), which adds that
this refers to cases of unintentional repeated drinking of the
water;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 324), which says that ‘*payaḥ*’
means *milk*; ‘*Śaṅkhapuṣpī*’ is a particular herb.

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.22).—‘He who drinks water which has stood in a vessel
used for keeping *Surā*, shall live six days on milk in which leaves of
the *Śaṅkhapuṣpī* plant has been boiled.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20-21).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa drinks water which has stood in a
vessel used for keeping wine, he becomes pure by drinking, during three
days, water mixed with a decoction of lotus, Udumbara, Bilva, and Palāsa
leaves.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.23-24).—‘After having drunk water from a vessel in which
liquor had been kept, he must drink for seven days milk boiled with the
*Śaṅkhapuṣpī* plant. After having drunk water from a vessel in which any
intoxicating beverage had been kept, he must drink the said milk for
five days.’
