**क्रव्यादास्** तरक्षुसिंहमृगादयः । **अक्रव्यादाः** रुरुपृषतादयः । **धेनुर्** गौर् एव । **कृष्णलं** विशिष्टपरिमाणं सुवर्णम् । दण्डाधिकारशास्त्रपरिभाषा, अन्यत्र लौकिकम् एव- "शतकृष्णलं घृतम् आयुष्कामः" इति ॥ ११.१३७ ॥

‘*Carnivorous animals*’—*e.g*., the hyena, the lion and so forth.

‘*Not carnivorous*’—*e.g*., the several species of the deer.

‘*Dhenu*’—stands for the *cow* only.

‘*Kṛṣṇala*’— is a gold-piece of a definite weight. The term has this
technical meaning in treatises on Fines; but

elsewhere it is used in the ordinary sense of a particular
weight-measure; as in such passages as—‘one desiring longevity should
give one hundred *kṛṣṇalas* of clarified butter.’—(137)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1132);—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.272);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 950);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 232 and 527),
which says that this refers to *unintentional* killing, and that once
only.
