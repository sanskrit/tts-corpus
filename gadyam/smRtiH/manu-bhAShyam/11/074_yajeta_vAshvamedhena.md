जनपदेश्वरस्य्**आश्वमेधे** ऽधिकारः । तत्र हिरणादिप्राच्यादिगम्यः आहृतं द्रव्यं दक्षिणा विहिता । ये चानाहिताग्नयस् ते न यागेष्व् अधिक्रियन्ते । न पुनस् तदर्थम् एवाधानं कर्तव्यम् । कर्माणि हि प्रयश्चित्तार्थानि साङ्गानि । न चाङ्गम् आधानम् ॥ ११.७४ ॥

It is only the lord of a kingdom that is entitled to the performance of
a Horse-sacrifice; as the sacrificial fee prescribed in that connection
is such gold and other metals as have been won from the Eastern and
other quarters.

Those persons who have not performed the Fire-laying rite are not
entitled to the performance of any sacrifice. Nor would they he
justified in laying the Fires for the purpose of these sacrifices only;
because the rites for the purposes of expiation are to be done only
along with their own accessory details, and ‘Fire-laying’ does not form
the accessory of any of these sacrifices.—(74)

‘*Svarjitā*.’—‘*Svarjit*’ is the name of a sacrifice, according to
Nārāyaṇa and Kullūka;—according to others the term is only an epithet of
‘*gosavena*.’

‘*Trivṛtā*’.—Qualifies the ‘Agniṣṭut’, according to Medhātithi;—but
stands for a distinct sacrifice, the *Trivṛtstoma*, according to
Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa.

For the *Gosava* see Kātyāyana-śrautasūtra 22.11.3 for the *Ābhijit*,
Āśvalāyana-śrautasūtra 8.5.13;—for the *Agniṣṭut*, Ibid 9.7.22—25.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.248);—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 405).
