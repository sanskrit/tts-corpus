<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse sets forth certain optional details regarding the
‘Twelve-year Penance,’—the ‘shaving’ being the only additional factor
laid down.

The man living under a tree in the hermitage,—this being an alternative
to the ‘hut’ (prescribed in 73).

“How is it that this alternative was not mentioned along with the other
one (in 73)?”

The older writers have explained that this has not been done, because
the author desired it to be understood that all that follows after the
present verse pertains to the ‘Twelve-year Penance,’ and it does not
constitute a distinct penance. If in the course of the treatment of one
subject, an entirely new subject is introduced, it becomes something
wholly different; and the introducing of a wholly different subject
before the one already taken up has been finished, would be highly
objectionable. If the rite thus interpolated were an independent one,
the only thing one could do would be to adopt in practice only one of
the two.—(78)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse lays down an option regarding observances during the twelve
years of penance (verse 72)—according to Medhātithi, Govindarāja and
Kullūka;—according to Nārāyaṇa it provides a general rule for all
penances.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.243), which cays that this is an
option to what has been said in verse 72;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 788),
which also adds that this lays down an option;—and in *parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, pp. 399-400), which notes that the ‘*vā*’ of the
‘*Kṛtavāpanaḥ*’ indicates that ‘shaving’ is an option to the wearing of
matted locks.
