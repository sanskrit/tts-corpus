प्रत्यहं मासम् **अष्टौ** ग्रासान् कृष्णपक्षाद् वारभ्य शुक्लपक्षाद् वा **यतिचान्द्रायणं** भवति । **मध्यंदिने स्थिते** प्रवृत्ते । पूर्वाह्णापराह्णौ वर्जयित्वेत्य् अर्थः । शिष्टं प्रसिद्धम् ॥ ११.२१८ ॥

Everyday he shall eat eight morsels,—beginning either with the dark or
with the bright half of the month.

This is the ‘*Yati-Cāndrāyaṇa*.’

‘*At midday*’—when midday has approached; that is, avoiding the forenoon
and the afternoon.

The rest is clear.—(218)

**(verses 11.218-219)  
**

These verses are quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1243);—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.325),
which add that in the *Yaticāndrā-yaṇa* and other penances, it is not
necessary to follow the movements of the moon; so that there would be no
harm if the beginning were made on even the fifth day of the *lunar*
month, if that happened to be the first day of the *solar* month;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 517).

*Baudhāyana* (4.5.19).—‘If, self-restrained, he daily eats, during a
month, at mid-day, eight mouthfuls of sacrificial food, he performs the
*Yati-Cāndrāyaṇa*.’

*Viṣṇu* (47.7).—‘If a man eats for a month eight mouthfuls a day, it is
the penance called *Yati-Cāndrāyaṇa*.’
