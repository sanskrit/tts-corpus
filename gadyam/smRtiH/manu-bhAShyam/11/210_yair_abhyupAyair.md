“The methods have been already described: ‘In such and such case it
shall be the Cāndrāyaṇa,’ ‘in that the Prājāpatya,’ and ‘in that other
the Twelve-year-long Penance,’ and so forth.”

True; but they have been only named; it is now that they are going to
have their forms and procedure described.

‘*Abhyupāya*’ is the same as ‘*upāya*,’ ‘*method*.’

‘Wipes off’—washes off.

‘*By gods*, *etc*.’—This is purely commendatory.

‘*Man*.’—This term is used in order to show that what is spoken of
pertains to all castes.—(210)
