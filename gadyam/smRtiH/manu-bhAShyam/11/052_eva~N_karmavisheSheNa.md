The stealer of gold has disfigured nails; the drinker of wine, black teeth; the slayer of a Brāhmaṇa, consumption; and the violator of his preceptor’s bed, a disfigured skin;—(49) the informer, a foul-smelling nose; the false caluminator, a foul-smelling mouth; the stealer of grains, a deficiency of limbs; and the adulterator, an excess of limbs;—(50) the stealer of food, dyspepsia; the stealer of words, dumbness; the stealer of clothes, leucoderma; and the stealer of horse, lameness.—(51) It is thus that idiots, the dumb, the blind, the deaf and deformed men, despised by righteous men, are born, on account of particular acts.—(52)

**(verses 11.49-52)**

By killing a Brāhmaṇa one becomes affected by *consumption*—a very
serious disease known among physicians by that name.

One who has intercourse with his preceptor’s wife suffers from
‘disfigured skin.’

The ‘*informer*’ has a nose emitting nauseous smell; and ‘*the false
caluminator has a foul-smelling mouth*.’

“The *caluminator* also is only an *informer*.”

True; but one of them (the former) assumes other people’s defects, while
the other describes only those that really exist;—that is the sole
difference between the two.

‘*Excess of limbs*’—more than the natural number.

‘*Adulterator*’—one who mixes commodities with inferior ones resembling
it, *e.g*., saffron with the *Kusumbha* flower.

‘*Dyspeptic*’—one who cannot digest the food eaten.

^(‘)*Dumbness*’—Incapability of speech; *e.g*., the idiot, the epileptic
and the like.

The rest is well known.

^(‘)*Deformed*.’—Their figure is despicable.

All this is the result of ‘*particular acts*.’ These acts bring about
the said effects instead of making the men sink into hell and suffer
after-death tortures; or even for those who, even though they have
passed through all these latter, have still some remnant left of the
force of their past misdeeds; or for those in whose case the force of
their meritorious deeds being greater, the effects of the evil deeds
have had no occasion to assert themselves. In all such cases there is a
‘residue’ of past acts.—(49-52)

**(verse 11.51)**

‘*Vāgapahārakaḥ*.’—‘Stealer of speech’,—*i.e*., one who learns the Veda
by stealth’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘a plagiarist’
(Nārāyaṇa).

\[*The additional verse, relating to the ‘stealer of a lamp’ has been
translated by Buhler as part of the text; it has been so accepted by
Rāghavānanda and Rāmacandra, but not by the other commentators. We have
followed the text of Medhātithi here; hence from this verse onward our
verse-numbering will be one less than that in Buhler*\], This additional
verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (p. 248).

053	Thus in consequence of a remnant of (the guilt of former) crimes, are born idiots, dumb, blind, deaf, and deformed men, who are (all) despised by the virtuous.
