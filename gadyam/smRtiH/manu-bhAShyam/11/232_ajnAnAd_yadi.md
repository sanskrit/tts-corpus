Either intentionally or unintentionally, if one has done a reprehensible act, he must not do it a second time, if he seeks absolution from the former.—(232)

कृतप्रायश्चित्तस्यापि पुनर् अकार्यप्रवृत्ताव् अधिकतरं प्रायश्चित्तम् इति एवमर्थं **द्वितीयं न समाचरेद्** इति । अथ वा निवृत्तेर् अनन्तरोपदिष्टाया अर्थवादो **द्वितीयं न समाचरितव्यम्** इति । व्रतं न हात्व्यम् ।

- तस्माद् आद्यकृताद् व्यतिक्रमाद् **विमुक्तिम् इच्छन्** मोक्षम् इच्छन् पुनर् न कुर्यात् । ततश् चैतद् उक्तं भवति । कृते ऽपि प्रायश्चित्ते न विमुच्यते, यदि पुनः समाचरति । न च निष्कृतौ कृतायाम् अकृतायाम् अपि मोक्षो युक्तो ऽतो मुक्तस्य मुक्तिम् अन्विच्चन्न् इति नोपपद्यते । तस्माद् आधिक्याय पुनर् वचनम् ॥ ११.२३२ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

If after having performed the expiation for a certain misdeed, one
commits the same act again, he becomes liable to a heavier expiation. It
is in view of this that it is said that ‘*he must not do it a second
time*.’

Or the words ‘*he must not do it a second time*’ may be taken as a
declamatory assertion commendatory of the ‘renunciation of misdeeds’
enjoined before (in 130);—the sense being that ‘he shall not abandon his
vow.’

Hence if one seeks absolution from the sin involved in the first
transgression, he should not repeat the act. Thus what is meant is that
merely by performing the expiation, one does not become freed from a
sin, if he commits the same act again.

But it does not stand to reason that, the man is not. absolved from sin,
both when he performs the expiation and when he does not perform it.
Hence the assertion in the present, verse must be taken simply as
indicating that there is heavy expiation in the case of committing the
deed over again.—(232)
