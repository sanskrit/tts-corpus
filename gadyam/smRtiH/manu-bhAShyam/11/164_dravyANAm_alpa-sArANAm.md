**अल्पसाराणि** न चिरम् अवतिष्ठन्ते, स्वल्पमूल्यानि च मृन्मयानि स्थालीपिठरादीनि दारुमयानि द्रोणाढकादीनि अयोमयानि लेपनीकुद्दालकादीनि । **वेश्मनीति** गृहस्थितापहारे भूयान् दोषः । न तथा खलक्षेत्रादिगते । **निर्यात्य** दत्वा । सर्वशेषश् चायं विशेषाभावात् । यत्र त्व् अपहृतं दातुम् अशक्यं तत्र द्विगुणं प्रायश्चित्तम् ॥ ११.१६४ ॥

‘*Things of small value*’ do not last long; and things of small value
are such earthenware articles as a dish, a cup, and so forth, as also
such wooden things as the ‘*droṇa*,’ the ‘*āḍhaka*’ and other weights;
and such iron things as the spade, the shovel, and so forth.

‘*In the house of another*.’—The stealing of things lying in the house
is a serious offence; not so that of things lying in the field or in the
courtyard.

‘*Restored*’—given back. This pertains to all cases of theft, as it has
not been qualified in any way.

In a case where it is not possible to restore what has been stolen, the
expiation shall be the double of what is prescribed here.—(164)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), as referring to the
stealing of such things of small value as tin, lead and the like,—which
thus becomes excluded from the expiation prescribed for ‘theft’ in
general;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 874), as referring to the stealing
of lead, tin and other things worth less than 25 *Paṇas*.
