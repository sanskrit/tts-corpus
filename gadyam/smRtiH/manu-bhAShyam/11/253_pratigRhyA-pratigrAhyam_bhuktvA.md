‘*What should not be accepted*’—such as wine and similar things, or gold
and such things from a sinner,—this latter also being ‘*what should not
be accepted*.’

‘*Reprehensible food*’—food that has been polluted by any one of the
four causes—its very nature, lapse of time, ownership and contact.

‘*Taratsamandīya verses*’—are four of the ‘*Pāvamanī*’ verses (Ṛgveda,
9.58.1-4).—(258)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 174);—in
*Mitākṣarā* (3.307), which explains ‘*apratigrāhyam*’ as ‘poison,
weapons, liquors, and things belonging to outcasts’;—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 994);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 415).

*Gautama* (24.2-3).—‘He who desires to accept, or has accepted a gift
which ought not to he accepted, shall recite the four Ṛk verses
beginning with “*Tarat sa mandī*,” standing in water. He who desires to
eat forbidden food, shall scatter earth on it.’

*Baudhāyana* (4.2.4-5).—‘He who is about to accept gifts, or he who has
accepted gifts, must repeatedly recite the four Ṛk-verses called
*Taratsamandīs*. But in case one has eaten any kind of forbidden food,
or food given by a person whose food should not be eaten, the means of
removing the guilt is to sprinkle water over one’s head while reciting
the *Taratsamandī* verses.’
