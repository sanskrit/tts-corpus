‘*Atone*’—expiate.

This verse shows that gifts constitute the principal atonement for sins.

‘*For each act*.’—This shows that what is here laid down is not to be
regarded as cumulative.

The words beginning with ‘*dvijaḥ*’ (‘twice-born person’) are added for
the purpose of filling up the metre.

In the absence of any specification, the term ‘*Kṛcchra*’ has been taken
to stand for the ‘*Prājāpatya*’ penance.—(139)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 30 and 50) which
explains the meaning to be that, if the offender is not in a position to
give the male cow or other things prescribed, be becomes absolved from
the sin by performing the *Kṛcchra* penance.’
