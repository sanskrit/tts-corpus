‘*Ākhu*’—rat.

‘*Defiled*’—rendered impure by the contact of the said things.

‘*Brahmasuvarcalā*’—Having pounded it and mixed it with water, he shall
drink it *for one day*; since the text does not make any specific
recommendation as to time, if the drinking is done once one day, the
injunction will have been duly obeyed.—(159)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 932), to the effect that on
eating the *ucchiṣṭa* of the cat and other animals one should drink the
*Brāhmīsuvarcalā* for one day;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 320), which
explains ‘*Brāhmasuvarcalā*’ as the yellow sun-flower,—the offender
should pass one day living on this;—and adds that this refers to cases
where the act is *unintentional*; where it is done intentionally, the
penance should he kept for *three* days;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p.
316).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (23.11).—(See above, 158.)

*Viṣṇu* (51.46-47).—‘If any one eats the leavings of the food of a cat,
of a crow, of an ichneumon, or of a rat, he must drink water in which
*Brahma-śūvarcalā* has been boiled. For eating what has been left by a
dog, he must fast for one day and then drink the five bovine products.’
