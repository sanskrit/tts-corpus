As a man, having committed a misdeed, goes on proclaiming it himself, so does he become freed from that sin, as a snake from its slough.—(228)

ख्यापनविधेर् अर्थवादः । **नरो ऽधर्मम्** इति नञः प्रश्लेषः । धर्मस्य स्वयं ख्यापनं निषिद्धम्- "न गुणाः स्वयं वाच्याः" इति । प्रकृतश् चाधर्म एव **तेनाधर्मेणेति** श्रूयत एव ॥ ११.२२८ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is a declamatory passage in support of the injunction of
Confession.

In the expression ‘*naro-dharmam*,’ an ‘a’ is to be understood between
the two words. As the proclaiming of one’s own righteous deeds has been
forbidden—‘one should not proclaim his own good qualities’; while it is
‘*adharma*,’ ‘*sin*,’ that forms the subject-matter of the context; and
the text itself in the second half has the term ‘*adharmeṇa*.’— (228)

229	In proportion as a man who has done wrong, himself confesses it, even so far he is freed from guilt, as a snake from its slough.
