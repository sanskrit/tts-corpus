मनुष्यलोके यत् सुखम् आभिमानीकं जनपदैश्वर्यादि, यच् चैहिकम् अरोगित्वादि, यच् च साम्सर्गिकं धनपुत्रादि संपत्, यथाभिमतकान्तादिविषयोपभोगलक्षणम् ऐन्द्रियकम्, यच् च वेदेषु "मनुष्याणां शतम् आनन्दाः स एक आजानदेवेषु" (बाउ ४.३.३३) इत्यादि, तस्य **सर्वस्य तपोमूलं** उत्पत्तिकारणम् । **तपोमध्यम्** उत्पन्नस्य स्थितिर् मध्यावस्था । **अन्तो** ऽवसानम् । तदपेक्षयेति वेदविदां दर्शनम् । यथैव कर्मणि स्वर्गग्रामाद्यभिप्रेतफलसाधनान्य् एवं तपो विज्ञेयम् ॥ ११.२३४ ॥

In the world of men whatever ‘*happiness*’—in the form of glory of
lordship over men and countries and so forth—or *physical*, in the form
of good health and the like,—or *social*, such as that obtained from
wealth, children and so forth—or the *sensual*, in the form of pleasures
derived from the wife and others;—and also that of the gods,—what has
been described in the Veda, in such passages as ‘hundred pleasures of
men constitute one pleasure of the gods’;—of all this austerity is the
‘*source*,’—the cause of its origin.

Austerity is its ‘*middle*’— The continued existence of a thing is
called its ‘*middle*.’

Similarly Austerity is its ‘*end*..’

The view of persons learned in the Veda is that Austerity brings about
the same desirable results, in the form of Heaven and other desirable
things, as those brought about by the sacrificial and other acts.—(234)
