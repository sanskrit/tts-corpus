‘*Excommunicated from repasts*’—as described in Discourse III; in
connection with each one of whom, distinct expiations have been
prescribed elsewhere.

For these there should be, *for one month*—(a) the reciting of the Vedic
text, (b) the ‘Sākala Homa’ and (c) eating at the sixth meal-time;—all
three combined.

The ‘*Sākala Homa*’ is that which is offered with wooden sticks (?) and
with the *mantra* ‘*Devakṛtasya*, etc., etc.’ (*Vāja-saneya-Saṃhitā*, 8.
13).

‘*Daily*.’—This has been added in older to show that even after the
reciting of the Vedic text has been finished, this offering shall be
continued, till the end of the month.—(200)

See above 3.151 *et. seq*. for ‘*Apāṅktyas*’; and
*Śuklayajurveda-saṃhitā* (8.13) for the *Śākala-homas*.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1158), which notes that the
‘*Apāṅktyas’'* have been described by Manu himself under the section on
‘*śrāddhas*’;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (3.286), and again under 3.289, where
it is added that the particular expiation to be performed is to be
determined by considerations of the caste of the offender and such other
circumstances.
