Though the term ‘*dakṣiṇā*’ primarily denotes the fee that is given to a
man for doing some work, yet, here it stands for all those things that
are given away, with the exception of cows, lands and golden vessels.
Such too is the ordinary use of the term.

‘*For others*’—for supplicants other than those mentioned here.

‘*Cooked food*’—To such men cooked food shall be given for eating.

‘*Outside the sacrificial enclosure*’—his refers to the food that should
be given by householders, apart from that which is given in connection
with sacrificial performances.—(3)

According to Kullūka, the meaning is that ‘to these most excellent
Brāhmaṇas food together with presents must be given inside the
sacrificial enclosure’;—according to *Nārāyaṇa*, ‘the nine mendicants
mentioned in verses 1 and 2 shall always receive what they ask for, and
other mendicants ordinary food only, but that if they beg at the
performance of a sacrifice, other property also must be given to them’.
