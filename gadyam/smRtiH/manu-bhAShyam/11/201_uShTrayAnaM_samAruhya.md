If a Brāhmaṇa intentionally hides a conveyance drawn by a camel, or one drawn by asses,—or if he bathes naked,—he becomes pure by ‘breath-suppression.’—(201)

**उष्ट्रैर्** युक्तं **यानं** गन्त्र्यादि । साक्षाद् उष्ट्रादाव् आरोहणम् अव्यवधानेन चाधिकतरम्, प्राणायामानाम् आवृत्तिः । **दिग्वासा** नग्नः । नग्नदोषनिर्हरणार्थं पुनः सवासाः स्नानं कृत्वा प्राणायामः कर्तव्यः ॥ ११.२०१ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Uṣṭra-yāna*’ is a cart to which a camel is yoked.

Riding on the camel itself would involve a heavier expiation,—in the
shape of the repetition of ‘Breath-control.’

‘*Digvāsā*’—naked.

For the atonement of the offence of being naked, the man should bathe
along with his clothes, and then perform the ‘Breath-suppression.’—(201)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1184), which adds that in the
case of the offence being *unintentional*, the expiation is to consist
of *bathing only*;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 462).

*Yājñavalkya* (3.291).—‘The man who rides in a cart drawn by an ass or a
camel should perform breath-suspension in water.’

*Viṣṇu* (54.23).—‘One who has been riding upon a camel, or upon an ass,
and one who has bathed, or slept, or eaten, quite naked, must suspend
his breath thrice.’
