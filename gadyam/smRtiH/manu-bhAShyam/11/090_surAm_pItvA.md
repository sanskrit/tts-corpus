Though the text speaks of ‘*twice-born men*,’ yet what is said here is
meant for the Brāhmaṇa only; says another Smṛti text—‘Hot wine should be
poured on the Brāhmaṇa’ (*Gautama*, 23.1).

‘*Through folly*’—this is only explanatory.

‘*Red hot*’— Though the text uses the word ‘*varṇa*’ *colour*, yet it is
mere *heat* that is meant; as is clear from what follows, about ‘*the
body being burnt*.’—(90)

The liquor Here meant is that distilled from ground grains, according to
Medhātithi, Govindarāja And Kullūka;—according to Nārāyaṇa the
death-penance is meant for all twice-born men partaking of liquor
distilled from grains, and by Brāhmaṇas who have drunk any of the three
kinds of liquor described under verse 95.

‘*Mohāt*’.—Nandana reads ‘*amohāt*’ and explains it as ‘not
unintentionally’, ‘intentionally.’

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.253), which explains ‘*mohāt*’ as
meaning ‘ignorance of scriptural injunctions’.—It enters into a long
discussion regarding the exact connotation in the present context, of
the term ‘*surā*,’ and comes to the conclusion that it stands for the
liquor distilled from ground grains; the partaking of which is equally
heinous for all the three higher castes,—the drinking of the other two
kinds, that distilled from molasses and that from honey, being sinful
for the Brāhmaṇa only.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 815), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Mohāt*’ stands for ‘ignorance of the scriptures,’ and not for
‘ignorance of the nature of the liquid drunk’;—‘*agnivarṇām*,’ ‘heated
to the extent of becoming red-hot’;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta
9a);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 93), which explains ‘*agnivarṇām*’
as ‘hot as fire,’ and quotes Jikana to the effect that ‘*mohāt*’ means
‘intentionally.’

**(verses 11.90-93)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (12.165.48).

*Gautama* (23.1).—‘They shall pour hot wine into the mouth of a Brāhmaṇa
who has drunk wine; he will be purified by death.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.18, 19, 21).—‘If he has drunk *Surā* he shall scald
himself to death with hot wine. For unintentionally drinking *Surā*, he
shall perform the *Kṛcchra* penances during three months and then
undergo a second initiation. They quote the following—“A Brāhmaṇa, a
Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya who has unintentionally drunk the wine called
*Vāruṇī* must be initiated a second time.”’

*Āpastamba* (1.25.3).—‘A wine-drinker has to drink exceedingly hot
liquor, so that he dies.’

*Vaśiṣtha* (20-19, 22).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa intentionally drinks liquor other
than *Surā*, or if he unintentionally drinks *Surā*, he must perform a
*Kṛcchra* and an *Atikṛcchra*; and after eating clarified butter, be
initiated again. But a Brāhmaṇa who repeatedly partakes of *Surā* shall
drink liquor of the same kind boiling hot. He becomes pure by death.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.253-256).—‘The man who drinks *Surā* attains purity by
dying after drinking any one of the following things red-hot—*Surā*,
water, clarified butter, cow’s urine and milk. Or he may perform the
penance prescribed for Brāhmaṇa-killing, clothed in hair-cloth and
wearing matted looks; or for one year he may use sesamum oil-cake or
grains of rice at night only. If any one of the three castes unknowingly
drinks the *Vāruṇī* wine, ho shall undergo initiation a second time. The
Brāhmaṇa woman who drinks wine does not go to her husband’s regions; and
in the world she is born as a bitch.’

*Viṣṇu* (51-1).—‘A drinker of wine must abstain from all religious rites
and subsist on grains unseparated from the husk for one year.’
