This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), which adds that, inasmuch
as the expiation is twelve times as heavy as that prescribed in 165, the
articles mentioned should he understood to be twelve times the value of
the single meal in *Madanapārijata* (p. 875), which makes the same
remark;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 74a);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 341), which explains ‘*Kaṇānnatā*’ as ‘living on
small pieces of grain’.

for twelve days.’
