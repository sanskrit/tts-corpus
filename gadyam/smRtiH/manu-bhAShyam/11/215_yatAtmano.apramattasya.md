**यतात्मा** संयतेन्द्रियो गीतादिशब्दश्रवणेष्व् अनभिलाषी । **अप्रमत्तस्** तत्परः । अर्थवादो ऽयम्, सर्वकृच्छ्रेष्व् अस्य धर्मस्य विहितत्वात् ॥ ११.२१५ ॥

‘*Self-controlled*’—with the senses under control, not longing for music
and such amusements.

‘*Guarded*’— ever bent upon the penance.

This is purely commendatory, being common to all forms of ‘*Kṛcchra*’
(and not restricted to the *Parāka only*).—(215)
