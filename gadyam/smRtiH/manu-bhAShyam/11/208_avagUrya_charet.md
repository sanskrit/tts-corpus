This propounds the expiation for the offences described above.

The ‘shedding of blood’ spoken of here is something different from
‘causing pain to a Brāhmaṇa’ mentioned above (under 67); or the two may
be regarded as optional alternatives.—(208)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 479);—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.280),
which remarks that when bleeding is brought about, it must involve both
‘threatening’ (*avagūraṇa*) and ‘striking’ (*nipātana*),—as without
these there could be no *wounding* but in the case of bleeding, the
expiation would be ‘*Kṛcchrātikṛcchra*’ (which is prescribed for the
bleeding), and not ‘*Kṛcchra*’ and ‘*Atikṛcchra*’ also (which are
prescribed separately for ‘threatening’ and ‘striking’
respectively);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 464).

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.7).—‘He who has raised his hand against a Brāhmaṇa
shall perform a *Kṛcchra* penance; an *Atikṛcchra* penance, if he
strikes him; *Kṛcchra* and *Cāndrāyaṇa*, if blood flows.’

*Viṣṇu* (54.30).—‘For attacking a Brāhmaṇa, the *Kṛcchra* penance should
be performed; for striking him, the *Atikṛcchra*; and for fetching blood
from him, the *Kṛcchrātikṛcchra*.’

*Parāśara* (11.51).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.293).—‘For raising a stick against a Brāhmaṇa, the
*Kṛcchra* penance; for striking him, the *Atikṛcchra*; for fetching his
blood, the *Kṛcchrātikṛcchra*; for inflicting such hurt as keeps the
blood within the skin, the *Kṛcchra* should be performed.’
