‘*Deposit*’—even such as consists of not very valuable things.

‘*Men*.’—This term stands for the *kind*; hence the stealing of women
also stands on the same footing. This same sin accrues to him who, after
having betrothed his daughter to one man, gives her ultimately to
another, even when no defects have been found in the former bridegroom.
This is what has been described as the man ‘falling upon a lie.’—(57)
