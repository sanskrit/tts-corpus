‘*The Sāvitrī three thousand times*’— Some people take this to mean that
this should be done everyday; while others construe ‘*trīṇi*’ with
‘*māsam*’ \[the meaning being, that the whole is to run for *three
months*\]; so that the *mantra* would have to be repeated one hundred
times everyday.

‘*Cow-pen*’—the place where cows are kept.—(194)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 430), as
referring to cases where both the *giver* and the *gift* are unfit, and
improper;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1150), to the effect that ‘residence in the
cow-pen’ is an essential factor in the expiation;—in *Mitākṣarā*
(3.290), which adds the following notes:—The repetition of the *Sāvitrī*
here prescribed is to be done daily, as is clear from the Accusative
ending in ‘*māsam*’ which denotes *duration*;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 403).
