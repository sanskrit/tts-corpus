The righteous king shall inflict no punishment upon him; as it is only through the foolishness of the Kṣatriya that the Brāhmaṇa suffers from hunger.—(21)

अस्मिन् निमित्ते चौरत्वेनानीतेभ्यो राज्ञा दण्डो न कर्तव्यः । यतस् तस्यैव **बालिश्यान्** मौर्ख्यात् **क्षुधावसीदन्ति** । **क्षुधे**त्य् अविवक्षितम्, उभयोः प्रकरणाद् अर्थवादत्वाच् च ॥ ११.२१ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

If a person is brought before the king charged with theft, under the
circumstances above described, he shall not be punished; as it is only
on account of the king’s ‘*foolishness*’—folly—‘*that the Brāhmaṇa
suffers from hunger*.’

Stress is not meant to be laid on ‘hunger’ only; as both ‘hunger’ and
‘sacrificial needs’ are meant, as is clear from the context and from the
implications of the declamatory passages.—(21)

क्षुल् लिङ्गं चैतद् उभयत्रापि समानप्रकरणत्वाद् विज्ञेयम् ॥ ११.२० ॥

021	On him (who, for the reasons stated, appropriates another's possessions), a righteous king shall not inflict punishment; for (in that case) a Brahmana pines with hunger through the Kshatriya's want of care.
