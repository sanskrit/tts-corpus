‘*Pure soured liquids*’—such as have been permitted, as ‘among soured
liquids, curds are eatable, etc.’ (5.10). As regards *curds*, however,
the present text has nothing to do with it; for even though it is a
‘soured liquid,’ its eatability has been distinctly asserted; in fact
the texts declare that it is a *purifying* substance.

‘*Decoctions*’—are well-known in medical works, as prepared by the
boiling of herbs.

‘Impure’—defiled.

‘Until *it has gone down*’— ‘Going down’ stands for their being digested
and passed out in the form of urine and excreta; or it may mean simply
reaching the digestive organ.—(153)
