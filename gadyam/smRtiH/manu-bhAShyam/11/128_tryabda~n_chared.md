<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The first half of the verse explains what is meant by the ‘one-fourth’
mentioned in the preceding verse.

‘*Wearing matted* *locks*.’— Some people hold that this is meant to
exclude the wearing of rags, carrying of a part of the bedstead and so
forth (which have been prescribed for the Brāhmaṇa-killer).

This, however, is not right. For what the present verse does is to apply
to the case in question the ‘one fourth’ part of only those details that
have been prescribed for the Brāhmaṇa-killer, and not of anything else,
even though some such be possible;—walking against the current, of the
Sarasvatī and such other (optional) details (laid down in 78 *et.
seq*.,) being adopted only when there is some necessity for them.

‘*Far off*’— All that this means is that he should not remain in the
village.

‘*Under the root of a tree*’;—*i.e*.., having built a hut there.—(128)

According to Medhātithi and Rāghavānanda this verse only reiterates what
has been prescribed in verse 126, all the details of which are meant to
be observed in the present connection;—but according to Govindarāja and
Kullūka, the special details, of carrying the skull and so forth, which
are not expressly mentioned here, are not meant here.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 128);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 216 and 534).
