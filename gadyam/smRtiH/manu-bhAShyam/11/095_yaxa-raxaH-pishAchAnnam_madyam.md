‘*Yakṣa*’ and the rest are lower classes of beings, ignorant of the law
relating to what should and what should not be eaten; and it is they
that eat meat

The compound ‘*Surāsavam*,’ is a copulative one, *i.e*., in accordance
with Pāṇini 2.4.6.

‘*Distilled liquor*’ also is a kind of ‘*intoxicant*,’ there being a
slight difference between the two. The two are mentioned on the analogy
of such expressions as ‘the ox and the bull’

‘*Who partake of the offering to the gods*’—The cake, rice and such
substance offered to the gods are called ‘*offerings*’; as mentioned in
connection with the *Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* and other sacrifices. It is these
that it is right and proper for the Brāhmaṇa to eat, and not wine and
meat, which are the food of the lower spirits.—(95)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.253), as implying that it is for
the Brāhmaṇa alone that all the three kinds of liquor are equally
forbidden;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1069), to the effect that (*a*) the *Surā*
is to be avoided by all the twice-born, even before initiation, (*b*)
the *Mādhvī* and the *Gauḍī* are to be avoided by the Brāhmaṇa at all
times, but by the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya only during the period of
studentship.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 225);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika
548);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 814), to the effect that the *Mādhvī* and
the *Gauḍī* are forbidden only for the Brāhmaṇa, not for the Kṣatriya
and the Vaiśya; but they are forbidden for all the three higher castes
during the period of studentship;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 355).
