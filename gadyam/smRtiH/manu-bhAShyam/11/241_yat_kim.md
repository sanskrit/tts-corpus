वाङ्मनःकायकृतस्य जपहोमाभ्यां शुद्धिः स्मर्यते । तत्र **तपसा** निवृत्तिः स्यात् । अत इदम् आरभ्यते तद् अपि तपसानूद्यते ॥ ११.२४१ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It has been declared in the *Smṛtis* that sins committed by thought,
word and deed are wiped off by the repeating of sacred texts and the
offering of *Homa*; from which it might be assumed that these are beyond
the scope of Austerities. It is in view of such an assumption that the
text proceeds to add this verse;—the sense being that the said sins also
are wiped off by Austerities.—(241)
