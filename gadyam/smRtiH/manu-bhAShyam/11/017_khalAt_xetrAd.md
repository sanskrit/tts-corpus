Likewise one who has not eaten six meals, may, for the seventh meal, take from a person whose sacred duties are neglected,—but only to this extent that it does not last till the morrow;—(16) either from the threshing yard, or from the field, or from the house, or from any place where it may be got; but if the owner questions him, he must confess it to the questioner.—(17)

**(verses 11.16-17)**

The property of another person may he seized also when one’s own family
is suffering from want

‘*Not lasting till the morrow*.’—The addition of this phrase implies
that the taking of only that much is permitted which may maintain the
family for one day,—and no more.

‘*From one whose sacred duties are neglected*’—implies that it may be
taken for the purpose of sacred rites.

Another *Smṛti* says—‘At first one should appropriate from a person of
lower status than himself; if no such be available, then from a man of
equal status; and in the event of this also being not available, even
from a person of superior righteousness.’

‘*For the seventh meal*.’—If the man has not eaten for three days he may
appropriate another’s property for his morning meal on the fourth day.
Two meals a day have been laid down in such texts as—‘one shall eat in
the morning and in the evening.’

‘*Or from any place*.’—Even out of the garden and such places.

‘*He should confess it*’—but ‘*to the questioner*’ *only*;—‘*if he
questions him*,’—*i.e*., he should not send for him and force the owner
to question him.

Or the ‘*questioner*’ may stand for the owner of the property, and ‘*if
he questions him*’ for the king; the king questioning him when he is
taken before him (and charged with having taken away the property). In
this manner we may distinguish between the two terms ‘*pṛcchate*’ and
‘*pṛcchati*.’ Says Gautama (18. 30)—‘Questioned by the king he should
confess it’

What is said here should be understood to apply to both cases—*want of
food*, and shortage of sacrificial requisites.—(16-17)

**(verse 11.16)**

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2. 275), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following notes:—‘*Bhakta*’ is food; ‘*saptame bhakte*,’ on the
fourth day;—‘*aśvastanavidhānena*,’ in such a way that there may be
nothing left over for the second day;—‘*hīnakarmaṇaḥ*,’ from a man whose
religious acts are very poor.—It is quoted again under (2.43), whíere
the meaning is explained as that ‘if, in the absence of food, a man has
gone without food for three days, he should wrest from a man deficient
in religious acts just enough for one day.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 938), which explains the meaning as—‘if a
man has gone without food for six meals, then at the time of his seventh
meal, he should take by force just enough for the day from a man of
lower caste and also from one who is deficient in religious acts.’

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 352), to the effect that if a man
has gone without six meals, he may steal food; and notes that this
sanction implies that one may even perform the Vaiśvadeva rites with
such stolen food.

**(verse 11.17)**

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.43), to the effect that if, under
circumstances mentioned in the preceding verse, one has stolen food, he
should confess if asked;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 938), to the effect that
the food spoken of in the preceding verse, may be taken from the
threshing-yard and other places.
