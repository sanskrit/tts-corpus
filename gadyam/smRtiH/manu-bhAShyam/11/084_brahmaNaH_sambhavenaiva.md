It behoves the man liable to expiation to present himself before the
Congregation or Court, and he should act in accordance with that law
which may be honoured by that assembly; the present verse and the next
serve to indicate the high qualifications of the assembly.

‘*By his very birth the Brāhmaṇa is a divinity even for the gods*’—*and*
‘*for the people he is an authority*’—trustworthy guide,—people reposing
as much trust on his words as upon what they see with their own eyes.

‘*The Veda itself is the cause of this*.’—The Brāhmaṇa is regarded as an
authority on spiritual matters, only because he knows the Veda and what
is contained in it—(84)

085	By his origin alone a Brahmana is a deity even for the gods, and (his teaching is) authoritative for men, because the Veda is the foundation for that.
