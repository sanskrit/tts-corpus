<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The present verse describes what sort of water-offering is to be made
for one who has performed the prescribed penance.

‘*They shall bathe with him in a reservoir of water*,’—in a sacred
river, or in a large lake, or in some such sacred place as Prabhāsa,
Mānasa and the like;—‘*and throw a fresh jar full of water*.’

Since the present text speaks of the ‘fresh jar’ and the foregoing one
speaks of the ‘female slave,’ it means that in the former case, the jar
to be used should be one that has been already in use for other
purposes. In both cases the jar is to be filled with water.—(186)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.296), to the effect that the
aforesaid offering should be made after the offenders have taken a bath
in a sacred tank;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (pp. 402 and 409);—in *Smṛtitattva*
(p. 472);—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 966), which explains ‘*prāsyeyuḥ*’
as ‘should throw’.

**(verses 11.186-187)**

*Gautama* (20.10-14).—‘But if an outcast has been purified by penances,
his kinsmen shall fill a golden vessel with water from a very holy lake
or river, and make him bathe in that water. Then they shall give him
that vessel, and he, after taking it, shall recite the following
text—“Cleansed is the sky, etc.” Let him offer clarified butter reciting
the sacred texts. Let him then present gold or a cow to a Brāhmaṇa, and
also to his teacher.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.36).—(See above, under 182.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.295).—‘When he returns after having performed the
requisite penances, they shall pour a fresh jarful of water; after that
they shall not despise him, and they shall associate with him in all
matters.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (15.17-20).—‘Outcasts who have performed the prescribed
penance may be re-admitted. Those who strike their teacher, mother or
father may be re-admitted in the following manner: Having filled a
golden or an earthen vessel with water from a sacred lake or river, they
pour it over him reciting three sacred texts.’
