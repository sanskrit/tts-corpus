**गोमूत्रा**दीनां कुशोदकानां समाहारम् आहुर् एकस्मिन्न् अहन्य् । **एकरात्रोपवासश् च** । ततो द्व्यहं **सान्तपनम्** । 

- <u>अन्ये</u> तु प्रत्यहम् एकैकं भक्षयितव्यम्, संहतस्याश्रुतत्वात् । अतः सप्ताहानि सान्तपनम् । 

- द्वाव् अप्य् एतौ पक्षौ स्मृत्यन्तरे परिगृहीतौ ॥ ११.२१२ ॥

They say that on one day there should be a combination of *cow’s urine*
and other tilings down to ‘*Kuśa-water*’; and this is to be followed by
*fastingy for one ḍay*. Thus the ‘*Sāntapana*’ lasts for two days.

Others hold that each of the things named has to be eaten on one day,—as
no combination is found mentioned anywhere;—and according to this view,
the ‘*Sāntapana*’ would last for *seven days*. Both these views have
been held by another *Smṛti text*.—(212)

*Baudhāyana* (4.5.11).—‘If one lives one day on cow’s urine, one day on
cow-dung, one day on milk, one day on sour milk, one day on clarified
butter, one day on a decoction of *Kuśa* grass, and during one day and
night, on air; that is called the *Sāntapana Kṛcchra*.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (27.13).—‘Subsisting during one day on each of the following
substances—cow’s urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, butter, and decoction
of *Kuśa-* grass,—and fasting on the seventh day—purifies even him who
fears that he has partaken of the food of a *Caṇḍāla*.’

*Parāśara* (10.29).—(Same as Manu.)

*Viṣṇu* (46, 19).—‘Subsisting one day on cow’s urine and cowdung, milk,
sour milk, butter and water in which *Kuśa* grass has been boiled, and
fasting the next day, is called *Sāntapana*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.315).—‘Kuśa-water, cow’s milk, sour milk, urine,
cowdung, and butter,—having eaten these, if one fasts on the following
day, it is *Sāntapana Kṛcchra*.’
