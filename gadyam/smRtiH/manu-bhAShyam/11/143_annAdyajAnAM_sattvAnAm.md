<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The creatures or living beings that are bred in cooked rice, and other
kinds of food kept for a long time.

‘*Bred in sauces*’—such as molasses, gruel and so forth.

The insects inside figs and such others are those ‘*bred in fruits and
flowers*.’

‘*Eating with clarified butter*’—that is, when one begins to take his
food, he should drink clarified butter;—the particle ‘*pra*’ in
‘*prāśa*’ denoting *beginning*. Hence what is laid down does not exclude
owlinary food, as is done in the case of the ‘*Payovrata*’ (subsisting
on milk) and other penances; and the reason for this lies in the
consideration that the creatures concerned are so insignificant that
mere ‘breath-control’ has been prescribed as the expiation for killing
them; so that the expiation in question (if it meant subsisting on
clarified butter *only*) would be too heavy for such a trifling offence.
Hence what is meant by ‘eating with clarified butter’ is that just a
little of it should he sipped in the beginning.—(143)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1138), which adds that ‘*ghāte*,’
‘on cutting,’ is to be construed with

this verse;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 242), which explains
‘*anādya*’ as *śaktu* and the rest,—‘*rasa*’ as ‘molasses and the
like,’—‘*phala*’ as ‘the jujube and so forth,’—‘*puṣpa*’ as the
*Madhūka* and the rest,—if one kills the insects produced in these
things *unintentionally*, one should eat clarified butter and then fast
for a day.

*Viṣṇu* (50.49).—‘For killing insects bred in rice or other food, or in
sweets and such things, or in liquids, or elsewhere, or in flowers or
fruits,—the penance consists in eating clarified butter.’
