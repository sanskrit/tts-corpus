स्वल्पशरीरत्वम् इह्**आस्थिमत्त्वम्**, अनस्थिसाहचर्यात् । **अनः** शकटस् तत्संख्यानम् एतत् । ॥ ११.१४० ॥

_उक्तार्थे सत्य् एव_[^२१०] ।


[^२१०]:
     All editors place this at the end of the commentary on the previous verse. But, it appears to be an introduction to the next verse, which prescribes additional or different penances for the same offences. Jha's translation appears to support this.

‘*With bones*.’—This denotes the smallness of the body; as is clear from
its being mentioned along with ‘*boneless* animals.’

‘*Anas*’ is cart, which stands here as a measure.

Though this expiation has been laid down here, yet, something else also
has got to be done, as laid down in the next versa—(140)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaś chitta, p. 66);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 241), which explains the meaning to be that for
the *unintentional* killing of 1,000 insects with bones, or a cartful of
boneless insects, one should perform the ‘six-montly penance’, which
Manu has prescribed in connection with the killing of a Śūdra; if it is
done *intentionally*, then the ‘one year penance’ is to be performed.

**(verses 11.140-141)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (50.46-47).—‘If he has killed a thousand small animals having
hones,—or an ox-load of boneless animals,—he must perform the same
penance as for killing a Śūdra. But if he has killed animals having
bones, he must also give some trifle to a Brāhmaṇa; if he has killed
boneless animals, he becomes purified by one breath-suspension.’

*Gautama* (22.20-2).—‘For killing one thousand small animals with bones,
also for killing an ox-load of boneless animals, the same penance as for
killing a cow; or he may also give something for the killing of each
animal with bones.’

*Āpastamba* (1.26.2).—‘For killing an ox-load of boneless animals, the
same penance as for killing a Śūdra.

*Vaśiṣṭha* (21-25).—‘Having slain a quantity of boneless animals, equal
to the weight of a cow, one should perform the *Kṛcchra* penance of
twelve days’ duration, and also give something.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.269, 275).—‘For killing a thousand animals with bones,
or a cart-load of boneless animals, one should perform the same penance

something; and for killing a boneless animal, he shall perform
breath-suspension.’
