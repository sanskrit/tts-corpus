He shall give away everything that he may be possessed of, in the shape
of gold, cattle and the like.

The author adds a declamatory qualification—‘wealth sufficient *for*
*his* *maintenance*’:—That is the giving of the property would be equal
to making a gift to him of his life.

‘Or, *a house along with the furniture*.’—‘*Furniture*’ includes all
such household accessories as butter, oil, grains, pots and pans,
metals, beds, seats and so forth.—(76)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.250);—in *Aparārka* (p. 1061),
which adds the following notes:—One who is unable to provide property
enough for his lifelong maintenance, should give a house with furniture,
and if unable to give this latter, he should give away all that he
possesses;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 802), which also adds the same
note;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 399), which adds that the
rule is that one who is sonless shall give away his entire property,
while one who has a son shall give only a house with furniture;—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 6a.)
