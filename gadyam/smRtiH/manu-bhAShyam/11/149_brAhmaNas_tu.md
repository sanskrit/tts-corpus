**सुरापस्य गन्धम्** इति सुराया एव जाठरेणागिना धातुभिश् च संयोगेन गन्धघ्राणे लघीयः । भाण्डान्तरस्थितायाः प्राप्तिर् अघ्रायैव ।

‘*Odour given out by a wine-drinker*.’—The odour that conies out of the
mouth of a person who has drunk wine, is due to its digestion undergone
in the stomach and contact with other substances therein contained;
hence the offence is a comparatively light one. The odour of wine kept
in a vessel, can be easily avoided (hence the inhaling of its odour
would be a serious offence).

Others explain the text to mean that this same expiation applies to a
case where the said odour is inhaled by a Brāhmaṇa who is habituated to
drinking wine.

‘*Who has partaken of Soma*’— This specification implies that what is
said here does not apply to the case of one who has performed the
*Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* sacrifices.

‘*Eating clarified butter*.’—Here also, the eating of other things is
not precluded.

Since ‘*wine*’ has been mentioned by name, what is said here does not
apply to the case of other *intoxicating drinks*.—(149)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.255), which remarks that this
refers to the case of a Soma-sacrificer *unintentionally* smelling the
liquor; if it is intentional, the expiation is to be doubled;—in the
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 822), which also remarks that this refers to
unintentional smelling; intentional smelling involving double the said
expiation;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1164);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta,
p. 349), as referring to the case of the smelling of the mouth of the
man who has drunk wine;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 9b).

*Mahābhārata* (12.165.76).—(Same as Manu.)

*Gautama* (23-6).—‘If he inhales the fume exhaled by a man who has drunk
wine, he shall thrice suspend his breath and eat clarified butter.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.25).—‘A Soma-sacrificer who has smelt the breath of a man
who had been drinking wine, must plunge into water, recite the
*Aghamarṣaṇa-mantra* three times and eat clarified butter afterwards.’
