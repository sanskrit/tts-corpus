यावती दक्षिणा विहिता ततो न्यूना दीयते यत्र सो **ऽल्पदक्षिणो** **यज्ञः**[^३४] । 


[^३४]:

- "परिक्रयः किल दक्षिणा । स्वल्पेन चेत् परिक्रयेण कर्मकरो लभ्यते, किम् इति बहु दीयते, लोक इव वाहादीनाम् । 

- पणलभ्यं हि कः प्राज्ञः क्रीणाति दशभिः पणैः ।

द्वादशशतदानं तत्फलभूयस्त्वाय" — इति मन्यमानस्य प्रतिषेधः । ये तु स्वल्पदक्षिणा उत्पत्त्यैव च सोमे दक्षिणेति क्रतुमन्तो न तन् निषिध्यते ॥ ११.३९ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

A sacrifice is regarded as ‘*with small fees*’ when the fee given at it
is smaller than what has been prescribed.

“The fee is a sort of *hire*; if a worker is obtained at a lower hire,
why should anything higher be paid? This is the principle that governs
all dealings of people in the ordinary world, with the ploughman and
other workers. There is the saying also—‘when a thing can be had for one
*paṇa*, what wise men shall buy it for ten paṇas?’ If the sacred texts
prescribe ‘twelve-hundred’ as the fee, this is done only with a view to
the obtaining of higher rewards.”

It is people entertaining such notions for whose sake the present text
sets forth the prohibition, and it does not refer to a case where the
prescribed fee itself is *small*.—(39)
