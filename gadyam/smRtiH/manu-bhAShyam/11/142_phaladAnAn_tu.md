‘*Fruit-bearing trees*’—such as the Mango, the Kaṇṭakī and the like.

The *reciting of one hundred* *Ṛk* *verses* is meant for twice-born men.

“What then is to be the expiation for a Śūdra?”

Some people hold that for them the expiation shall be the same as for
the ‘*minor offence*’ of ‘cutting green trees for fuel.’ This, however,
cannot be right, as that would be too heavy.

“If that is too heavy, why should it have been prescribed in connection
with *minor offences*?”

The expiation laid down there was for repeated acts.

For these reasons, for the Śūdra cutting fruit-bearing trees, etc., the
expiation shall be fasting for two or three days.

‘*Shrubs*,’ *etc*.—have been already explained.

‘*Latā*’—stands here for branches of trees.—(142)

‘*Ṛkṣatam* (*Ṛcśatam*?).’—‘One hundred verses, the *Gāyatrī* and the
like’ (Kullūka);—‘the *Gāyatrī* itself repeated a hundred times’
(Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.276);—in *Parā* *sha* *ramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 434), which notes that this refers to the cutting of
trees etc., other than that for sacrificial purposes;—in *Aparārka* (p.
1134), which notes that ‘*puṣpitānām*’ goes with ‘*vīrudhām*’;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 920), which notes that there is nothing wrong in
cutting the trees etc., for the purposes of the five great sacrifices
and other religious purpose;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 243), which
says that this refers to the cutting of trees with very few fruits.
