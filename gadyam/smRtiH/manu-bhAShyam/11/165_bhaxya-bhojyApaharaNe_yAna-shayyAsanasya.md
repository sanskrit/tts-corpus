‘*Conveyance*’—the cart and such things.

‘*Bed*’—the bedstead, and so forth.

‘*Seat*’—the mat, the stool, or wooden slab.

‘*Eatables and edibles*.’—The distinction between the two should be
understood to be this that while one stands for what is dry and
scattered, the other stands for the reverse;—‘*eatables\`*’ standing for
such things as sweetmeats, cakes and the like and ‘*edibles*’ for
barley-gruel and such things.

‘*Five Products of the Cow*’—These are well-known.

Here also what is mentioned should be eaten for one day only.—(165)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), as referring to cases where
the quantity of food stolen is just enough for one meal;—and in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 875), which has the same note, and adds that, in as
much as the ‘conveyance’ and other things have been mentioned in the
same context, these also should he understood to be of just that value
which would be equivalent to the value of a single meal.
