**एतद् एवेति** गोघातकप्रायश्चित्तं सर्वेषूपपातकेष्व् अतिदिशति । वैकल्पिकं **चान्द्रायणम् अपि** । उपपातकित्वे विशेषोपदेशान् न गोघ्नस्य चान्द्रायणम् इच्छन्ति । तेषाम् **उपपातकित्व**वचने गोघ्नस्य प्रयोजनं मृग्यम् ॥ ११.१७७ ॥

‘*This same*’:—this means that the expiatory rites laid down for
*cow-killing* are applicable to all ‘minor offences.’ And the
‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ is another optional alternative.

Inasmuch as this latter rule has been laid down with special reference
to the *other* ‘*minor offences*’ some people hold that the
‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ does not apply to the case of the cow-killer.

But according to this view, it will be necessary to find out why the
*cow-killer* has been mentioned at all among ‘those who have committed
*minor offences*.’—(117)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), as referring to cases of
intentionally committed offences, and as standing for the ‘Three *Years*
Penance’;—in *Aparārkā* (p. 1105), which also notes that this stands for
the ‘Three Years Penance’;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 425) as
referring to the ‘Three Years Penance’;—in *Prāyaścīttaviveka* (p. 394
and 463);—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 362), which says that ‘*etat*’
stands for the ‘Three monthly Penance’ prescribed for cow-killing.

*Yājñavalkya* (3.263).—‘From the *Upapātakas* (minor sins), one becomes
absolved either in the aforesaid manner, or by the *Cāndrāyaṇa*, or by
the *Parāka*, or by living upon milk for a month.’
