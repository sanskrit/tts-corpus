‘*As in the case of the dead*’— This is an injunction of what should be
done (in the case of the dead).

The female slave shall overturn with her foot the water-jar,
saying—‘This is for so and so’ (naming the outcast).

After this has been done, it is necessary to observe ‘un-cleanliness’
during the day and night.

‘*Along with the relations*’— They shall all sit in one place, for that
day.

The naming of the ‘*female slave*’ indicates that the *Sapiṇḍas* should
not do it themselves.

“If that be so, and the Sapiṇḍas do not do this act themselves, what
should be the difference between ‘*Sapiṇḍas*’ and ‘*relations*,’ in view
of which it has been said that all this should be done in the presence
of relations, priests and elders? Since all (*Sapiṇḍas* as well as
*Relations*) would be helping the offering only by their *presence*, and
thus acting like an indirect accessory.”

It is not so; ‘*Sapiṇḍas*’ and others of that class are the ‘performers’
of the act of offering in the sense that it is they that *direct* it;
while ‘Relations,’ ‘priests’ and the rest are brought together only with
a view to some spiritual effect.—(183)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 964), which explains
‘*pretarat*’ as wearing the upper cloth over the right shoulder and so
forth;—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.295), to the effect that the slave-girl may
make the offerings under orders of the paternal relations of the
outcast—it explains ‘*pretavat*’ as implying that the offender should
face the south, wear the upper cloth over the right shoulder and so
forth;—and in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 408).
