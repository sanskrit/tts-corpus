In the case of acts conducive to the degradation of ‘caste-mixture,’ or of those that make one unworthy of receiving gifts, purification is secured by the monthly lunar penance; and in the case of those that lead to defilement, one should mortify his body on barley-products for three days.—(125)

संकरीकरणम् अपात्रीकरणं पूर्वम् उक्तेनेति । एवं **संकरापात्रकृत्यास्व्** इति संज्ञिभेदाद् बहुवचनम् । **कृत्या**शब्दः प्रत्येकम् अभिसंबध्यते । कृत्यं कारणम् । **ऐन्दवो** मासः चान्द्रायण्ः । **यावको** यवविकारः पेयलेह्यादिः । अत्राविशेषश्रवणे ऽपीच्छानिच्छयोर् गुरुलघुभावो विज्ञेयः ॥ ११.१२५ ॥

The acts ‘*conducive to the degradation of mixed caste*’ and ‘*those
that make one unworthy of receiving gifts*’ have been described above
(68 and 69); and the plural number is due to the large number of acts
included in these two sets.

The term ‘*Kṛtyā*,’ ‘*acts*’ is to be construed with each of the two
terms ‘*Saṅkara*’ and ‘*apātra*’ ‘*Kṛtyā* means *deed*.

‘*The monthly Lunar penance*’—is the ‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*.’
‘*Barley-products*’—articles of food prepared from barley,—fit for
drinking or sipping and so forth.

Though the expiation mentioned here is without any distinction, yet, a
distinction has always to be made in the lightness or heaviness of the
penance, according as the act is done *intentionally or
unintentionally*.—(125)

The ‘*Saṅkarīkaraṇa*’, ‘*apātrīkaraṇa*’ and ‘*malinīkaraṇa*’ offences
have been enumerated above, under verses 68, 69 and 70.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣaṛā* (3.290);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 403 and 431).
