In a previous verse ‘*one eighth*’ was prescribed for the killing of a
Vaiśya; what the present verse lays down is ‘one twelfth.’

As the expiation is a light one, it has to be done ‘*for one* *year*.’

It appears that the rule here laid down is meant for the case of a
Vaiśya devoid of qualifications.

“The case of a Vaiśya *devoted to his duty* has been already dealt with
before.”

True; but what the present verse contemplates is the case of a Vaiśya
who was ‘righteous’ at the time of death, but was devoid of qualities
before that; while the previous rules apply to one who was righteous all
along.—(129)

“According to Govindarāja and Kullūka, the two penances are to be
performed optionally, in case a virtuous Vaiśya has been killed
unintentionally.—Medhātithi says that the first penance is to be
performed for the murder of a Vaiśya who was less distinguished than the
one referred to in verse 126.—Nārāyaṇa thinks that the verse refers to a
Vaiśya engaged in the performance of a sacrifice, and that the particle
‘*vā*’ takes the place of the?upola, and thus one penance only is
prescribed.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 216 and 534), which
explains ‘*ekaśatam*’ as ‘a hundred and one’.
