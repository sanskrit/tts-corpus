^(‘)*Samutkarṣe*’—The Locative ending denotes *purpose*; just as in the
expression ‘*carmaṇi dvīpinam hanti*’ (‘kills the tiger for the sake of
his skin’). When a man lies with the motive of securing honour for
himself, his offence is equal to that of killing a Brāhmaṇa. For
instance, on an occasion great honour or much wealth is expected to be
obtained by every one who is a Brāhmaṇa, or a Vedic scholar, or belongs
to a high family,—if one falsely represents himself as such; or when a
person needs a qualified recipient for his gifts, if one, though not so
qualified, represents himself to be as such. In such cases the man lies
‘*for self-aggrandisement*’; this is what is meant, and not any small
gain for oneself; even though this latter also may be called
‘*samutkarṣe*.’

One is said to ‘caluminate’ people when he falsely attributes evils to
him.

‘*Falsely harassing the preceptor*’—causing him pain and anxiety by
falsely telling him such things as ‘your unmarried daughter is
pregnant,’ and so forth; which implies needless hatred. Or,
‘*nirbandha*’ may stand for quarrelling with him before the King, or
bringing a false (barge against him. Says Gautama,—‘False accusation of
the Teacher, etc...... are equal to the heinous offences.’ (21.10)—(55)

‘*Guroścālīkanirbandhaḥ*.’—‘Wrongfully going to law against the teacher’
(Medhātithi), or ‘falsely accusing the teacher’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja
and Kullūka);—‘Repeatedly doing what is disagreeable to the teacher’
(Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p, 419), as
enumerating offences on the same footing as Brāhmaṇa-slaughter;—in
*Aparārka* (p. 1047), which adds the following notes:—On the occasion of
the examination of the disputed superiority of qualifications of two
rivals, if the Judge pronounces a false judgment, this act is as sinful
as the killing of a Brāhmaṇa; ‘*alīkanirbandha*’ is false
accusation;—and in *Madanapārijātā* (p. 807), which adds the explanation
that ‘when a man without knowing the our Vedas, represents himself to
the king as knowing them,—and some one is asked to examine the validity
of the claim—if this latter should make a false report, the sin incurred
by him is equal to that involved in Brāhmaṇa-slaughter’.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 177), which adds the following
notes—‘*Anṛtañca samutkarṣe*’ means the misrepresentation of oneself as
possessing qualities which are not really possessed, *e.g*., when a
Śūdra says ‘I am a Brāhmaṇa’ and wears the sacred thread,—or
misrepresentation regarding the qualifications of another person *e.g*.,
if one were to say of a learned Brāhmaṇa that he knows nothing,—this is
equal to ‘Brāhmaṇa-murder’,—*i.e*. involves the twelve-year
penance;—this refers to cases of *intentional* and *repeated*
acts,—‘*paiśuna*’ is backbiting to the king, and ‘*guroḥ* &c.’ is false
accusation of one’s father.

**(verses 11.55-56)  
**

*Gautama* (21.10).—‘Giving false evidence, calumnies which will reach
the ears of the king, an untrue accusation against the *Guru*, are equal
to the *Mahāpātakas*.’

Do. (21.1).—See under 54.

*Viṣṇu* (36.1).—‘Killing a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya, engaged in a sacrifice,
or a woman in her courses, or a pregnant woman, or a Brāhmaṇa woman who
has bathed after temporary uncleanliness, or an embryo of an unknown
sex, or one come for protection, are crimes equal to the crime of
Brāhmaṇa-killing.’

Do. (36.2).—‘Giving false evidence, killing a friend, these are equal to
wine-drinking.’

Do. (37.1-5).—‘Setting one’s self up by false statements, making
statements which will reach the ears of the King, regarding a minor
offence committed by some one, unjustly upbraiding a *Guru*, reviling
the Veda, forgetting the studied Vedic texts; these are crimes of the
fourth degree.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.228-29).—‘Insulting one’s *Guru*, reviling the Veda,
killing a friend, forgetting what has been learnt, these are equal to
Brāhmaṇa-killing; eating forbidden food, dishonesty, lying for
aggrandisement, kissing a woman in the courses, are equal to
wine-drinking.’

*Āpastamba* (1.21.8).—See under 54.
