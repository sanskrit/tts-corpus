<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The first half of the verse is purely reiterative; as what the verse
lays down is the expiation for the unintentional eating of improper food

The meaning is that the food should be immediately vomited. Or ‘*it
should be atoned, for by means of purifications*’ —*i.e*., expiations.

Others explain ‘*purifications*’ as standing for the *Harītakī* and such
other purgatives; and they quote, in their support, the following from
Gautama (23.23)—‘For eating improper food, the bowels should be cleared
of all refuse.’

This passage, however, does not support the said interpretation; as even
fasting would *clear the bowels of all ref use*.

Hence the meaning must be that in the event of the man not vomiting the
food, he should perform the prescribed expiations.—(160)

‘*Śodhanaiḥ*.’—‘Penances’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘purgative decoctions’ (‘others’ in Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa
and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 548);—and in
*Prayaścittaviveka* (p. 342).
