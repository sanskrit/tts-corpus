<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The syllable ‘*hum*’ is uttered as a sign of anger and insult; *e.g*.,
in such expressions as—‘Keep quiet, hum! don’t speak like this’ and so
forth;—the syllable ‘*hum*’ being uttered by way of a prohibition.

‘*Against a Brāhmaṇa*,’—be he older, or equal or younger, a pupil or a
son.

Similarly—‘*if he addresses a superior person as* “*Thou*,”’—*e.g*.,
‘Thou sayest so,’ ‘thou didst this.’

The expiation here laid down is for the use of the singular form of the
pronoun ‘*Yuṣmat*’; and no significance is meant to be attached to the
special Nominative-ending (in the term ‘*tvam*’ here used). In actual
usage, speaking to their superiors, people make use of such forms as
‘*Yuṣmāsu*’ the Plural form (in the Locative).

‘*Should bathe and fast*’—which moans the dropping of the morning-meal.

‘*Having saluted*’—fallen on his feet,—‘he shall *propitiate him*’—make
him give up his anger—and then take his meal.—(204)

**(verses 11.204-206)**

*Parāśara* (11.49-50).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.292).—‘For addressing one’s elder with such
disrespectful terms as “*Tvam*” and “*Hum*,” for defeating him in a
discussion, or for binding him with a cloth, one should immediately
appease him and fast during the day.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 1185).—‘For addressing unspeakable words to a
Brāhmaṇa, the expiation ordained is that the man should perform the
*Kṛcchrātikṛcchra* penance and appease the insulted person by falling at
his feet; and for tying a cloth round his neck, the expiation prescribed
is that the man shall fast for three days and appease him by falling at
his feet. If one falsely calumniates the Brāhmaṇa, or injures him, he
shall fast for one day, or for three days, or for six days, according to
circumstances.’
