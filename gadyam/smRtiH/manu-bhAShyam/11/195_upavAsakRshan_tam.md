The mention of ‘Emaciation’ implies that he is to drink only a small
quantity of milk.

‘*Humble*’—sitting on his knees on the ground.

‘*They*’—the learned Brāhmaṇas—shall ask him—‘O friend, *dost thou
desire equality with us?*’ and add—‘If so, you should never again
disobey the scriptures, and accept improper gifts, through greed.’ When
tints addressed, the man should say—‘forsooth’ (as prescribed in the
following verse).’—(195)
