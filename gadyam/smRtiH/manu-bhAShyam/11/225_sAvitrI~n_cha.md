‘*Sāvitrī*’—*i.e*., the *Gāyatrī* verse, ‘*tatsavituḥ*, *etc., etc*.’
This text is everywhere spoken of as ‘*Sāvitrī*’ (sacred to *Savitṛ*,
the Sun), on account of *Savitṛ* being its presiding deity.

‘*Purificatory texts*’—(l) *The ‘Aghamarṣaṇa Hymn*,’ (2) the ‘*Pāvamānī
Hymn*’ and (3) the ‘*Puruṣa-Sūkta*’; as also the *Sāman*
texts—‘*Śukriyā*,’ ‘*Rauhiṇeya*,’ ‘*Adhyāyajana*’ (?) and so forth.—In
connection with the performance of all forms of *Kṛcchra*.

‘*With due care*’— intently.

‘*This shall be done, etc*.’ has been added only for the purpose of
tilling up the metre; as it is well-known that it is only such a man
that can be entitled to the performance of penances.—(225)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1230), which notes that in all
these penances, the capacity of the penitent is to be taken into
consideration;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 748);—and in the *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Prāyaścitta 38a).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (28.46).—‘Let him sing *Sāmans or* mutter the *Vyāhṛtis*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.309).—‘The reciting of the following sacred texts is
destructive of all sins:—The *Śukriyā*, the *Āraṇyaka* and the
