The ‘oblations into Fire’ are those spoken of in the texts
‘*Hṛdayasyāgre*, etc.’

‘*Finally*’— after the oblations have been finished,—he shall offer
oblations to the Maruts, to Indra, to Bṛhaspati and to Agni, with the
verse ‘*Samāsiñcantu marutaḥ samindraḥ sambṛhaspatiḥ sañcāyamagniḥ
siñcatu prajayā ca dhanea* (?) *ca*’ (Atharva-Veda Saṃhitā, 7.33.1).

Since the precise ‘deities’ of sacrifices are always those indicated by
the words of the *mantras* used at them, the words ‘*vāta*’ and ‘*guru*’
of the text should be taken as standing for ‘Maruts’ and ‘Bṛhaspati’
respectively. Hence when the offerings are actually made, the words
pronounced should be ‘*Marudbhyaḥ svāhā*’ and ‘*Bṛhaspataye svāhā*,’—and
not ‘*vātāya svāhā*’ and ‘*gurave svāhā*.’— (119)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 909), which notes that
(*a*) according to *Aparārkā* the ‘*ājya—homa*’ should begin with
‘*Vātāya svāhā*’ and end with ‘*Vahnayesvāhā*’ and after these
‘Principal offerings’ there should be one more offering of *Ājya* with
the mantra ‘*Samāsiñcantu etc*.’—(*b*) while according to
*Smṛtimañjarī*, after the ‘Principal offerings,’ the offering of
clarified butter with the mantra ‘*Samasiñcantu etc*.’ should be made to
Suvarchala and other deities;—so that in view of these two views, this
is a case of option.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 436);—and in
*Aparārka* (p. 1140), which adds the following notes:—The first
offerings to be made are the offerings of *Ājya* with the mantras
‘*Vātāya svāhā*’ and so forth;—the time for the offering is the ‘night,’
and that on the *Amāvāṣyā* day.
