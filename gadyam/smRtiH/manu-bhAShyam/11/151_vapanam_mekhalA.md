‘*Vows*’—are understood to be those laid down in connection with Vedic
study. But this is not right; since those vows have been laid down with
a view to proper *study*, and hence there could be no possibility of
their coming in on the occasion of Re-initiation. \[So that the rule
declaring their omission would be redundant\] Hence the ‘vows’ in the
present context should be understood to be those that are set before the
student in such words as—‘Do not sleep during the day,’ ‘Fetch fuel in
the morning and in the evening,’ ‘Be obedient to the Preceptor,’ and so
forth. It is these that are omitted on the Re-initiation.—(151)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (p. 556);—in *Aparārka* (p.
1075);—in *Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 37), as laying down in what respects the
expiatory sacrament differs from the ordinary initiatory sacrament;—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 104), which says that all this refers to things
that had come into contact with wine sometime in the past;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla p. 325).
