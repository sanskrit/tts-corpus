‘*Mines*’—places where gold and other precious things are obtained.

‘*Superintending*’—control obtained under royal commands.

‘*All*’—implies the inclusion of other sources of income also, *e.g*.,
control over villages and towns, investigating law-suits and
administering criminal law.

Similarly ‘*mechanical works*’ stand for the building of bridges and
embankments for regulating the flow of water; the undertaking of such
works also is a minor offence.

‘*Destroying*’—Cutting—‘*medicinal herbs*’—before they are dry.

‘*Subsisting on women*’— That is, maintaining oneself and family on the
property of women, or making a living out of prostitutes.

‘*Malevolent rites*’— Killing one’s enemies by curses or incantations or
sacrificial rites prescribed in the Veda.

‘*Sorcery*.’—Using incantations for gaining control over persons.—(63)

‘*Mahāyantrapravartanam*’—‘Executing great mechanical works, *e.g*.,
constructing dams across rivers in order to stop the flow of water’
(Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘making machines
for the killing of large animals, such as boars’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘making
such machines as sugar-mills and the like’ (Nandana).

‘*Stṛyājivaḥ*.’—‘Subsisting on one’s wife’s earnings by making her enter
service’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana);—‘by turning her into a harlot’
(Kullūka);—‘maintaining oneself by the separate property of his wife’
(Medhātithi);—‘living on money obtained by selling his wife’
(Rāghavānanda).—Nandana who reads ‘*hiṃsrauṣadhistṛyupājīvaḥ*’ (for
‘*hiṃsauṣadhīnām stṛyājīvaḥ*’), explains the compound as ‘subsisting
either on money earned by the sale of noxious herbs, or on the earnings
of one’s wife.’

This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 192), which has the
following notes—‘*Sarvakareṣu adhīkāraḥ*,’ employment in
mines,—‘*mahāyantrapravartanam*,’ working of oil and other mills, or of
machines for the sharpening of weapons and so forth,’—‘*auṣadhīnām
hiṃsā*,’ destroying the crops,—‘*stṛyājīvaḥ*,’ living on the earnings of
women,—‘*abhicāra*,’ doing of *japa*, *homa* and such acts with the
motive of bringing harm to others,—‘*mūlakarma*,’ rites for captivating
other persons and such other purposes.
