This expiation is meant for those cases where wine is taken as medicine
when life is in actual danger;—though winedrinking in such circumstances
has been permitted by certain texts.

In connection with the case where wine has been drunk unintentionally,
it is going to be laid down that the man should pass through the
sacramental rites over again, and also perform the ‘*Taptakṛcchra*’
penance.

Others take this verse to apply to the case of the drinking of the
‘*Gauḍī*’ and ‘*Mādhvī*’ liquors; as another *Smṛti* text has declared
that—‘For drinking wine other than that got from grains, one should
perform the *Cāndrāyaṇa* penance.’

‘*Once*.’—This applies both to ‘pieces of grain’ and ‘oilcake’;—‘*at
night*.’

‘*Hair-cloth*’—cloth made of the hair of the cow or the goat.

‘*With his hair matted*’—only at the top—or over the whole head.

‘*With a sign*’—such as a keg of wine and so forth.—(92)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.254), which adds that this refers
to a case where wine has been drunk by mistake and then vomitted;—again,
as referring to a case where the, wine has been taken unitentionally but
thrown out, after it has merely touched the palate.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 412), to the same
effect,—*i.e*. as referring to a case where the wine has only touched
the palate;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 9b);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 98), which says that this refers either to cases
of *unintentional* but repeated drinking of the *Gauḍī* and *Mādhvī*
wines, or to those of *intentional* drinking, only once, of those wines.
