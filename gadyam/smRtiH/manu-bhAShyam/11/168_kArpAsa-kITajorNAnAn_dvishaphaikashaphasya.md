<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijātā* (p. 875);—and in *Mitākṣarā*
(3.265), which notes that, since the expiation is thrice as heavy as
that prescribed in 165, it should he understood as referring to the
stealing of the things mentioned, when their value is three times that
of the single meal.
