He should offer himself as the target, when archers are practising. Or,
ho may invite, in battle, the strokes of the weapons of the armed men.

‘*By his own will*.’—This shows that if he happens to go to the place
and he struck dead only by chance,—this would not purify him.

‘*Cognisant*’— who knows that the man is exposing himself as an
expiation. Or, it may mean that, they should be well-versed in the
Science of Archery.

‘*He may throw himself into fire*, *thrice*.’—Rising, he should throw
himself again and again, three times.—(73)

“According to the Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, which Kullūka and Rāghavānanda quote,
these two penances and that mentioned in the next verse are to be
performed by a Kṣatriya who slew a Brāhmaṇa,—those ending in death by an
offender who, himself destitute of good qualities, killed a learned
*Śrotriya*, and the lighter ones by an eminent king who unintentionally
caused the death of a worthless Brāhmaṇa.” (Buhler).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 405), which
adds that the various alternatives here laid down are to be understood
to vary with such circumstances of each case as that of the act being
intentional or otherwise, the person killed being learned or ignorant
and so forth;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1060), which explains ‘*viduṣām*’ as
‘persons prescribing the expiation for him’; and adds that in the
absence of such persons he should voluntarily make himself the target of
persons who may be engaged in fighting.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.244) as indicating that there is freedom
of choice for the man who has committed the offence;—again under 2.247,
where the meaning is explained as the man should throw himself into the
fire by plunging into it headlong three times.
