‘*Refugee*’—He who, on being harassed by his enemies, or struck by some
powerful person, seeks refuge with a person saying ‘save me,’—or a man
who has committed an offence and comes to a learned man saying—‘save me,
tell me what expiation I should perform.’ Both these would be
‘refugees.’

‘*Ungrateful men*’—Those who forget the benefit that has been conferred
upon them by some one, and try to injure him,—or one who spoils the
effect of the benefit he has himself conferred upon some one, and tries
to undo it by doing him harm. Though both these men would be
‘*kṛtaghna*’ in the literal sense, yet in ordinary usage the name is
applied to one who causes injury to his benefactor.

In this connection, there is no consideration of caste,—the only
condition is that the persons murdered are^(‘)children’ and the like.

‘*Women*’—Even though they be unchaste. Though in these cases the
expiation shall be light, yet association with them is directly
forbidden by the words of the text.

‘*Association*’—Keeping company, living together.—(190)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1209), which remarks that the
phrase ‘*viśuddhānapi dharmataḥ*’ clearly indicates that the expiations
laid down in connection with the murder of women and other crimes do
really serve to remove the sin involved.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 155), as indication
of the view that in the case of heinous crimes, even after the
prescribed expiration has been gone through, the offender is not fit for
being associated with, even though for all spiritual purposes he may
have become ‘purified’;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 21);—and in
*Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 109), which explains ‘*na saṃvaset*’ to mean
that ‘one should not associate with them in eating or any such act.’

*Viṣṇu* (54.32).—‘Let him not however, associate with those who have
killed children, or with ungrateful persons, or with those who have
tilled a woman, or one who came to him for protection,—even though such
sinners may have secured absolution according to the Law.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.299).—‘Those who have killed a person seeking
protection, or a child or a woman, or those who are ungrateful,—with
these one should not associate, even though they may have performed the
requisite penances.’

191	Let him not dwell together with the murderers of children, with those who have returned evil for good, and with the slayers of suppliants for protection or of women, though they may have been purified according to the sacred law.
