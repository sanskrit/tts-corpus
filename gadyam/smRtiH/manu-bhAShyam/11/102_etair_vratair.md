“Inasmuch as only two modes of purification have been mentioned
above—‘the thief becomes purified by death, and also by penance,’—the
plural number in ‘these *penances*,’ does not appear to be right”

This same use of the plural number is indicative of the fact that there
are other expiations also, which have not been mentioned,—to be
determined by the considerations of the circumstances attending each
case.

‘*Gurustrīgamanīyam*’ means that of which *intercourse with the
Preceptors’s wife is the incentive*;—*the cause* is often regarded as
the *prayojana*, the *incentive*, which *prompts* or *brings about* the
effect—(102)
