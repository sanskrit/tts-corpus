At the same time as stated above, he shall drink water and other
things,—in quantities just enough not to satiate him. In some places we
find the exact measure laid down—‘of water he shall drink three *palas*,
of clarified butter, one *pala*, of milk he shall drink two *palas*, and
of hot air, three *palas*.’

‘*Bathing once*.’—This is an exception to the general rule that one
shall bathe thrice during the day and thrice during the night.—(214)

This v erse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 735), which explains the
meaning to be that ‘he should live for three days each upon water, milk,
and clarified butter and air’;—thus the penance being Completed in
twelve days;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 511), which says that the
‘drinking of hot air’ is done by inhaling the vapour emanating from hot
milk; and that this penance is completed in *twelve* days;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 782);—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 7).
