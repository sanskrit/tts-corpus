What is here prescribed is to be done in connection with all offences.

In the case of all Homa-offerings, clarified butter is the material to
be offered, whenever any other special substance is not prescribed.

‘*Himself*.’—This precludes the alternative of having it performed by
others.

Now we proceed to consider the question whether or not this offering is
to be made in the *ordinary* fire, in the case of one who has not set up
his own ritualistic fire. But first of all the question to be considered
is why the offering should be made into a *fire* at all. What the name
‘*Homo*’ etymologically indicates is only the act of *offering* ending
with the *throwing* of the material; so that into whatever receptacle
the material may be thrown, the act of ‘*Homa*’ would be duly
accomplished. Hence the Homa-offering may be made either on the ground,
or in water or in fire. But for one who has set up the ‘domestic fire’
this offering shall not be made into the *ordinary* fire; as the
offering of *Homa* in ordinary fires has been forbidden for such a man.
It might be argued that—‘the necessity of fire is deduced from actual
usage.’ But in that-case, it would be necessary to find out what the
actual usage is. The authors of *Gṛhyasūtras* have laid down the Homa as
to be offered, in connection with the performance of the *Kṛcchra*
penance,⁻ by persons who have set up the ‘domestic fire,’ and from this
it follows that in the case also of one who has. not set up the fire,
the performance of the *Kṛcchra* by way of penance cannot be done with
out the *Homa-offering*. For the man who has not set up the fire, there
are no Homa-offerings, when the said penance is performed *for* *the
purpose of bringing about prosperity* (and not by way of an
expiation);—the desired result being obtained only by the performance of
the act itself complete in its own details.

‘*Harmlessness*.’—He shall not beat even such pupils and others who may
deserve chastisement.

‘*Truthfulness*.’—Even in joke, he shall not utter an untruth.

These two virtues, already known as conducive to the welfare of men, are
here laid down as forming essential factors in the expiatory penance.

‘*Ārjava*’ is absence of harshness.—(222)

*Gautama* (26.6-11).—‘He who desires to be purified quickly, shall stand
during the day and sit during the night; he shall speak the truth; he
shall not converse with any one but Aryans; he shall daily sing the two
*Sāmans*...... He shall bathe in the morning, at noon and in the
evening, reciting three sacred texts... Next, he shall offer libations
of water.’

Do. (27.5-7).—‘He shall offer libations of water and oblations of
clarified butter, consecrate the sacrificial viands and worship the
moon, reciting the verses...... He shall offer clarified butter reciting
the four verses...... And at the end he shall offer pieces of fuel
reciting the verse...’

*Baudhāyana* (3.8.3, 7-14).—‘Having shaved his hair...... dressed in new
clothes and speaking the truth, he shall enter the fire-house... Heaping
fuel on the fire... he offers oblations... to Agni... to Agni
Sviṣṭakṛt...... Having drunk water, he offers additional oblations......
gives a cow as the fee and worships the sun.’

223	Burnt oblations, accompanied by (the recitation of) the Mahavyahritis, must daily be made (by the penitent) himself, and he must abstain from injuring (sentient creatures), speak the truth, and keep himself free from anger and from dishonesty.
