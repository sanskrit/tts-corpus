This same method shall be adopted in the ‘Yavamadhyama’ penance, but beginning it in the bright half of the month; and it is with a controlled mind that one should perform the ‘Cāndrāyaṇa’ penance.—(217)

In the ‘*Yavamadhyama*’ the man shall fast on the New-moon day and then
take one morsel on the first (of the bright half), two on the second,
and so on, till fifteen are taken on the Full-moon day; then beginning
with the first of the dark half of the month, he shall reduce it by one
morsel daily, till there is fasting again on the New-moon day.—(217)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 241), which
notes that this is the ‘Barley-shaped’ *Cāndrāyaṇa* as distinguished
from the ‘ant-shaped’ one described in the preceding verse. \[When the
penance begins on the first day of the brighter fortnight it is called
‘Barley-shaped’, and when begun on the first day of the bright
fortnight, it is called ‘Ant-shaped’. In verse 216, *Aparārka* and
*Madanapārijāta* read *śukle kṛṣṇe*, ma king the beginning in the
brighter fortnight\];—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 516).
