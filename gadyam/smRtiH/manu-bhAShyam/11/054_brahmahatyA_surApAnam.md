(*a*) Intercourse with the Preceptor’s wife, (*b*) Theft, and (*c*)
Association with outcasts,—these are ‘*heinous offences*’ for all
castes;—‘wine-drinking’ is so only for the Brāhmaṇa.

^(‘)*Theft*’—stands here for the stealing of gold belonging to a
Brāhmaṇa; as is clear from another Smṛti text, which says that—‘The
stealing of Brāhmaṇa’s gold constitutes a *heinous offence*.’ The term
‘*pātaka*’ (offence) literally signifying ‘that which degrades,’ is
applied to all transgressions, major as well as minor, and, in the name
‘*mahā-pātaka*,’ the qualifying epithet ‘*mahā*’ is meant to indicate
the great seriousness of the offence.

‘*Association with these*’—with any one of them; details regarding this
are going to be described under 180 below.—(54)

[*Cf*.
9.235.]

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta*, (p. 786).—in *Aparārka*, (p.
1044), which adds that ‘*surā*’ stands here for the ‘*Paiṣṭī*’ *i.e*.,
liquor distilled from grains;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*, (prāyaścitta,
3b);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*, (p. 39 and 140).

[\[See
above.—9.235.\]]

*Gautama* (21.1).—‘The slayer of a Brāhmaṇa, he who drinks wine, the
violator of the Guru’s bed, he who has connection with the female
relations of his mother and of his father, or with sisters and their
female offspring, he who steals gold, an atheist, he who constantly
repeats reprehensible acts, he who does not cast off persons guilty of a
crime causing loss of caste and he who forsakes blameless relatives,—all
these become outcasts.’

*Āpastamba* (1.21.7-8).—‘Stealing gold, crimes whereby one becomes
accused, homicide, neglect of the Vedas, causing abortion, incestuous
connection with relations born of the same womb as the mother or the
father, and with the offspring of such persons, drinking wine, and
intercourse with persons whose intercourse is forbidden; these are
actions that cause loss of caste.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.19-21).—‘They state that there are five *Mahāpātakas*:
stealing gold, the violation of Guru’s bed, drinking *Surā*, slaying a
learned Brāhmaṇa, and associating with outcasts, either spiritually or
matrimonially.’

*Viṣṇu* (35.1-2).—‘Killing a Brāhmaṇa, drinking wine, stealing
Brāhmaṇa’s gold, and sexual connection with a Guru’s wives are
*Mahāpātakas*; also social intercourse with such criminals.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.227).—‘Brāhmaṇa-slayer, wine-drinker, stealer (of
gold), violators of Guru’s bed; these are the *Mahāpātakins*, as also
one who associates with these for one year.’
