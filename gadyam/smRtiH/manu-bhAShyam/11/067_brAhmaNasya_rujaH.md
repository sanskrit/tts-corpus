‘*Causing pain*.’—Inflicting physical suffering with a stick or with the
hand.

“What is it *that should not be smelt*? There is no prohibition of the
*smelling* of anything, as there is of *eating*.

Nor does it follow that what should not he *eaten* is also what should
not be *smelt*. Because butter and other things got together for
sacrificial performance are what should not he *eaten*,—and yet these
are not held to be what should not be smelt.” Our answer to this is as
follows.—Such things as garlic, onion, human excreta and the like, on
account of their foul smell, cause pain to the olfactory organ; and it
is these things that are meant; and since ‘wine’ is also mentioned in
this context, those tilings also are meant to be included the *eating*
whereof has been forbidden. But rotten wood and such things are not
meant

‘*Cheating*’—dishonesty; an unclean heart; saying one thing, doing
another and thinking of a third.—(67)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.242);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
924);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyascitta 30a);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 42 and 464), which explains ‘*rujaḥ kṛtyā*’ as ‘causing
pain,’—‘*aghreya*’ as garlic and the like,—‘*jaihmyam*’ as dishonest
dealings with friends,—‘*Maithunam puṃsi*,’ as ‘vulgarity.’

*Viṣṇu* (38.1-6).—‘Causing pain to a Brāhmaṇa, smelling at things that
should not he smelt, or at wine, dishonest dealing,—sexual intercourse
with cattle, or with a man, or unnatural connection with a woman,—these
are crimes leading to loss of caste.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.1-8, 12).—‘The following offences cause loss of caste:
sea-voyage, stealing a Brāhmaṇa’s property or a deposit, giving false
evidence regarding land, trading with merchandise of any description,
serving Śūdras, begetting a son on a Śūdra woman, and thereby becoming
her son. The following: minor offences cause loss of caste—intercourse
with females who should not be approached, etc., etc. (sec under
58-66).’
