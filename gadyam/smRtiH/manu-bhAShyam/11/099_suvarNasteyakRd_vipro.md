<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is the expiation for stealing gold belonging to a Brāhmaṇa.

The term ‘*brāhmaṇa*’ is meant to include all castes; as is dear from
the fact that no other expiation has been prescribed for the Kṣatriya
and other castes.

‘*Punish me*.’—‘Inflict the proper punishment on me.’ The man shall go
to the King and tell him this.

The word ‘*King*’ here stands for the Sovereign of the country,—but one
who is of the Kṣatriya caste.—(99)

**(verses 11.99-102)

[\[See above
8.314-316.\]]

*Āpastamba* (1.25.10).—‘Those who have stolen gold, drunk wine or
violated the *Guru’s* bed, but not those who have slain a Brāhmaṇa,
shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food, bathe at the time of the
three libations, passing the day standing and the night sitting. After
the lapse of three years, they throw off their guilt.’

*Viṣṇu* (52.1-3).—‘He who has stolen gold must bring a club to the King,
proclaiming his deed; whether the King kills him with it, or dismisses
him unhurt, he becomes purified. Or in the case he did it unawares, he
shall perform the *Mahāvrata* for twelve years.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.257-258).—‘One who steals Brāhmaṇa’s gold should hand
over a club to the King, proclaiming his deed; whether killed, or let
off, by the King, he becomes pure, if he does not report it to the King,
he shall he purified by performing the penance laid down for the drinker
of wine;—or he must give away to the Brāhmaṇa his own weight in gold.’
