As the elephant made of wood, as the deer made of leather, so the non-learning Brāhmaṇa,—these three merely bear their names.—(157)

इयम् अध्ययनाध्येतृस्तुतिः। काष्ठमयो दारुणा[^४०६] यः क्रियते क्रकचादिना हस्त्याकृतिः, स यथा निष्फलः, न हस्तिकार्यं राज्ञां शत्रुवधादि करोति, एवं यो ब्राह्मणो नाधीते स काष्ठतुल्यः, न क्वचिद् अधिकारी । **चर्ममयो मृगः** चर्मविकारो ऽन्यो ऽपि यो मृगः स निष्फलो नाखेटकादिकार्यं करोति । **त्रय एते** नाममात्रं **बिभ्रति**, न तस्यार्थम् ॥ २.१५७ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse praises learning and the learner.

‘*Made of wood*’;—the form of the elephant made of wood by means of the
said and other implements; just as this is useless, does not serve any
useful purpose for the king, in the shape of killing his enemies and so
forth,—so the Brāhmaṇa who does not learn is like a piece of wood, not
fit for anything.

‘*The deer made of leather*’;—similarly the deer that has been made out
of leather is useless; it is of no use for purposes of limiting, etc.

‘*These three only bear their names*’—and do not fulfil what is
signified by these names.—(157)

‘*Kāṣṭhamayo hasti*’—“Probably allusions to old stories. *Cf*. the
*Bṛhatkathā* for the ‘wooden elephant’... In Mahābhārata the same idea
is expressed in slightly different words (12. 30. 40 ff.) and with added
similes.” (Burnell-Hopkins).

*Baudhāyana*, 1.1-11,  
*Parāśara*, 8-16,  
*Vaśiṣṭha*, 3.12,  
—Reproduce the words of Manu.

*Mahāhhārata*, 12.3.6-46.—(Same as Manu, but reading ‘*bibhrati*’ for
‘*dhāraka*.’)

157	As an elephant made of wood, as an antelope made of leather, such is an unlearned Brahmana; those three have nothing but the names (of their kind).
