‘*He who, for seven days*’—consecutively, ‘*has omitted to beg alms and
to offer fuel to the Fire,—without being ill*’—while not suffering from
any disease,—‘*shall perform the rites prescribed for the
Anakīrṇin*’;—*i.e*., the expiatory rite the exact form of which is going
to he described in Chap. 11?. (verse 118).

This is said here only for the purpose of showing the gravity of the
offence; and it does not mean that the rite mentioned is to he actually
performed in expiation of the omission. That this is so is shown by the
fact that another *Smṛti* has laid down a much simpler expiation for
this omission, *viz*.: ‘offering of clarified butter, etc.’ The
following fact also is another indicative of the same conclusion:—If
what is mentioned here were a real expiatory rite, then on the occasion
of mentioning the conditions under which the ‘*Amkīrṇin-rite*’ are to be
performed as an expiatory rite, the author would have mentioned these
omissions also, in the same way in which he has mentioned ‘sexual
intercourse with women.’

Some people interpret this verse to means as follows:—“It is necessary
to do the two acts (of begging alms and offering fuel) for seven days
only; having done them for seven days, if one drops them, there is no
harm in this; and these seven days are to be the first ones after
Upanayana.”

This however is not right; as it would lie in direct contravention to
the direction that ‘this should be done till the Final Return from the
teacher’s house,’—as also to what follows in the next verse.—(187)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 438) as
laying down the *Avakīrṇivrata* (actually prescribed in 11.118 in
connection with the loss of chastity on the part of the Student) as
applicable to other omissions also;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p.
485), in support of the view that the Begging of Alms is not optional,
but compulsory, since the present verse prescribes an expiation for its
omission, which clearly implies that the omission is sinful;—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 498) to the effect that the omission of Begging
alms involves sin; and again on page 500, where it is explained that the
expiation here prescribed is to be performed in the event of repeated
omissions;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (p. 1345, on 3. 281), where it is
explained as laying down an expiation for those cases where the duty of
‘fire-tending’ is omitted without any such extenuating circumstance as
being occupied with some other duty.

*Nirṇayosindhu* (p. 190) quotes it as laying down the expiatory rites
due on the omission of the duties laid down for the Student.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1142) as laying down the expiation for
omitting the said duties, without sufficient reason;—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 111) to the effect that alms-begging is an obligatory
duty;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 357).

*Baudhāyana* (1.2.5).—‘There is sin in omitting the alms-begging, sin in
the non-kindling of fire; one who omits these for seven days should
perform the *Avakīrṇi-vrata*.’

*Viṣṇu* (28.52)—(reproduces Manu’s words).

187	He who, without being sick, neglects during seven (successive) days to go out begging, and to offer fuel in the sacred fire, shall perform the penance of an Avakirnin (one who has broken his vow).
