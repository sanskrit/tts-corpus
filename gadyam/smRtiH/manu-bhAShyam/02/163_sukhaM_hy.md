One who is scorned sleeps in comport and wakes up in comfort and goes about in the world in comport; it is the scorner that perishes.—(163)

पूर्वस्य विधेर् अर्थवादो ऽयं फलदर्शनार्थः । सो ऽवमानान् न क्षुभ्यति स **सुखं शेते** । अन्यथा द्वेषेण दह्यमानो न कथंचिन् निद्रां लभते । प्रतिबुद्धश् च तच्चिन्तापरो न **सुखं** विन्दति । उत्थितश् च शयनात् कार्येषु **सुखं चरति** । यस् त्व् अवमानस्य कर्ता स तेन पापेन **विनश्यति**[^४११] ॥ २.१६३ ॥

The present verse is commendatory of the injunction contained in the
preceding verse, and it serves the purpose of indicating the result
proceeding from what has been enjoined.

He who is not perturbed by dishonour or scorn ‘*sleeps in comfort*’:
otherwise he would be burning with resentment and would not get any
sleep; and on waking up, he would still be thinking of the dishonour,
and would find no comfort. On rising from sleep, he moves about his
business in comfort.

That person however who has done the scorning perishes by that very
sin.—(163)

163	For he who is scorned (nevertheless may) sleep with an easy mind, awake with an easy mind, and with an easy mind walk here among men; but the scorner utterly perishes.
