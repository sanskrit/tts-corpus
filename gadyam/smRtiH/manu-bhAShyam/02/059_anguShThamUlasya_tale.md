The part of the palm at the root of the thumb they call ‘the receptacle dedicated to Brahmā’; that which is at the root of the finger ‘Sacred to Prajāpati’; that on the finger-tops ‘dedicated to the Gods’; and that which is below these two ‘dedicated to the Pitṛs.’—(59)

The ‘root’ of the thumb is its lower part; and the part, of the hand
just below that root is the ‘receptacle dedicated to Brahmā.’—The term
‘*tala*’ stands for the inner part (the palm). That inner portion of the
hand which extends up to the long palm-line and faces one’s own eyes is
the part ‘dedicated to Brahmā.’

That at the root of the fingers, above the horizontal palmline is
‘dedicated to Prajāpati.’

‘*That on the tip of the fingers is dedicated to the Gods*’—Even though
the term ‘*aṅguli*’ forms the subordinate factor in the compound
(‘*aṅguli-mule*’), yet it is construed with the term ‘*agre*,’ for the
simple reason that this latter is a relative term (and hence stands in
need of a correlative).

‘*That below these two is dedicated to the Pitṛs*.’—This also is to be
construed with the terms ‘*aṅguli*’ and ‘*aṅguṣṭha*,’ though both of
these form subordinate factors in the two compounds. The ‘finger’ meant
here is the index-finger. Hence it is the part below the thumb and the
index-finger which is ‘dedicated to the Pitṛs.’

We interpret the text in this manner on the strength of what is
prescribed in other Smṛtis, and also upon that of the practices of
cultured people; specially as no sense could be got out of the words as
they stand. Says Śaṅkha—‘Below the thumb and behind the first palm-line
is the receptacle dedicated to Brahmā; that between the thumb and the
index-finger is dedicated to the Pitṛs; that below the little finger is
dedicated to Prajāpati, that at the tip of the fingers is dedicated to
the Gods.’—(59)

‘*Aṅgulimūle*’—‘at the base of the little finger’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda);—‘at the base of the fingers’ (Medhātithi and Nandana)

*Medhātithi* (p. 101,1. 8)—‘*Tathā ca Śaṅkhaḥ*’—Though Medhātithi
appears to be quoting the very words of *Śaṅkha*, the actual passage
from Śaṅkha reads as follows:—

> kāyaṃ kaviṣṭakāmūle tīrthamūktammanīṣibhiḥ  
> aṅguṣṭhamūle ca tathā prājāpatyaṃ vica?ṇai \|  
> aṅgus?yagre sthitaṃ daivaṃ piś?yaṃ tarjanimūlake \|

Here ‘*Kāya*’ is distinguished from ‘*Prājāpatya*’ *Vīramitrodaya* also
cites Medhātithi as quoting Śaṅkha’s text.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 77), which offers
the following explanation—‘*anguṣṭhamūla*’ means the lower part of the
thumb; and on the palm-side of this is the ‘*Brāhma-tīrtha*.’ ‘*Tala*’
is the *palm*; and that part of the palm which extends from the base of
the thumb to the first long line in it constitutes the
‘*Brāhma-tīrtha*’; and the part which lies between the base of the
fingers and the long line parallel to them is the ‘*Kāya-tīrtha*’;—and
at the tip of the fingers lies the ‘*Daiva-tīrtha*.’—The term ‘*agre*’
is to be construed with ‘*aṅguli*,’ which is the predominant factor in
the compound ‘*aṅgulimūle*.’—‘*Pitryam tayoradhaḥ*.’—Here also ‘*tayoḥ*’
stands for the two terms ‘*aṅguli*’ and ‘*aṅguṣṭha*’; and the particular
‘*aṅguli*’ or ‘finger’ meant here is the ‘*fore-finger*; so that the
‘*Pitrya-tīrtha*’ would be ‘below’ the thumb and the forefinger.—The
words of the text as they stand, if taken literally, do not yield any
sense; that is why recourse has been taken to the more or less indirect
construction, as explained above.
