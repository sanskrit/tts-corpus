When the pupil is going to study, the Teacher, ever free from indolence, should say—‘ho, read!’ and he should cease when he says ‘let there be a stop!’—(73).

‘*When going to study*’ and the other expressions have already been
explained before. The present verse adds a direction for the Teacher.
When a boy is desirous to read the Veda from a Teacher, he should be
invited with the words ‘ho, read!’ Until he is so invited, the Boy
should not press the Teacher with such importunate requests as—‘please
teach us this chapter!’ Another *Smṛti* has declared—‘One should study
on being invited to do so’. (Yājñavalkya, Ācāra, 27).

Saying the words ‘*let there be a stop*,’ ‘*he should
cease*’—desist,—‘who is to cease?’—The Teacher; as is clear from the
nominative case-ending used. Or, it may be taken to mean that the
*pupil* should cease only when dismissed by the Teacher, and not
according to his own wish; the construction of the passage in this case
being—‘when the Teacher says *let there be a stop*, then the pupil
*should cease*.’

Other people have explained this rule regarding the time of ceasing as
applying to all readers—the pupil as well as the Teacher. And this is in
accordance with another *Smṛti*, which says—“Having recited the Veda, at
the time of ceasing, one should touch the ground with the fore-finger
and pronounce ‘*svasti*’ in the case of the Yajurveda, ‘*vispaṣṭām*’ in
the case of the Sāman, ‘*virāmaḥ*’ in the case of the Ṛgveda and
‘*āramasva*’ in the case of the Atharva.”

‘*Free from indolence*’—without sloth; ‘indolence’ is *sloth*;—the man
beset with sloth is called ‘indolent’; and when he has given it up he is
called ‘*from indolence*.’ This is meant to be merely descriptive.
‘Indolence’ here does not mean *fatigue*. The present text should never
be taken to mean that what is here laid down is for only one who is free
from indolence, while for those beset with indolence there is some other
rule.—(73)

Nārāyaṇa and Nandana read ‘*adhyeṣyamāṇastu gurum etc*,’ which
means—‘the pupil, proceeding to study, shall say to his Teacher etc.,
etc.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 136), where the
verse is explained to mean that—‘each day at the beginning of the
teaching, the Teacher should begin the work with the word ‘*Ho! read*;’
and at the end, should finish with the words ‘*Let there he a stop*;’
and it adds that all this is to be done for the purpose of ‘pleasing
God.’

The verse is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 100);—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 521);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 514);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 52);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 142),
which explains *ārame* as ‘should desist from teaching.’

*Gautama- Dharmasūtra*, 1. 52.—‘Clasping the left, foot with his hand,
he should address the request to him—*pray read*.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra*, 1.3.10,13,15.—‘When one desirous of learning
meets a learned man, he should obtain his permission and then proceed to
read; and having approached near the teacher, he should read after
having requested the teacher to *please read*.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 514).—‘Regularly rising in the
morning, he should cleanse his teeth, bathe, pour libations into fire;
then the man should carry on teaching.’

*Āpastamba* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra).—‘One should avoid teaching on the
bed; he should never teach on the bed whereupon he sleeps.’

073	But to him who is about to begin studying, the teacher always unwearied, must say: Ho, recite! He shall leave off (when the teacher says): Let a stoppage take place!
