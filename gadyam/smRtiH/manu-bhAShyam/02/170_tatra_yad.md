‘*Among these*’—above-mentioned births;—that which is ‘*Brahmic
birth*’—i .*e*., U panayana—‘*which is marked by the tying of the*
*girdle*,’—which is symbolised by the tying of the girdle made of
*Muñja-grass*; at this ‘*Sāvitrī is his mother*,’—*i.e*., it becomes
accomplished by the expounding of the Sāvitrī-mantra. This shows that in
the whole Upanayana ceremony, the expounding of the *Sāvitrī* is the
most important factor; it is for this purpose that the child is ‘brought
near’ (*upa-nīyate*). ‘*The Teacher is his father*.’

Birth is always brought about by the Father and Mother; hence
metaphorically the Teacher and the Sāvitrī hare, been described as
‘father’ and ‘mother.’—(170)

The Upanayana has been described as ‘*marked by the tying of the
Girdle*’; and this might be understood to mean that it is on acoount of
tying the girdle that the Teacher is to be honoured like the father;
hence the next verse is added

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 335), as laying
down that the Upanayana constitutes the ‘*brahmajanma*,’ ‘brahmic’ or
‘Vedic’ ‘birth.’ The compound ‘*brahmajanma*’ is expounded as ‘*brahmaṇā
vedena gāyatrīrūpeṇa janma iva*,’—i. e. the rite which is like *birth*,
through the *Brahman* or *Veda*, in the form of *Gāyatṛī*;—*i.e*. it is
a rejuvenation brought about by the sanctificatory rite. The idea of
this being a ‘birth’ has been spoken of in the Śruti
also—‘*Gāyatryā-brāhmaṇamasṛjat tṛṣṭubhā rājanyam jagatyā vaiśyam na
kenachicchandasā śūdram*—That the term ‘*brahma*’ (in the compound
‘*brahmajanma*’) does not stand for the *whole Veda* is made clear by
the qualification ‘*mauñjībandhana-chihnitam*,’ ‘marked by the tying of
the girdle—this tying of the girdle being done immediately after the
imparting of the *Gāyatrī*, and not after the whole Veda has been taught
It goes on to add that this same fact has been stated by Medhātithi
negatively, in the passage ‘*tayāhi anuktayā tanna niṣpannam bhavati*,
(until the Gāyatrī has been imparted, the Upanayana is not
accomplished). \[This passage occurs on p. 153, 1. 22 of Medhātithi,
where however the reading found is *tanniṣpannambhavati* ‘It becomes
accomplished by the expounding of the *gāyatrī*’ (Translation, p. 459);
which is a *positive*, and not a *negative*, assertion, though the
meaning is the same in both cases\].—The conclusion therefore is that
the name ‘*Upanayana*’ pertains to the *imparting* *of the
Gāyatri-mantra*.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 59) as supplying the
reason for regarding *Upanayana* as a second ‘birth.’

*Śruti* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 335).—‘With the Gāyatrī, he created

Vaiśya; and the Śūdra without any Vedic verse.’

170	Among those (three) the birth which is symbolised by the investiture with the girdle of Munga grass, is his birth for the sake of the Veda; they declare that in that (birth) the Sivitri (verse) is his mother and the teacher his father.
