It is the nature of women that they make men fall off from their
fidelity: by associating with men, women would make them deviate from
their vow.

For this reason the wise are never ‘*unguarded*’; *i.e*., they shun
women from a distance;—‘unguardedness’ would consist in touching her and
so forth.

It is in the very nature of things that a young woman, when touched,
produces a disturbance in the mind; and this mental disturbance itself
has been interdicted, to say nothing of other vulgarities.

‘*Pramadā*’ means *woman*.—(213)
