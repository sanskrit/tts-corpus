The preceding verse has laid down the ‘fatherly treatment’ (of a
youthful teacher); the present verse supplies, in its support, a
descriptive eulogy of the kind called ‘*Parakṛti*.’ The ‘*son of
Añgiras*,’—‘*Kavi*’ by name,—‘*the child*,’ youthful ‘*His
fathers*’—*i.e*., his paternal and maternal uncles; the sons of these,
and other elderly persons, equal (in dignity) to the father.

‘*Taught*,’—instructed.

Whenever occasion arose for calling them, he called them with the words
‘*little sons*, come here.’

‘*Having received and trained them*’—*i.e*., having accepted them and
made them his pupils.—(151)

‘*Parigṛhya*’—‘Having excelled’ (Nandana);—‘having received and trained’
(Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda).

‘*Pitṛn*’—‘The Agniṣvāttas and the rest’ (Nārāyaṇa).

Burnell remarks that the sentiment here expressed, though supported by
Baudhāyana, 1. 3. 47, is opposed to Āpastamba 1.13. 15.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p. 480);—and in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 305).

*Medhātithi* (p. 144, 1. 13)—‘*Arthavādoyam parakṛtināmā*’—There are
several classifications of Arthavāda passages. The one referred to here
is that into the four kinds—(1) ‘Stuti’ (2) ‘Nindā’, (3) ‘Parakṛti’ and
‘Purākalpa’—mentioned in the Nyāyasūtra of Gautama (2. 1. 65), under
which Vātsyā-yana gives examples of each kind:—(1) ‘*Stuti*’,
Valedictory—is the name given to that text which eulogises a certain
injunction by describing the desirable results following from the
enjoined act;—(2) the text that describes the undesirable results
following from the act is willed ‘*nindā*’, ‘Deprecatory—(3) the text
that describes a contrary method of action adopted by a certain person
is called ‘*parakṛti*’, ‘illustrative—and (4) that which describes a
method as adopted traditionally is called *Purākalpa*, ‘Narrative’.

Another classification of the Arthavāda is into three kinds—(1)
Descriptive by indirect implication, (2) Descriptive by direct
intimation and (3) Descriptive of an accomplished fact

The *Mīmāṃsā-bāla-prakāśa* (pp. 48-58) describes no less than 38 kinds
of Arthavāda (see Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā, pp. 115-116)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.93).
