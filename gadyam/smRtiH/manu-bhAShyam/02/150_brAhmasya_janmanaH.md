The ‘birth’ that is for the purpose of getting up the Veda is called
‘*Vedic birth*,’—*i.e*., the Initiatory Rite.—He who brings about this;
and ‘*he who teaches him his duty*—instructs him in it, by expounding
the meaning of Vedic texts,—such a Brāhmaṇa,—‘*even though he be a
child*.’—becomes tho father of the old man. That is, even though the
pupil be older in age, he should treat the teacher as his father.

*Question*.—“How can the younger man ‘initiate’ the older? Specially as
initiation is performed in the eighth year; and until one has duly
learnt and studied the Veda, he is not entitled to act up to the
injunction of ‘becoming a teacher.’”

*Answer*.—Well, in that case, we can take the term ‘*Vedic birth*’ to
mean not necessarily the Initiatory Ṛte, but only the getting up of the
Veda. *One who* ‘*brings about*’ this—*i.e*., the *Teacher*,—and ‘*he
who teaches*’—expounds—‘*him his duty*’—*i. e*., the meaning of the
Vedic texts,—‘*becomes his father*.’

‘*In law*;’—this means that the treatment of the father should be
accorded to him; so that what the phrase ‘*in law*’ means is that the
parental character of the teacher is based upon the treatment accorded
to him. The ‘treatment of the father’ has not yet been declared as to be
accorded to the teacher and the expounder; hence it has been laid down
here; in the same manner as the injunction that ‘the Kṣatriya should be
treated as the Brāhmaṇa.’—(150)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 31);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 305) in support of the view that when a boy teaches an old
man, the former is his superior;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
480).

**(verse 150-154)  
**

*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra*, 2-48.—‘This is found in the case of the infant
Āṅgirasa.’

*Sūtasaṃhitā*, 6-31.—‘To regard the Teacher as a *child* or a *human
being* or an *uncultured person*,—is the result of ignorance.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 6.22-23.—‘Learning is superior to all; since it
forms the very basis of Dharma.’

*Viṣṇu-smṛti* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 305).—‘One should behave towards the
Teacher,—be he a child or of the same age as oneself,—as towards the
Guru.’
