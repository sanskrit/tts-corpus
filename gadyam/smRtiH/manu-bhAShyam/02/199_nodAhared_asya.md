<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*He should not pronounce*’—should not utter—‘*the teacher’s name*.’

‘*Mere*’—*i.e*., bereft of such honorific titles as ‘*Upādhyāya*,’
‘*Ācārya*,’ ‘*Bhaṭṭa*’ and the like;—‘*even behind his back*.’

‘*Nor should he mimic*’—should not imitate him, like an
actor;—‘*gait'*—(saying) ‘thus does my teacher walk’;—‘*speech*’—*i,e*.,
swiftly, slowly, at a medium pace and so forth;—‘*deportment*’—‘thus he
eats,’ ‘thus he hinds his turban,’ ‘thus he roams about,’ and so forth.

What is prohibited here is imitating the teacher in a joking
spirit.—(199)

‘*Kevalam*’—Such titles are always to be added as ‘*Upādhyāya*’ or
‘*Bhaṭṭa*’ or ‘*Ācārya*’ (Medhātithi),—‘*ācārya*’ (Kullūka),—‘*caraṇa*’
(Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 492) in support of
the view that whenever the teacher’s name has got to he pronounced, it
should he accompanied with such honorific titles as ‘*upādhyāya*’ and
the like;—also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 1 06);—in *Aparārka* (p. 56);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 42), which says that the name should not be
uttered *by itself* (*kevalam*), it should always he accompanied by some
such title as ‘*upādhyāya*’ and the like;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 121).
