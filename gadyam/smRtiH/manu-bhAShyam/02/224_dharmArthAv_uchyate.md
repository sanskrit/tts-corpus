Spiritual merit and wealth are called “good”; or pleasure and wealth; or spiritual merit alone, or wealth alone is “good”; but the truth is that it is the aggregate of the three.—(224)

In a friendly spirit, the Author now proceeds to explain what it is that
is praiseworthy, which, when carried into practice, does no harm either
visible or invisible, and which is called ‘good’ in ordinary parlance.

What is stated here is not founded on the Veda, nor is it an explanation
of the denotation of words, as we have had before in the case of such
words as ‘preception’ and the rest. The fact of the matter is that when
a man acts he seeks to obtain something ‘good’; and the Author is going
to explain that such and such a thing is the ‘good’ for the sake of
which man acts.

On this point he puts forward the different opinions that have been
held.

\(1\) Some people have held that *spiritual merit and wealth are “good*”
‘Spiritual merit’ consists in the due observance of the Injunctions and
Interdictions contained in the scriptures. ‘Wealth’ consists in cattle,
lands, gold and so forth. These alone constitute “good”; since man’s
happiness depends upon them.

\(2\) Another opinion is that ‘*pleasure and wealth*’ constitute the
“good.” Pleasure is the one thing desired by men; hence pleasure is the
“good and wealth also, since it is conducive to pleasure. The *Cārvākas*
(Atheists) have declared that “Pleasure is the one end of man, and
wealth is the means to it, as also is ‘Spiritual Merit,’ if there is
such a thing.”

\(3\) \[The third opinion is that\] Spiritual Merit is the highest
‘good’ of all,—all this being based upon that. To this end it has been
declared that ‘from Spiritual Merit proceed Wealth and Pleasure.’

\(4\) That Wealth is the sole ‘good’ is held by tradesmen aud
professionals.

\(5\) The real truth is that it consists in ‘*the aggregate of the
three*’ Hence it follows that one should attend to Wealth and Pleasure
also, but only such as are compatible with Spiritual Merit, and not such
as are contrary to it. So says Gautama (9.46)—‘One should, as far as
lies in his power, make his mornings, middays and evenings fruitful with
Spiritual Merit, Wealth and Pleasure.’

‘*Aggregate of three*’;—*i.e*., a group consisting of three factors.
That is, the name ‘good’ is applied by convention to the three taken
together.—(224)

Hopkins remarks “*four* schools are noted but he ignores the fifth,—the
Siddhānta—‘*trivargamiti tu sthitiḥ*’ ‘the truth is that it is the
aggregate of the three.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 158), which adds that *Dharma*,
*Artha* and *Kāma* are the ‘group of three’;—this constitutes the
‘*Śreyaḥ*’, which one should constantly bear in mind as the aim to be
attained.

*Gautama* (9.48.49).—‘Either the morning or the midday or tho evening,
he shall not make devoid of merit, wealth and pleasure;—from among these
he should regard merit as the highest.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.1).—‘The investigation of Dharma for the good of man.’

*Viṣṇu* (1.8).—‘Merit is the essence of all.’

*Āpaslamba Dharmasūtra* (1.20.3).—‘When a man does what is meritorious,
wealth follows.’

224	(Some declare that) the chief good consists in (the acquisition of) spiritual merit and wealth, (others place it) in (the gratification of) desire and (the acquisition of) wealth, (others) in (the acquisition of) spiritual merit alone, and (others say that the acquisition of) wealth alone is the chief good here (below); but the (correct) decision is that it consists of the aggregate of (those) three.
