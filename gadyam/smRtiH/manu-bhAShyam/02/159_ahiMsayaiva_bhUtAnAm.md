‘*Without injury*’—without beating.

‘*To living beings*’—i.e., to one’s wife, children, servants, pupils and
brothers;—‘*teaching for good should be imparted*.’ The generic term
‘beings’ has been used with a view to guard against the notion that what
is stated here should he done to *pupils* only. ‘*Śreyas*’ ‘*good*’
stands for the acquiring of seen and unseen results; the ‘*teaching*’ is
for the purpose of that acquisition; and it consists either in
instruction without the help of hooks, or in the teaching and expounding
of the scriptures.

What the present verse means is that, as far as possible one should
avoid too much heating and chiding; some slight chastisement has been
already permitted under Gautama 2. 42. 43.

*Question*.—“How then are they to he kept in the right path?”

The answer is supplied by the next line:—‘*Words sweet*’—gentle and
loving;—‘*soft*’—*i.e*., even when gentle, they should not he very loud
or haughty or harsh like that, of the crow. *E.g*., ‘dear child, read
on,—do not direct your attention elsewhere,—attentively finish this
chapter quickly and then you can immediately proceed to play with boys
of your own age.’ He who does not pay attention, even after being thus
spoken to—for him the proper method has already been laid down—‘by means
of a bamboo-piece.’

‘*Should he employed*’—spoken.

‘*By one desiring merit*’;—*i.e*., only by so doing does he acquire the
full merit of teaching.—(159)

*Gautama*, 2.49-50.—‘The training of the pupil should be done without
hurting him; in case of this being impossible, the chastisement should
be inflicted by means of a thin rope or a thin piece of split bamboo.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra*, 1.8.28-29.—‘In the case of the pupil committing
some fault, the Teacher should admonish him; and until the pupil
desists, the following punishments may be inflicted in accordance with
the gravity of the offence: threatening, fasting, water-bath, refusing
to see him.’
