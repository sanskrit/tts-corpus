This describes the reward in connection with the entire body of
injunctions bearing upon service; and it is commendatory of learning the
Veda by means of serving the Teacher.

Just as a certain man digging the earth by a spade, or some such
implement, obtains water,—and he does not obtain it without trouble;
similarly the pupil who is eager to serve—and attends upon him—acquires
the learning that is in the Teacher.—(218)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 525) as laying
down the method of acquiring learning;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 139) as describing the results accruing from serving the Teacher.

*Baudhāyana* (1.2.5).—‘All Vedas enter into him who learns and behaves
thus; just as fire supplied with fuel shines brightly, so shines he who
knowing this follows the life of the Religious Student.’

*Vyāsa Smṛti* (1.36, 37).—‘In this manner, living, from day to day, on
alms, the Religious Student should keep his vows; speaking agreeably,
avoiding.calumny,-, always accomplishing the needs of his teacher; from
beginning to end of his Vedio Study, he should constantly attend upon
him; studied in this manner, the Vedic Mantra carries the Brāhmaṇa
forward.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (1.14.5).—‘Service of the Teacher is the only
means.’

*Nārada* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 525).—‘Knowledge is acquired by
service of the Teacher, or by much wealth, or by knowledge (in
exchange); there is no fourth means;—the white ants rear up a huge heap
by collecting small particles of dust: it is not strength that
accomplishes this but only effort; gradually and slowly is learning
acquired, gradually and slowly are riches attained, gradually and slowly
is the hill ascended, gradually and slowly is the rags-cover made up;
and gradually is the journey accomplished.’

218	As the man who digs with a spade (into the ground) obtains water, even so an obedient (pupil) obtains the knowledge which lies (hidden) in his teacher.
