That teacher who *benefits* a pupil *means of knowledge*,—‘*more or*
*less*’—this is an adverb;—‘*him also*’—who helps with a little
knowledge only—‘*one should regard as the mentor*.’

The following construction is better:—‘*yasya śrutasya*’—these are in
apposition—*i.e*., of the knowledge of the Veda, or of the Vedic
subsidiaries, or of other Sciences, or of Reasoning and Art—*alpam vahu
vā*—*tena*—this has to be supplied—*upakaroti*’ \[The meaning, by this
construction being—‘that knowledge by a little or more of which he
benefits him, etc., etc.’\]

The word ‘*śrutopakriyayā*’ is an appositional compound the apposition
being based upon the fact of the ‘knowledge’ being the means of the
‘benefit.’

What is meant by this is that the teacher referred to should be called
and treated as a ‘mentor’: just as we haver had above in the case of the
terms ‘*Ācārya*’ and the rest.—(149)

‘*Iha*’—‘In these Institutes’ (Kullūka);—‘in the section on salutation’
(Govindarāja). It may also mean, as Buhler rightly suggests, ‘in this
world’.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā*, as applying the title ‘*guru*’ to
the mere *Upādhyāya* or sub-teacher;—also in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
81);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 477);—in *Aparārka* (p. 65) as
laying down that such a person deserves to be simply *respected*;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 89), to the effect that all that is meant
by such a person being called ‘*guru*’ is that ‘he deserves to be
honoured’, as is indicated by the particle ‘*api*’;—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 353);—and in *Prāyaścitta-viveka* (p. 12) in support of the
view that the Father alone is not entitled to be called ‘*guru*’.

*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 303) quotes it as supporting the view that
the name ‘*guru*’ is applied to persons other than the Father only
figuratively or indirectly. To the same effect it is also quoted in the
same work in the Prāyaścitta section (p. 259) as describing the
*secondary ‘guru*’.

See above, verse 142.

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 1-12.—‘Also because he expounds the Veda,’

*Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti*, 3.24.—‘He who teaches a portion of the Veda and the
Vedic subsidiaries is the *Upādhyāya*.’

*Atri*, 9-10.—‘There is no substance in the world by giving which one
could become freed from the debt owing to that Teacher who teaches even
a single syllable to his pupil. One who honours not the Teacher who has
taught him even a single syllable (is a sinner).’

*Yājñavalkya*, 1-34.—‘He who teaches a portion is the *Upādhyāya*: he is
a *Guru* who, having performed the rite, imparts to him the Veda.’

*Hārīta* (see under 142).

149	(The pupil) must know that that man also who benefits him by (instruction in) the Veda, be it little or much, is called in these (Institutes) his Guru, in consequence of that benefit (conferred by instruction in) the Veda.
