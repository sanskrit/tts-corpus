‘*A part of the Veda*.’—The Mantra only or the Brāhmaṇa portion
only;—Or, without the Veda itself, only the Vedic subsidiary
sciences;—he who teaches this,—and also even the whole Veda, (but)—‘*for
a living*,’—*i.e*., not prompted purely by the injunction of ‘becoming a
preceptor,’—he is an *Upādhyāya*, a ‘Sub-teacher,’ not an Ācārya,
‘Preceptor.’

He who may teach even the entire Veda to a pupil initiated by another
person, is not a ‘Preceptor’; nor is he a ‘Preceptor’ who, having
initiated a pupil, does not teach him the entire Veda.

“If the *teaching of a portion of the Veda* is made the distinguishing
feature of the ‘Sub-Teacher,’ and the *Initiating* is the characteristic
of the ‘Preceptor,’—then what would be the character of that person who
does *not* do the initiating, but teaches the *whole* Veda? He would be
neither a ‘Preceptor’ (since he has not done the initiating), nor a
‘Sub-teacher’ (as he has not taught only a *portion* of the Veda). Nor
has any other name been heard of for such a teacher.”

Our answer is as follows:—According to what is going to be said in 149
such a person would be the ‘Teacher,’ ‘*Guru*,’ Who is inferior to the
‘Preceptor,’ but superior to the ‘Subteacher.’

The terms ‘*api*’ ‘*punaḥ*’ in the Text only serve to fill in the
metre.—(141)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra p. 304), as defining
the *Upādhyāya*, the Sub-teacher, in view of the declaration that the
‘*Ācārya*’ is equal to ten ‘*Upādhyāyas*’;—also in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 477), which adds the following notes—‘*Ekadeśam*’—*i.e*.
either the Brāhmaṇa portion alone, or the Mantra-portion
alone;—‘*Vṛttyartham*’—for his own livelihood.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 30) having quoted the verse adds—*Ekadeśam*—of the
Veda, *i.e*. either the *Saṃhitā*, or the *Brāhmaṇa* or subsidiary
sciences;—he who teaches any *one* of those either *without payment*,—or
with payment (without previously stipulating for it),—is an
‘*Upādhyāya*.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 65), as providing the definition of
*Upādhyāya*;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 45);—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 91), which explains ‘*vṛtti*’ as *living*.

141	But he who for his livelihood teaches a portion only of the Veda, or also the Angas of the Veda, is called the sub-teacher (upadhyaya).
