He should not beg for food from his Teacher’s family; nor from the family of his paternal or maternal relations. But when other houses are not available, he should avoid the preceding in preference to the succeeding.—(184)

Even though the Teacher’s family may fulfil the aforesaid conditions,
yet ‘he should not beg for food’ from that family. ‘*Kula*,’ ‘*family*,’
stands for ‘relations’; hence one should not receive alms from the uncle
and other relations of the Teacher.

‘*Paternal relations*’—from the family of those related to the student
on his father’s side.—‘*From his maternal relations*’—*i.e*., from his
maternal uncle and others.

This verse should not be construed in such a way as to connect the words
‘paternal relations, etc.,’ with the *Teacher*; since the Teacher’s
relations have all been included under the term ‘*Teacher’s family*.’

“From whom then is he to beg for food?”

From houses other than those here mentioned.

‘*When other houses are not available*’—*i.e*., not possible;—when, for
instance, the entire village is inhabited either by the Teacher’s
family, or by his own paternal and maternal relations; and there are no
other families;—or even though they are there, they do not give him
alms;—then the student may beg from those just mentioned; when, others
are uot available, he should first beg from his maternal relations; if
these latter be not available, then from his paternal relations; and
when even these arc not available, then from the Teacher’s family.—(184)

‘*Vihāyasi*’—In the air, *i.e.* on the roof of the house (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘on a platform’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘in the open air
(Nandana);—‘in any pure place except the ground’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 451), as laying
down the method of ‘tending the fire’, and ‘explains it that ‘he should
place the fuel somewhere in the open, not on the grouhd;’—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 936) as laying down the morning and evening offerings
into the Fire;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 448), where ‘*dūrāt*’ is
explained as from a spot not owned

*Gautama* (2.44-45).—‘Food should be begged from the house of the
Ācārya, or one’s relations, or the Guru; from one’s own family, only in
the event of its not being obtained elsewhere,—the succeeding one of
these being preferred to the preceding.’
