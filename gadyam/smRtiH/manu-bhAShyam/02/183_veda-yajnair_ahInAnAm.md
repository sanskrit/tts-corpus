‘*Who are not devoid of Veda and sacrifices*—who are equipped with Vedic
learning, and perform the sacrifices to which they are entitled;—‘*not
devoid*’ means *not without*, *i.e*., *fully equipped*.

‘*Famed for their deeds*;’—thoso who may not be entitled to the
performance of sacrifices, but who are accustomed to meritorious acts.
Or, those persons may be called ‘*for their deeds*’ who are content with
their own means of livelihood, and do not go in for such means of living
as usury and the like.

‘*From the houses of*’ these people ‘*he should fetch alms*’—*i.e*., beg
and bring it away.

‘*Pure*’—Clean.

‘*Daily*’—This is a descriptive reiteration.—(188)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 453) in support of
the view that alms are to be begged only from ‘praiseworthy’ persons;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 381), as laying down the special
qualifications of the Brāhmaṇas from whom the Brāhmaṇa Student is to beg
alms;—and in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 496) in support of the view that even
among people of his own caste, alms should be begged only from the
houses of specially qualified men.

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 59);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 60);—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p.

288), which adds the following notes:—Those who are not devoid of the
knowledge of one or two or three Vedas,—those who have not omitted to
perform the sacrifices,—and those who are carrying out in a praiseworthy
manner all the duties prescribed for them,—from the house of such
parsons, the Brahmacārī—ha who is keeping the vows for the sake of Vedic
study—keeping all the restraints and observances—should daily obtain
‘alms’—‘*bhaikṣam*’ being a collective noun;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 109).
