All the duties have been honoured by him who has honoured these three; and all acts remain fruitless for him who does not honour them.—(234).

**आदृताः** सत्कृताः । आदृतवचनेन प्रत्युपकारपरत्वं लक्ष्यते । यो ह्य् आदृतो भवति स परितुष्टः प्रत्युपकाराय यतते । अथ वा **आदृतः** परितुष्टः उच्यते । धर्मस्य चानन्त्यात् परितोषानुपपत्तेः फलदानोत्सुकत्वं लक्ष्यते । सर्वाणि तस्य कर्माण्य् आशु फलदायीनि भवन्ति । **यस्यैते त्रय आदृताः** शुश्रूषया परितुष्टाः । एतैस् त्व् अनाराधितैर् यत् फलकामेन किंचित् क्रियते शुभं कर्म तत् सर्वं निष्फलम् । **सर्वाः क्रियाः** सर्वाणि श्रौतस्मार्तानि कर्माणि । 

- अर्थवादो ऽयम् । पुरुषार्थो ह्य् आराधनविधिः । तदतिक्रमे पुरुषः प्रत्यवयन् महता पापेन कर्मोपार्जिते ऽपीष्टफलभोगे प्रतिबध्यते । अत उच्यते **सर्वास् तस्याफलाः क्रिया** इति ॥ २.२३४ ॥

‘*Honoured*’—respected. The mention of ‘honouring’ indicates that the
person honoured is intent upon repaying the benefits he has received. As
a matter of fact, the person who is honoured becomes pleased and tries
to repay it. Or, ‘*honoured*’ may be taken as standing for ‘pleased.’
And as Duties are endless, the entire satisfaction of these would not be
possible; so that what is indicated is ‘anxiety to bring about the
desired result’; hence what is meant is that ‘all acts done by him bear
fruit quickly.’

‘*By him who has honoured these three*’—who has satisfied them by his
service.

If these persons are not honoured, then whatever meritorious act the man
does with a view to reward remains fruitless.

‘*All acts*’,—*i.e*., rites performed according to *Śrauta and Smārta*
rules.

This verse is purely commendatory. The fact of the matter is that the
injunction of honouring the three persons aims at the accomplishment of
something desirable for man; so that by transgressing it the man would
incur a great sin, which would obstruct the fulfilment of any reward
that he might have won by his acts. It is with a view to this that it is
said that ‘*all his acts remain fruitless*.’—(234)
