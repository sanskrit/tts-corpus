One is not called ‘*venerable by the fact that his head has turned
grey*’;—*i.e*., the hairs of his head have become white. How then?

He who, ‘*though young*’—is of young age—and yet carries on his
study,—him ‘*the gods know*’—declare—‘*to be venerable*.’ The gods know
all things, hence this is a praise (of the learned man).—(156)

156	A man is not therefore (considered) venerable because his head is gray; him who, though young, has learned the Veda, the gods consider to be venerable.
