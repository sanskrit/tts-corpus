This injunction is meant for the Life-long Student.

In the absence of the Preceptor, he should continue to live in
residence, either with the Preceptor’s son, who is endowed with Vedic
learning and other qualities, or with the Preceptor’s widow, or with the
Preceptor’s ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’; and towards each of these he should behave as
towards his Preceptor; *i.e*., he should present to him the food he
obtains as alms, and so forth.

The term ‘*dārā*,’ denoting, has been regarded by grammarians as always
used with the plural ending; but writers on Smṛti use the singular form
also; *e.g*., ‘*Dharmaprajā-* *sampanne dāre nānyām kurvīta*’
(Āpaṣṭamba, 2.11.13).—(247)

‘*Sapiṇḍe*’.—The ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ is defined below in 5.60.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 458) as laying down
the duties of the life-long Student;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 109) in
support of the view that in the absence of the Teacher’s wife, the
Student should take up ‘residence’ with the Teacher’s *Sapiṇḍa*, and in
the absence of this latter also, he should betake himself to the
‘tending of Fire’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 549) to the effect
that ‘residence with Fire’ is to be taken up only in the absence of the
Teacher’s Sapiṇḍa;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 504), along with the
following verse;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 76) as referring to the ‘*Life-long*
Student’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 167), which says that
this refers to cases where no *Sapiṇḍa* is available.

*Gautama* (3. 7).—‘In the absence of the teacher, service should be
rendered to bis offspring.’

*Viṣṇu* (28. 44, 45).—‘On the death of the teacher, one should reside
with his son, as with the teacher himself:—or with the teacher’s wife,
or with others of the same caste.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1. 49).—‘In the absence of the teacher, he shall reside
either with his son, or with his wife or with his fire.’
