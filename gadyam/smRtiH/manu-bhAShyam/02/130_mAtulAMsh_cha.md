The plural number in the word ‘superiors’ indicates that this word does
not stand for those superior persons that are mentioned in the present
verse; it is meant to be a generic name, standing for persons superior
in the point of wealth, etc., as mentioned by Gautama (in 6.20).

These when they are ‘younger’—whose age is lower than that of the
nephew, etc.

‘*Here l am*’—indicates the name of the accoster; the term ‘I’ being
meant to come after the name.

When the said persons have arrived, one should rise to meet them and
accost them in the manner here prescribed. The present direction
prohibits the use of the vocative term ‘*bhoḥ*,’ ‘sir,’ in the greeting.
Gautama also has said—‘There should be rising to meet; these are not to
be saluted.’ (6.9).—(130)

‘*Gurūn*’—‘Superiors, in point of wealth, &c.’ (Medhātithi);—‘those
venerable on account of learning and austerities (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘the husband of a maternal aunt and so forth, but not
those more learned than himself’ (Govindarāja);—‘the teacher and the
rest’ (Nandana);—‘Subteachers’ (Nārāyaṇa).

*Medhātithi* (p. 133, 1. 27)—‘*Gautamīye*’—This refers to Gautama 6.9,
which reads—

> ṛtvikśvaśurapitṛṣyamātulānāṃ tu yavīyasāmprasyutthānamanabhivādyāḥ (?)

*Ibid*. (p. 133, 1. 28)—‘*Bhāgineyādeḥ*’—See Gautama, 6.20—

> vittabandhūkarmajātividyāvayāṃsi para?tīyāṃsi,

*cf*. also Manu, 2.136.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 456), where it is
explained that the term ‘*gurūn*’ stands for those who are possessed of
superior learning and other qualifications.
