Some persons (as noted above) have explained the term ‘*entire*’ (of the
preceding verse) to include the Subsidiary Sciences; and according to
this view, it might be thought that the study of these might be taken up
in any order one might choose, without any restriction; hence the
present verse proceeds to lay down a definite order,—*viz*., the Veda
should be learnt first, then the Subsidiary Sciences. Others have
however taken the term ‘entire’ to preclude the possibility of men being
content with the learning of parts only of the Veda; and according to
these, the ‘learning of the Veda’ naturally comes up first, after the
completion of the ‘*Traividya*’ observances (of the *Upanayana*) so that
(what the present verse means is that) until the Veda has been learnt,
the learning. of the Sciences cannot be permitted.

‘*The twice-born man*’—Brāhmaṇa—‘*who, not having learnt the Veda,
labours*’;—*devotes attention*—‘*over* *other subjects*,’ *i.e*.,—the
Subsidiary Sciences, or treatises on Reasonings—‘*falls, even while
living, to the state of the Śūdra*’—‘*soon*’—quickly,—‘*along with his
descendants*’;—*i.e*., accompanied by his son, grandson and other
descendants.

‘*Labour*’—is great effort. Since the absolute prohibition of labour
over the study of the Sciences cannot be intended, all that is meant is
that these latter are to be studied during the time available, after the
Veda has been learnt.

The mention of ‘*falling to the state of the Śūdra*’ is meant to express
excessive deprecation.

The use of the term ‘*twice-born*’ implies that the restriction herein
laid down regarding the rules of study applies to only one who has gone
through the Initiatory Rites; and before Initiation, the study of such
Subsidiary Sciences as of Phonetics, Grammar, and the rest as are not
interspersed with quotations from the Veda, is not prohibited.

“The study of the Subsidiary Sciences is implied by the Injunction of
Vedic Study; and this injunction is acted up to by the boy prompted by
his Teacher; so that before Initiation, there being no Teacher, how can
there be a study of the Subsidiary Sciences?”

There is no force in this objection. According to the assertion—‘the
child who is taught by his father they call efficient’—the Initiatory
sanctification might be performed by the father; who, before the
Initiation, will teach him the Science of Grammar and the rest.—(168)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p. 510) as declaring
the omission of Vedic study to be sinful; and adds that this text lays
down *directly* the compulsory character of the study, which has been
already *indirectly* indicated by the injunction of the compulsory daily
duties: and the effect of this direct declaration comes to be this that
the omission of the study (as a compulsory duty) involves sin; specially
as for this omission special expiatory rites have been prescribed.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 49) as declaring that there
is sin in the omission of Vedic study, which is a duty duly enjoined. It
is interesting to note however that this assertion has come from the
*Pūrvapakṣin*, and the *Siddhānta* view put forward is that what this
verse is pointing to is only that ante-natal sin which is the cause of
the sloth to which the omission of the study and such other duties is
due; and it is added that what the due performance of the obligatory
duty does is either (1) to maintain the ‘absence of sin’ or (2) to
destroy the said ante-natal sin.

The same work quotes the verse again, on page 140, in support of the
view that Vedic study is an *obligatory* duty.

The same work quotes it again in its Prāyaścitta section (p. 15) as an
instance of what is meant for the *male* only.

The *Madanapārijāta* (p. 102) simply quotes it among a number of other
texts laying down the thorough study of the Veda.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 129) to the effect that
Vedic study should be the very first care of the twice-born.

*Viṣṇu* (28.36).—‘He who, without having studied the Veda, labours over
other studies, becomes a Śūdra, along with his offspring.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3. 3)—(reproduces Viṣṇu’s words).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 511).—‘A Brāhmaṇa without the
Veda is not a Brāhmaṇa.’

*Śaṅkha* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra).—‘Until one has studied the Veda, he
should not study any other science, except the Vedic Subsidiaries.’

168	A twice-born man who, not having studied the Veda, applies himself to other (and worldly study), soon falls, even while living, to the condition of a Sudra and his descendants (after him).
