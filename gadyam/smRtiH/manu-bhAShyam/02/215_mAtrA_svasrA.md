अतो **विविकासनः** निर्जने शून्ये गृहादौ नासीत । नापि निःशङ्कम् अङ्गस्पर्षादि कुर्यात् । अतिचपलो हीन्द्रियसंघातो **विद्वांसम् अपि** शास्त्रनिगृहीतात्मानम् अपि **कर्षति** हरति परतन्त्रीकरोति ॥ २.२१५ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

For reasons above described ‘*one should not sit alone*’—in a solitary
room, etc., one should not sit; nor should he touch the body, etc.
Because the host of sense-organs is extremely fickle; and it
‘*overpowers*’—draws, makes helpless —‘*even the learned*’—*i.e*., the
person who has his mind fully controlled by wisdom acquired from the
scriptures.—(215)
