तथा **पराङ्मुखस्य** गुरोः संमुखोपविष्टः शिष्यः । यदि गुरुः परावृत्य कथंचित् स्थितः प्रेष्यति, तां दिशं गत्वाभिमुखीभूय पूर्वोक्तं कर्तव्यम् । **दूरस्थस्य** समीपं **अन्तिकम्** **एत्य** आगत्य प्राप्य । आसीनस्यापि **शयानस्य प्रणम्य** प्रह्वो भूत्वा गात्राण्य् अवनमय्य । **निदेशे** निकटे तिष्ठतो ऽपि प्रणम्यैव यत् प्राग् उक्तम् अभिगच्छन्न् इति ॥ २.१९७ ॥

‘*When the teacher has his face averted*,’—the pupil should sit facing
him; that is, if the Teacher happen to have his face turned the other
way when he gives his directions, the pupil should go over to the side
facing the teacher and then do the aforesaid (listening and conversing).

‘*When the teacher is at a distance*,’—the pupil should go near him,
approach him.

When the teacher is seated, as also when he is lying down, the pupil
should *bow down*— humbly bend his body low.

‘*Nideśe*’ means ‘close by’; when he is sitting close by, then the
aforesaid acts should be done after bowing low.—(197)

‘*Nideśe tiṣṭhataḥ*’.—‘Standing close by’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja,
Kullūka, and Rāghavānanda);—‘standing in a lower place’ (Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 106), where the following
explanation is added:—We have the form ‘*osyetya*’ (which is the reading
adopted by the writer) and ṇot ‘*syaitya*’ because of the Sūtra
‘*mānaśca*’;—‘*praṇamya*’ is to be construed with ‘*nirdeśe* (the
reading adopted by the writer) *tiṣṭhataḥ*’;—‘*nirdeśe*’ meaning *in a
lower place*, or, according to others *in a place close by*;—and in
*Aparārka* (p. 56).
