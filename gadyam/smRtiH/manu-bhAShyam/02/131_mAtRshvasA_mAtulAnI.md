These ‘*deserve to be honoured like the Teacher’s wife*’—by rising to
meet them, saluting them, offering them seat and so forth.

The equality of these to the Teacher’s wife haviug been already
mentioned by the phrase ‘like the Teacher’s wife,’ the addition of the
words ‘*they are equal, etc*,’ is meant to indicate that one should do
for these persons other things also;—such as carrying out their wishes
and so forth—that one does for the Teacher’s wifìe. If this were not so
indicated, the implication of the context would be that it is only in
the matter of salutation that they have to be treated ‘like the
Teacher’s wife.’

The text speaks of only ladies of older age; but in the case of younger
ladies also the same rule of salutation has to be observed.—(131)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 458) in support of
the view that the mother-in-law should be accosted with the clasping of
her feet, whereby the prohibition of clasping of the feet of the
mother-in-law, met with in some Smṛtis, has to be taken as referring to
eases where the mother-in-law happens to be a youthful woman,—under
which circumstances the Teacher’s wife also should not be clasped in the
feet.

and sister.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.14.6.9).—‘The Mother and the Father should be
attended upon like the Teacher;—on the completion of his study, he
should clasp the feet of all his elders;—also when he meets them on
returning from a journey;—in the case of brothers and sisters, clasping
of feet should be done in order of seniority.’

*Viṣṇu-Smṛti* (32.3).—‘Mother’s sister, father’s sister and the elder
sister also.’

*Smṛtyantara* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 458).—‘Feet-clasping should be
done of the mother’s sister, also of the wives of one’s paternal uncle.’
