The Father has been declared to be the Gārhapatya Fire, the Mother the Dakṣiṇa Fire, and the Preceptor the Āhavanīya fire; and this Triad of fires is highly important.—(231)

केनचित् सामान्येनायं पित्रादीनां गार्हपत्यादिव्यपदेशः । **साग्नित्रेता** आधानाग्नित्रेता या **गरीयसी** महाफला । त्राणं त्राणार्थम् इता प्राप्ता त्रेता इति शब्दव्युत्पत्तिः ॥ २.२३१ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The father, etc., have been called ‘gārhapatya’ and the rest by reason
of some sort of resemblance.

‘*This Triad* *of* *Fires*’—*i.e*., the three sacrificial Fires—‘*is
highly* *important*,’—*i.e*., conducive to great results.

The word ‘*treta*’ (*Triad*) is etymologically analysed as ‘*trāṇam
itā*’ which means ‘got up for the purposes of protection.’—(231)

“For the arrangement of these three fires, see the plan at the end of
the first volume of Haig’s Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, and that at page 191 of
Hillebrandt’s *Das Altindische Neu-und Vollmondsopfer*. These fires are
on circular, semi-circular and square altars respectively. For the same
comparisons, otherwise employed, see Āpastamba,
2.7.2.”—(Burnell—Hopkins).

This verse is quoted in *Prāyascittaviveka* (p. 128);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 95).

*Viṣṇu* (31.8).—‘The father is the Gārhapatya Fire; the Mother, the
Dakṣiṇāgni; and the Teacher, the Āhavanīya.’

*Mahābhārata* (12.108.7).—(Same as Manu.)

231	The father, forsooth, is stated to be the Garhapatya fire, the mother the Dakshinagni, but the teacher the Ahavaniya fire; this triad of fires is most venerable.
