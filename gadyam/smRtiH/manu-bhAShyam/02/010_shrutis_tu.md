The Veda should be known as the ‘revealed word,’ and the Dharmaśāstra as the ‘recollections’; in all matters, these two do not deserve to be criticised, as it is out op these that Dharma shone forth.—(10)


“Scripture is not authoritative; why then should contrariness to it be regarded as undesirable? That the scripture (Veda) is unauthoritative is proved by such discrepancies as (a) untruthfulness, (b) inconsistency and (c) repetition. 


(a) Such sacrifices as the Kārīrī (which is laid down as to be performed for obtaining rain) are performed by men desiring min, but as a matter of fact no rain comes after the performance. As regards the rain that might come at some future time, it has been well said—‘The Kārīrī having been performed during the autumn, when the cornfields were drying up, if the rain falls during the spring, this only leads to cattle-disease!’ Further, as regards the Jyotiṣṭoma and such other sacrifices, which are spoken of as bringing their rewards at some future time, since the acts will have completely disappeared after performance, the assertion that their reward would come after a hundred years would be exactly like the confident assertion of the Vampirist. From this it is clear that the Veda is untruthful, 


(b) There is ‘inconsistency’ also: when it is said ‘libations should be offered after sunrise,’ if it were offered before sunrise, it would be clearly wrong; as it is said—‘those who perform the Agnihotra before sunrise utter falsehood morning after morning.’ Then again, it is said ‘that the libations should be offered before the sun has risen,’ for (it is said) ‘the offering made after sunrise would be like the offering of reception to the guest after he had gone.’ Now in the former we have the injunction of offering after sunrise, and a deprecation of offering before sunrise, while in the latter we have the reverse. So that people are always in doubt as to which alternative they should adopt. 


(c) The same Agnihotra that is enjoined in one Vedic Rescension is found to be enjoined in another Rescension also; and it has been held (by the Mīmāmsakas) that the act, mentioned in the various texts, is one and the same (Agnihotra) And this is a clear Repetition.”

*Objection*:—“Is this a treatise on the meanings of words, a
lexicon,—like the works beginning with such words as *Ātmabhūḥ*,
*Parameṣṭhī* (are the names of Brahmā), and so forth,—that it is stated
that ‘Revealed Word’ means the *Veda*, and ‘Recollections’ means the
*Dharmaśāstra*?”

*Answer*:—In ordinary life, the ‘Practices of Cultured Men’ are not
regarded either as ‘Revealed Word’ or as ‘Recollection,’ on the ground
of their being not codified; codified treatises alone are known as
‘*Smṛtis*,’ ‘Recollections’; and it is for the purpose of declaring that
these Practices also are included under ‘*Smṛti*’ that the author has
set forth this verse.

‘*Dharmaśāstra*,’ ‘Dharma-ordinance,’ is that which serves the purpose
of ‘ordaining’ (teaching) Dharma as to be done; and ‘*Smṛti*’ is that
wherein *Dharma* is taught, *i.e*., laid down as to be done; and
codification or non-codification is entirely immaterial. Now as a matter
of fact a knowledge of what should be done is derived from the Practices
of Cultured Men also; so that these also come under ‘*Smṛti*.’ Hence
whenever mention is made of ‘*Smṛti*’ in connection with any matter, the
Practices of Cultured Men should also be taken as included under the
name.

“If all *Dharmaśāstra* (‘ordinance of Dharma’) is ‘*Smṛti*’ then the
Veda also, which is the ‘ordinance of Dharma’ *par excellence*, would
have to be regarded as *Smṛti*,”—with a view to preclude the possibility
of such an idea being entertained, the author has said—‘*The Veda should
be known as the Revealed Word*.’ Where the words conveying the ‘Teaching
of Dharma’ are directly perceived (heard), it is the ‘Revealed Word’;
while where the words of Teaching are only *recollected*, it is
‘*Smṛti*’; and since this latter condition is also fulfilled by the
‘Practices of Cultured Men,’ this latter also comes under ‘*Smṛti*’; as
a matter of fact, no authority can attach to any Practice, in
corroboration whereof a Vedic text is not ‘recollected.’

Or, the mention of the ‘Revealed Word’ may be explained as serving the
purpose of showing that the *Smṛti* is equal to the *Veda*.

*Question*:—“What is that common function of Revealed Word and
Recollection which rhe present verse seeks to attribute to the Practices
of Cultured Men?”

*Answer*:—‘*In all matters these two should not be criticised*’;—‘*These
two*’—*i.e*., Revealed Word and Recollection.—‘*In all matters*’—*i.e*.,
even in regard to apparently inconceivable things, such as are entirely
beyond the scope of those means of knowledge that are applicable to
perceptible things; *e.g*., (*a*) the same act of killing leads, in one
case, to good, and while in another case it leads to sin; (*b*) the
drinking of wine leads to Hell, while the drinking of Soma removes sin.
In such matters, we should not proceed to discuss the various *pros and
cons*. ‘*Criticism*’ consists in raising doubts and conceiving of
contrary views. For example—“If the act of *killing* is sinful, then
since the act of *killing* is the same in all cases, that done in the
course of Vedic sacrifices should also be sinful;—if the latter killing
is a source of good, ordinary *killing* also should be conducive to
good; the act being exactly the same in both cases.”

What is prohibited here is that ‘criticism,’ in which we conceive of the
form of an act to be quite the reverse of what is declared in the Veda,
and proceeding to examine it by means of reasonings based upon false
premisses, begin to insist on the conclusion thus arrived at. It is not
meant to prohibit such enquiry and discussion as to whether the *Prima*
*Facie View* or the *Established Thesis* is in due accord with the Veda.
That such an inquiry is not meant to be prohibited is clear from what
the author says later on—‘He alone, and none else, knows Dharma, who
examines it by reasonings.’ (Manu, 12.106)

*Question*:—“Is this *criticism* prohibited with a view to some
invisible (superphysical) results?”

We say—*no. Because it was out of these two that Dharma shone forth*.
\[This is what is intended by the said prohibition.\]

This assertion points out the fact that all the arguments, set forth by
casuists in support of things contrary to what is laid down in the Veda,
are fallacious. These arguments are of the following kind—“The killing
of animals in the course of Vedic sacrifices must be sinful, because it
is *killing*, like any ordinary killing.”—Now that *killing* is sinful
is learnt from no other source of knowledge except scriptures; under the
circumstances, no reason can be found to establish the sinfulness of
*killing* until the scriptures have been accepted as authoritative; and
when once the authority of the Veda has been admitted, it could not be
reasonable to bring forward arguments against it, as this would
invalidate the (acknowledged) authority of scriptures; and this would
involve self-contradiction: at first the scriptures were admitted to be
authoritative, and then subsequently they are held to be
un-authoritative; and this opinion would be contrary to the person’s own
previous assertion,—no casuist ever says ‘my mother is childless’; and
it is also contrary to the scriptures.

The Casuist might argue as follows:—

> “Scripture is not authoritative; why then should contrariness to it be
> regarded as undesirable? That the scripture (Veda) is unauthoritative
> is proved by such discrepancies as (*a*) untruthfulness, (*b*)
> inconsistency and (*c*) repetition.
>
> (*a*) Such sacrifices as the *Kārīrī* (which is laid down as to be

That there is no ‘untruthfulness’ in the Veda is what is meant by the
last quarter of the Verse (‘it was out of these that Dharma shone
forth’). Because out of the Veda ‘*Dharma alone*—*i.e*., only that a
certain act *should be done*, in the form of sacrifice,—‘*shone forth*,’
is expounded; and it does not say anything definite in regard to the
time at which the rewards shall appear; this is clear from the fact that
the passages that speak of rewards do not make mention of any time; all
that we learn from the Injunction is that a certain result shall follow,
and the Injunction does not specify the time. As a matter of fact,
divisions of time, past, present and future, are related to what is
expressed by the verbal root; while the *Result* is not denoted by the
verbal root at all; it is only implied by the Injunction; what is
denoted by the verbal root (*i.e*., the act of ‘sacrifice’) is actually
accomplished at the time (of the performance), in the form of the
offering of a substance for the benefit of a certain deity,—the
fulfilment of this offering appearing in the form of the transformation
of the substance offered (into the fire, for instance). Further in
ordinary life also, we find that when a person, who is an obedient
servant of another, is directed to go to a certain place, he at once
obeys the order; though as regards his wages, in some cases he may
obtain it at the very beginning; but also sometimes during the act, or
even after the act has been accomplished; and then also he may get them
on the same day, or the next day, or at some future time. In the same
manner, there is no limit as to the time at which the results spoken of
in the scriptures will appear; all that is meant is that (by the
performance of the act) the result, in the shape of Heaven, Rain or so
forth, is brought within reach,—and not (hat they appear on the very
same day. Then again, just as there are obstacles in the way of the
realising of results of acts done in the ordinary course of life, so
there are also in the case of the acts prescribed by the Veda,—such
obstacles consisting of past sins and so forth. This (possibility of the
Rain not coming immediately after the act) is clearly shown in the Veda
itself when it says ‘if the rain should not come, the man should
continue as before.’ And as regards the *Sarvasvāra* sacrifice (which is
laid down as leading the performer to heaven), people have explained
that the reward does not consist in the *immediate entrance to Heaven*,
in fact it consists in what the man actually desires, and the desire is
in the form ‘may I reach heaven without difficulty \[ *i.e*., after
death; immediate translation to heaven would mean immediate death, which
no man desires\].

As regards the argument that there is no difference in the act of
*killing* as done in ordinary life and as done during a Vedic
sacrifice,—what has to be borne in mind is the fact that the sinfulness
of the act of killing is known only from the scriptures, it is not
amenable to perception or any ordinary means of knowledge; and there is
certainly a difference: the ordinary *killing* is prompted by passion,
while the sacrificial *killing* is prompted by Vedic Injunction; and as
the killing of the animal offered to Agni-Soma is prompted by the Vedic
Injunction, this constitutes a great difference. From all this it is
clear that in the Veda there is nothing ‘untruthful.’

As regards ‘Inconsistency’ (which is the second point urged against the
Veda), the Author is going to answer it in the text itself (Verses 14-15
below).—(10)

For an interesting discussion regarding the *anṛtavyādhātapunaruktadoṣa*
attaching to the Veda, the reader is referred to Vātsyāyana’s Bhāṣya on
the Nyāyasūtra 2.1.58-63.

Medhātithi (p. 69, l. 4) ‘*Sarvasvāre tu vivādante*’—The *Sarvasvāra* is
an Iṣṭi sacrifice which is described as leading the sacrificer directly
to heaven; and in regard to this there is a difference of opinion among
Vedic scholars: some hold that entrance into heaven is not the actual
result, the result being the accomplishment of what the man
desires—*viz*., the fulfilment of his wish *to go to heaven without any
hindrance, whenever he may die*.

This has been quoted by the *Mitākṣarā* under 1.7, in support of the
view that the name ‘*Smṛti*’ is applied to the *Dharmaśāstra*.
