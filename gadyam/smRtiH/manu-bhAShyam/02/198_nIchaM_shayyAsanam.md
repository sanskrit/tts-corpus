‘*Low*’—not high; *i.e*., low in comparison with theTeacher’s.

‘*Always*’—*i.e*., also after the period of studentship.

‘*Within sight of his Teacher*’—*i.e*., where the Teacher sees—‘*he
should, not sit at ease*’; *i.e*., he should not spread his legs or
throw about his limbs, and so foch. ‘*Sit*’ stands for action in
general; the sense being that he should not do whatever he likes.—(198)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 491), where it is
added that this does not apply to carts and other such conveyances in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 106);—in *Aparārka* (p. 56);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 40 ), which explains the last clause to mean that ‘he should not
spread out his legs and so forth’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
120), which says that this refers to cases other than riding on a
bullock and so forth, where *sitting together* cannot be avoided.

*Gautama* (2.20, 21, 27).—‘In the presence of the teacher, the pupil

legs, spitting, laughing, yawning, cracking of fingers; he should sleep
on a lower level, always rising before and sleeping after the teacher.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1. 2. 21),—‘He should sit and sleep on the
ground.’

should not be unrestrained in his acts.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1. 6. 13).—‘He should worship the teacher as a
god, always attentive to him, never talking ill of him, never showing
him any disrespect.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1. 8. 8-10).—‘He should not sit on a higher
seat;—nor on one with several legs;—nor on that which is the most
honourable.’

sit as he likes.’

*Viṣṇu* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra,p. 491).—‘He should not sit on the same

conveyance.’
