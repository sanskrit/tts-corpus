अस्य प्रतिषेधस्यातिक्रमे दोषम् आह । **अधर्मेण** पृष्टो ऽन्यायपृष्टश् च **यः** प्रब्रवीति "एवम् एतद् उक्तम् अध्येतुम्" इति । **यश् च पृच्छति** । ताव् उभाव् अपि म्रियेते अप्राप्तकालौ । अथैको व्यतिक्रमकारी स एव म्रियते । यद्य् अन्यायेन पृष्टो न वक्ति तदा प्रष्टैव वाथ प्रतिवक्ति तदोभाव् अपि । अनेनान्यायप्रश्ने दोषदर्शनेन प्रष्टुर् न्याय्यः प्रश्नविधिः । **दिद्वेषं वा** द्वेष्यतां लोके प्राप्नोति ॥ २.१११ ॥

The present text describes the evil effects of transgressing the above
prohibition.

He who instructs a pupil—‘you should read this’—in an unlawful manner,
either when he is not asked, or when he is asked in an unlawful manner;
and be also who asks in an unlawful manner;—both of these die, before
time. If only one of them happens to be the transgressor, then he alone
dies. When asked in an unlawful manner, if the wise man docs not
explain, then the questioner dies; but if he does explain, then both of
them die. This indication of the evil effects proceeding from improper
questioning clearly implies that for the questioner also there is a
proper manner of putting questions.

‘*Or incurs the ill-will*’—enmity—of the people.—(111)

‘*Vidveṣam vādhigacchati*’—‘Incurs the ill-will of the people’
(Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘loses the reward’ (Rāghavānanda);—‘incurs
the other party’s enmity’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 516), as laying
down the duties of the Teacher.
