उक्तानि धर्मे प्रमाणानि । विरोधे च विकल्पो ऽभिहितः । अधिकारिणश् च सामान्येनोक्ताः । इदानीं येषु योग्यतया धर्मो ऽनुष्टेयताम् आपद्यते ते देशा वर्ण्यन्ते । **सरस्वती** नाम नदी । अपरा **दृषद्वती** । तयोर् **नद्योर्** **यद् अन्तरं** मध्यं **तं देशं ब्रह्मावर्त** इत्य् अनया संज्ञया **प्रचक्षते** व्यवहरन्ति शिष्टाः । **देव**ग्रहणम् अवध्यवधिमतोः स्तुत्यर्थम् । देवैः स निर्मितो ऽतः सर्वेभ्यो देशेभ्यः पावनतर इति ॥ २.१७ ॥

The sources of the knowledge of Dharma have been described; it has also
been stated that in cases of couflict there is *option*; persons
entitled to the performance of *dharma* have also been indicated in a
general way. Now the author proceeds to describe those countries that
are fit for the performance of Dharma, and where (on that account) it
becomes incumbent to perform it.

‘*Sarasvatī*’ is the river bearing that name. ‘*Dṛṣadvatī*’ is another
river; that which *lies between these two*, that region they call by the
name of ‘*Brahmāvarta*’; that is the region which the cultured speak of
by that name.

‘*Created by the Gods*’—is for the purpose of eulogising the boundaries
and the bounded region; the sense being that ‘the region is created by
the Gods, and is therefore more sacred than all other regions.’—(17)

The Aparārka quotes this verse along with verses 19,21 to 23, as
indicating the views that the ‘black antelope’ is to serve as a mark of
the ‘*yajñīya deśa*’ only in the case of the countries *other than those
described in these verses*. This verse and verses 18 to 22 have been
quoted in the *Madanapārijāta* (p. 12) in support of the view that the
‘Custom’ or ‘Right Behaviour’ that is to be regarded as authoritative
and trustworthy is that prevalent among the people inhabiting the tract
of land herein defined.

Other writers, among whom are Vaśiṣṭha and Śaṅkha define ‘*Āryāvarta*’
as that tract ‘where the black antelope roams’; which, according to Manu
(2.23) is the characteristic feature of the ‘*yajñīya deśa*’ ‘land fit
for sacrificial acts’.

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Vrata, p. 27),—in the *Vīramitrodaya*
(Paribhāṣā, p. 55), which explains that the epithet ‘*devanirūpitam*,’
‘created by the Gods,’ is only meant to be eulogistic;—in the
*Dānamayūkha* (p. 7),—and in the *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 4).
