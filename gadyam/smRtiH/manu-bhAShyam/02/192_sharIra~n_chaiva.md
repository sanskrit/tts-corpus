<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

On coming from some other place, ‘*he should stand looking at the face
of his Teacher*,’—he should not sit;—‘*having under control*, *his
body*’;—*i.e*., he should not do such acts as the throwing about of
hands and feet, laughing and so forth; nor should he speak anything
needlessly.

He should control his ‘*organs of sensation*,’—*i.e*, if he finds
anything wonderful near the Teacher, he should not think of it again and
again. He should control the Auditory and other organs also; the control
of the visual organ is secured by looking at the Teacher’s face.

He should control the mind also; *i.e*., he should avoid the thought of
difficulties pertaining to soriptural matters, or of the building of
houses, granaries and the like.

The prohibition contained under 288 with regard to ‘making an effort to
control, etc.,’—is meant to prohibit attachment.

The meaning of all this is that when he is near his Teacher, he should
not permit the slightest movement of his organs, even towards such
things as are not prohibited.

‘*With joined palm*’—*i.e*., with the hands joined together in the shape
of a pigeon, turned upwards.—(192)
