‘*Superiors*’;—those possessed of greater amount of wealth and learning.
Towards these ‘*he should behave always as towards the
Teacher*’;—*i.e*., he should offer him obeisance, welcome and so forth.

In this verse many such words have been used as are superfluous; but in
as much as this is a metrical work, such usage is not objectionable.
‘Towards superiors’ was all that should h ave been said here; ‘as
towards the Teacher’ would be already implied; ‘*behaviour*’ has already
been mentioned in the preceding verse. Many such instances can be found
in this work.

‘*Towards the Teacher’s son who has acquired the position of the
Teacher*’;—the addition of the word ‘*ācārya*’ is meant to show that the
son should have obtained the position of the Teacher. The sense is that,
if during the Teacher’s absence, his son teaches his pupils for a few
days, he should be treated as a Teacher

Another reading is ‘*guruputresvaṭhāryeṣu*.’ The term ‘*ārya*’ in’this
case would mean ‘one belonging to the highly qualified Brāhmaṇa-caste,’
as we find in such instances as—‘śūdrāccāryo jyāyān.’

This verse does not enjoin that such treatment should lie accorded to
all the sons of the Teacher.

‘*Towards the Teacher’s own blood-relations*.’—The epithet ‘own’ has
been added for the purpose of restricting the statement to members of
the Teacher’s family; the mere fact of being a member of the Teacher’s
family is the sole ground for the treatment being accorded to
him,—irrespectively of age, learning, etc.—(207)

‘*Ācārye*’—is construed as qualifying ‘*guruputre*’ according to
Medhātithi, who explains the two terms as ‘the teacher’s son who imparts
instruction for a few days during the absence of the teacher’.—Another
reading, suggested by

Medhātithi is ‘*āryeṣu*’, explained as ‘duly qualified Brāhmaṇas’
(Medhātithi, Kullūka and Govindarāja);—‘virtuous’ (Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana);—‘older in age’ (Vīramitrodaya).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462), where we
have the following explanations:—‘*Śreyaḥsu*’ means ‘those possessed of
superior learning and other qualifications;—‘*āryeṣu*’ means ‘older in
age’;—‘*guroḥ svabandhuṣu*’ means ‘the teacher’s uncles and other
relations—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 34).

207	Towards his betters let him always behave as towards his teacher, likewise towards sons of his teacher, born by wives of equal caste, and towards the teacher's relatives both on the side of the father and of the mother.
