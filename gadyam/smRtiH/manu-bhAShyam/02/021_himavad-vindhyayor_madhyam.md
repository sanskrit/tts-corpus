On the north lies the Himālaya and on the south the Vindhya.
‘*Vinaśana*’ is the name of the place where the Sarasvatī river has
disappeared.—(20)

‘*Prayāga*’—is the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā.

The region having these four as its boundaries is to be known by the
name ‘*Madhya-deśa*.’ It is called ‘*madhya*’ or ‘middle,’ because it is
neither very superior nor very inferior,—and *not* because it is located
*the centre* of the Earth.—(21)

‘*Vināśana*’—This is the name given to the place where the river
Sarasvatī becomes lost in the sands. Buhler says it lies in the district
of Hissar, in the Punjab.

Buhler curiously translates ‘*pratyak*’ by ‘east,’ while it means
*west*.

This verse is quoted in the *Smṛticandrikā* (p. 18), which explains
‘*vinaśana*’ as the place where the Sarasvatī has disappeared;—in the
*Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣa, p. 56) which locates ‘Vinaśana’ in the
*Kurukṣetra*,—in the *Dānamayūkha*, (p. 7),—and the *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 4).
