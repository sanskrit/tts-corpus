न चैतन् मन्तव्यम्- "नियमितानि येन चिरम् इन्द्रियाणि, अतिगुरुपातकं गुरुदारेषु दुष्टेन भावेन प्रेक्षणम् अपीति य एवं वेद तस्य न दोषः पादस्पर्शादौ" इति । यत एवंविधान् अपि दोषान् यो जानीते, यो वा न किंचिज् जानीते, तौ स्त्रीविषये समानौ । यतो नात्र विद्वत्ता प्रभवति । शक्नुवन्ति स्त्रियः सर्वं **उत्पथम्**[^५३४] अमार्गं लोकशास्त्रविरुद्धं विषयं **नेतुं** प्रापयितुं **कामक्रोधवशानुगं** सन्तम् । कामक्रोधाभ्यां यः संबध्यत इत्य् अर्थः ।

It should not be thought that the person who has full control over his
organs and who is fully aware that even locking at the Teacher’s wife
with impure motives is a heinous offence, incurs no danger by touching
her feet. Because so far as women are concerned, the person cognisant of
the grievousness of the sin, as well as the person not so cognisant,
both are equal; for no amount of learning is any use in this matter;
women are capable of leading astray—on the wrong path, contrary to usage
and scriptures—all men.

‘*Who becomes a servile follower of desire and passion*,’—Who becomes
contaminated with desire and passion. This epithet only serves to
indicate a particular condition of man. Barring the too young and too
old, and one who has reached the highest stage of Yoga, there is no one,
with the exception of one who has entirely destroyed his human
susceptibilities, who is not attracted by women, just as iron is
attracted by the magnet. This is not due to any powerful influence
intentionally exercised; it is in the very nature of things that at the
sight of a young woman, the mind of man becomes upset, specially that of
young students.—(214)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 104) as laying
down the reason why the young wife of the Teacher should not be touched
in the feet by the young pupil, the meaning being—‘Because women are
capable of leading the learned as well as the ignorant man, who may
yield to to physical desires and other weaknesses’.

214	For women are able to lead astray in (this) world not only a fool, but even a learned man, and (to make) him a slave of desire and anger.
