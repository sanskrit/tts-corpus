There is no “day forbidden for study” in regard to the daily recitation; since this has been called “Brahmasatra”; it is meritorious, being offered with the offering of study, and being maintained by the syllable “vaṣaṭ” in the shape of the recitation made on forbidden days.—(106)

This verse supplies the valedictory supplement to the foregoing
Injunction.

For the following reason, ‘*in regard to the daily recitation, there is
no day forbidden for study*,’ because ‘*it has been called
Brahmasatra*.’ That is called ‘*Satra*’ which is performed continuously;
just as the *Satra* continues to be performed for thousand years and
more without a break—and the sacrifice consisting of Vedic Study also is
a *Satra*; and because it is a *Satra*, there should he no break in it;
for if there were a break, it would cease to be ‘*Satra*.’

That the Recitation is a *Satra* is further explained by means of a
metaphor. (1) This *Satra* is offered with the offering of
‘Brahman’—*i.e*., study; just as the ordinary *Satra* is offered with
the offering of Soma. The root ‘*hu*’ in this connection stands for
*unceasing offering*, verbal roots being capable of several
significations. The term \* *Brahma*’ indicates the act of study
pertaining to the Veda. The ‘study of Brahma’ is like an ‘offering’;
this compound (‘*Brahmā-huti*’) being in accordance with Pāṇini 2.1.50.

The recitation that is done on the forbidden days supplies the place of
the syllable ‘*v* *aṣaṭ*.’ In the ordinary *Satra*, at the end of each
Yājyā-hymn tho continuity is maintained by the uttering of the syllable
‘*vaṣat*’; and in the same manner, the continuity of ‘Vedic Study’ is
maintained by the recitation that is made on the *Caturdaśī* and other
forbidden days; and this recitation therefore takes the place of the
syllable ‘*vaṣaṭ*.’

The term ‘*vaṣat*’ here indicates the syllable ‘*vauṣaṭ*.’

The *Satra* is ‘*maintained*—*i.e*.’, accomplished—by this syllable. The
compound (‘*vaṣaṭkṛtam*’) being in accordance with Pāṇini 2.1.32.—(106)

“The last clause of verse 106 finds its explanation by the passage from,
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa quoted by Āpastamba, 1. 12. 3.”—Buhler.

Neither Buhler’s, nor Burnell’s, nor Hopkins’ rendering of the verse is
in keeping with the explanation provided by Medhātithi or Kullūka.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 282) along with 105, as
setting forth an exception to the rules regarding days unfit for
study;—in *Aparārka* (p. 137);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 775).

106	There are no forbidden days for the daily recitation, since that is declared to be a Brahmasattra (an everlasting sacrifice offered to Brahman); at that the Veda takes the place of the burnt oblations, and it is meritorious (even), when (natural phenomena, requiring) a cessation of the Veda-study, take the place of the exclamation Vashat.
