The wise man should put forth an effort to restrain his organs roaming among alluring objects; just as the driver restrains the horses.—(88)

All that the teaching means is that “one should strive to restrain his
organs”: the rest of the text is merely descriptive, up to the verse
where we have the injunction regarding the Twilight Prayers (101).

‘*Restrain*’—means the avoiding of addiction to prohibited objects and
the avoiding of excessive addiction to even those objects that are
permitted. That the prohibited tilings should be avoided we learn from
those prohibitions themselves: hence the present verse and the verses
that follow should be taken as laying down the avoiding of
over-addiction to even such things as are not prohibited.

This is what is meant by the expression—‘*roaming a many*
*objects*,’—*i.e*., in course of their natural functioning.

‘*Alluring*.’—Things that attract, draw to themselves, overpower, the
man, are called ‘alluring objects,’ those that captivate the mind.
*Roaming* among these means ‘functioning among them in manifold ways.’
If the organs did not operate among them, what could even the most
alluring objects do? Or, even if the organs were devoid of all
restraint, if the objects themselves were repellant, it would he a very
simple matter for the agent, to restrain himself. As a matter of fact,
however, both are at fault (the objects are alluring and the organs are
operative among them); hence it becomes necessary to put forth special
effort, the organs being hard to control.

‘*As the driver restrains the horses*.’—‘*Driver*’ is the *charioteer*.
Just as the charioteer puts forth special effort to coutrol the horses
that are naturally restive, and are prone to run wild along the wrong
way, and the horses become obedient to him,—in the same way one should
curb the organs to his own will.—(88)

This verse is quoted in *Bālambhaṭṭi* (Vyāvahāra, p. 606).

*Medhātithi* (p. 116, 11. 11-12)—*Pariśiṣṭorthavādaḥ
āṣandhyopāsanavidhiḥ*—*i.e*. upto verse 100, all this is mere Arthavāda.
But on p. 110, he says that verse 97 contains a *vidhi*.

It is interesting to note that what Medhātithi has called Arthavāda,
Hopkins calls ‘elaborate interpolation’ (note on verse 91).

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 3.9—‘One who behaves like this keeps the senses
under control attains the regions of Brahman.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 11.4.—‘Pure, with senses under control, equipped
with fully qualified-aids.’

*Kaṭha*-*Upaniṣad*, 3.6.—‘He who is equipped with knowledge, with mind
composed, has his senses under control; just as good horses are under
ṭhe control of the charioteer.’

*Bhagavadgītā*, 2.67-68.—‘When the mind follows in the wake of the
roaming sense-organs, it deprives him of his wisdom; just as the storm
destroys the boat in water. Therefore that man whose sense-organs have
been withdrawn from the objects of sense, has his wisdom firmly
established.’
