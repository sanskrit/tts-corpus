**कामम्** इत्य् अरुचिं सूचयति । उत्तरेण चैतत् संबध्यते "विप्रोष्य पादग्रहणम्" (म्ध् २.२१७) इति । **भुवि** तु पादवन्दनम् इष्यत एव । **युवतीनां युवा** द्वयोर् यूनोर् अयं विधिः । यदि बालो ब्रह्मचारी वृद्धा वा गुरुपत्नी तदा पादोपसंग्रहणम् अविरुद्धम् । **असाव् अहम् इति** प्राग् उक्तस्य विधेर् अनुवादः । **विधिवद्** इति व्यस्तपाणिना ॥ २.२१६ ॥

‘*May*’ signifies dis-satisfaction on the part of the author; or, it may
bo construed with the next verse.

‘*On the ground*’—the clasping of the feet is not necessarily meant to
be done.

‘*The young man..... to the young wives*’;—*i.e*., what is here laid
down pertains to cases where both parties are young. If the student is a
child, or the Teacher’s wife is old, then the clasping of the feet is
unobjectionable.

‘*Here I am*’;—this refers to the rule prescribed before (in 123).

‘*Proper*’—*i.e*., with upturned hands, etc. (see 72).—(216)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 30l), as laying
down how, in view of the foregoing text, the young student is to behave
towards the Teacher’s wife;—also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462),
which remarks that the term ‘*yuvā*’, ‘young man,’ in this verse makes
it clear that the mention of ‘twenty years’ in verse 212 is meant to
stand for youth in general;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 47) as laying down
the necessity of saluting the Teacher’s wives;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 104).
