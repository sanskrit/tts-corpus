‘*Attachment*’ means *addiction*; ‘*by*’ this, as the means, one
‘*incurs*’—attains—‘*evil*,’ \[visible\] as well as invisible. There is
no doubt in this; it is absolutely certain.

‘*By subjugating these*’—organs—one subsequently ‘*attains
success*,’—the attainment of the desired end; *i.e*., he acquires in its
entirety all the fruits of the performance of acts enjoined in *Śruti*
and in *Smṛti*.—(93)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Doṣam*’—‘Guilt’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘evil, visible and invisible’—(Medhātithi
and Kullūka) *i.e*. misery and sin;—‘evil, in the shape of rebirths’
(Rāghavānanda).

‘*Siddhim*’—‘Success, in the form of the rewards of all acts’
(Medhātithi);—‘final release’ (Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda);—‘all human
ends, Final Release and all the rest’ (Govindarāja and Kullūka).

**(Verses 93-95)  
**

*Dakṣa-smṛti* (7. 12 and 16).—‘He whose mind is addicted to objects
never attains Yoga; therefore the Yogin should make an effort to avoid
addiction to objects.’

*Vaśiṣṭha-smṛti* (30.10-11).—‘As one grows old, his hairs fade fade also
his teeth; but longing for life and longing for wealth never fade, even
while the man is fading away. That which cannot be avoided by
foolish-minded persons, that which does not fade even while the man is
fading away, that which is a mortal disease,—such Desire when one
renounces, then alone does he attain happiness.’

093	Through the attachment of his organs (to sensual pleasure) a man doubtlessly will incur guilt; but if he keep them under complete control, he will obtain success (in gaining all his aims).
