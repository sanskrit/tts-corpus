Having met a Brāhmaṇa, one should ask him his “welfare,” a Kṣatriya his “freedom from distemper,” a Vaiśya his “prosperity,” and a Shudra his “freedom from disease.”—(127)

When a greeting has been offered and answered, and friendly relations
have thereby become established, occasion arises for enquiry; and the
present verse lays down the verbal forms whose diversity is based upon
distinctions of caste; and the caste-distinction pertains to the persons
questioned, not to the questioner. And, in as much as there is not very
much of a difference in the meaning of the words laid down, the
restriction is with reference to the verbal forms only. For instance,
the terms ‘*anāmaya*,’ ‘freedom from distemper,’ and ‘*ārogya*,’
‘freedom from disease,’ mean the same thing; nor is there much
difference in the meanings of the terms ‘*kuśala*,’ ‘welfare’ and
‘*kṣema*,’ ‘prosperity.’ Though the term ‘*kuśala*’ denotes
*erpertness*, yet it is also used in the sense of the *non-deficiency of
the body* and other things related to it.

The words here laid down must be used; but this does not mean that the
man should not make use of other words also, if he wishes to make
detailed enquiries; as has been clearly shown somewhere in the

On the strength of the expression ‘*having*,’ some people explain this
verse to mean tbat the questions are to be put only to persons of equal
age, and they do not apply to the case of the teacher and other
superiors; for the teacher has to be ‘*approached*,’ not ‘*met*.’

But, as a matter of fact, there is ‘meeting’ in ‘approaching’ also; so
there is no force in the said explanation.—(127)

According to Govindarāja, the rule refers to friends or relatives
meeting, not to every one who returns a salute.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 450) in support of
the view that the term ‘*vipraḥ*’ in verse 125 includes the Kṣatriya,
the Vaiśya and the Śūdra also; as it lays down the return-greeting for
all these;—and again on page 465, as a verse common to Manu and Yama and
laying down the benedictory response to salutation.

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 298) as laying down
the return-greetings appropriate for the several castes;—in
*Nityāchārapradīpa* (p. 406) as laying down what should be said after
salutation has been returned;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 47);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 100).

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 298).—‘The response to the Brāhmaṇa shall he
*svasti*; to the Kṣatriya, *āyuṣmān*; to the Vaiśya, *dhanavān*; to the
Śūdra, *freedom* from disease.’
