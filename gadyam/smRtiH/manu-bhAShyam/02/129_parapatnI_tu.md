<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When conversation is held with a female in connection with some
business, then one should do as directed in this verse.

She who is the wife of another person should be addressed either as
‘blessed lady,’ or as ‘lady, my sister.’ The term ‘*bhavati*’ ending in
the short vowel is derived from the base ‘*bhavat*’ with the feminine
affix, and with the vocative Case-ending. The particle ‘*iṭi*’ after
‘*bhavati*’ indicates that it is used in addition to the terms ‘blessed’
and ‘sister.’

‘*One should address*’;—this conclusively proves that the terms in
question arc meant to he used in their verbal forms.

If the lady happens to he an elderly one, she should he addressed as
‘mother,’ ‘glorious one’ and so forth; and if she is younger in age, she
is to be addressed as ‘daughter,’ ‘long-lived one,’ and so forth.

The presence of the term ‘wife’ shows that the form laid down is not to
be used in connection with unmarried girls.

‘*Who is not related to one by birth*,’—one who, like the daughter of
the maternal uncle, has not become a ‘relative’ either from the father’s
or the mother’s side. Special rules regarding these are going to be laid
down below (under 132).

*Objection*.—“In that case this latter verse would suffice to signify
that the present rule does not apply to relatives; and the general rule
here laid down would he applicable to other cases; under the
circumstances, where is the use of adding the clause ‘who is not
related, etc.’?”

*Answer*.—This being a metrical treatise, we should not be very
particular about superfluous repetitions.—(129)
