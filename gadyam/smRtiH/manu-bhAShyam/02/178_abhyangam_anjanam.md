‘*Anointing*’—rubbing of the head and body with butter, oil or such
other oily substances.

‘*Applying collyrium to the eyes*—the addition of the word ‘eyes’ is
only for the purpose of filling up the metre.

What is prohibited in regard to these two is the having recourse to them
by way of ornamentation; and not their use as medicine. That this is so
is. dear from their being mentioned along with ‘scents and garlands.’

‘*Shoes*’—foot-covers *made of leather*; not all kinds of foot-cover.

‘*Holding of the umbrella*’—either by one’s own hand or by the hand of
another person; both are prohibited.

‘*Kāma*’ here stands for *attachment*; the preclusion of *sexual desire*
being already included under the prohibition of association with women
(in 177).

‘*Anger*’—rage.

‘*Avarice*’—selfishness. Notions of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ are the
characteristics of the mind.

‘*Dancing*.’—The throwing about of one’s limbs for the delectation of
ordinary people, as also the acting of dramas according to the rules
laid down by Bharata and others.

‘*Singing*’—the exhibition of the ‘Ṣaḍja’ and other musical notes.

‘*Playing upon musical instruments,'*—the producing of musical sounds by
means of the lute, the flute and so forth, as also the striking, to
time, of such instruments as the drum, *mṛdaṅga* and the like.—(178)
