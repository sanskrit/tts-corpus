The brother’s wife, if of the same caste, should be clasped in the feet day by day; but the wives of other paternal, maternal and other relatives should be so clasped only when one has gone on a journey.—(132)

‘*Brother’s*’—should be understood to mean ‘of the elder brother.’

‘*Should be clasped in the feel*,’—should be saluted on their feet.

‘*Of the same caste*’—belonging to the same caste as her husband. As for
the brother’s wires who belong to the *Kṣatriya* and other castes, they
are to be treated as ordinary relatives.

‘*The wives of other paternal and maternal relatives*—*only when one has
gone on a journey*’;—*i.e*., by one who has *returned* from a journey;
for no clasping of the feet could be done by one who is away on a
journey.

‘*Jñāti*’ stands for paternal relatives;—‘*Sambandhi*’ for maternal
relatives; as also other relatives, such as the father-in-law and the
rest. The wives of these—when they are of older age; this is clear from
the fact that ‘the clasping of the feet’ is a form of worship which
cannot be right in the case of relatives of younger age.—(132)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 458) in support of
the view that the clasping of the feet of the brother’s wife should be
done when one belongs to the same caste as her husband; and the
prohibition of such clasping met with in some Smṛtis should be taken as
referring to cases where the sister-in-law happens to belong to a lower
caste;—also in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra p. 103).

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra* (6.8).—‘Of the brother’s wife and the
mother-in-law, there should be no clasping of the feet.’

132	(The feet of the) wife of one's brother, if she be of the same caste (varna), must be clasped every day; but (the feet of) wives of (other) paternal and maternal relatives need only be embraced on one's return from a journey.
