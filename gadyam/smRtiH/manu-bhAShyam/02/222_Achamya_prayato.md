In as much as there is great sin accruing from sleeping at sun-set and
sun-rise,—therefore ‘*having sipped water*—‘*with mind calm*’—intent
upon the purpose—‘*and collected*’—having set aside all
distractions;—‘*in a dean place, reciting the mantras to be
recited*,’—*i.e*., the *Praṇava*, the *Vyāhṛtis* and the
*Sāvitrī*;—‘*one should attend upon the two twilights*.’ The two
twilights are the objects to be attended upon; and ‘attendance’ in this
case can only be in the form of a particular disposition of the mind.

Or, the construction may be—‘*During the two twilights he shall attend
upon*—the Sun.’ Since the mantra (Sāvitrī) is one sacred to the Sun, it
is the Sun that should be the object of attendance; *i.e*., having given
up all distraction, he should fix his mind upon the Sun.

The rest of the verse is a descriptive commendation of the foregoing
injunction; the *attending* alone being the object of the injunction.

Others explain that the verse is meant to be the injunction of the
‘*clean place*.’

But in this case there would be a needless repetition. In connection
with all acts it has been laid down that ‘it should be done by one who
is clean’; and if one were to sit in an unclean place, how could he be
regarded as ‘clean’?—(222)

*Viṣṇu* (28.2).—‘Offering of the two Twilight Prayers.’

*Gautama* (2-17).—‘The Morning Prayer should be offered standing, the
Evening one, seated; the former while stars are visible, the latter
before the stars have become visible.’
