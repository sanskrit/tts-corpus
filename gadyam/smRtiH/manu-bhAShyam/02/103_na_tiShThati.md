But he who does not stand during the morning-twilight, and who does not sit through the evening-twilight, should be excluded, like the Sśūdra, from all that is due to twice-born persons.—(103)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The present verse, describing the evil accruing from the non-performance
of the Twilight-Prayers, serves to emphasise the compulsory character of
these.

He who does not keep standing during the morning-twilight and who does
not keep seated during the evening-twilight, should be regarded as a
*Śūdra*.

‘*From all that is due to twice-born persons*’;—*i.e*., entertaining as
a guest, honouring, offering of gifts and so forth.—‘*He should be
excluded*,’—*i.e*., discarded.

For this reason, in order to avoid being treated as a *Śūdra* one should
observe the Twilight Prayers every day.

This verse also points out the motive behind the performance; and
*standing* and *seating* during the repeating of the *Sāvitrī* are the
acts enjoined in the present context; and that act is to be regarded as
of primary importance with which the motive happens to be connected; so
that all the rest of what is said in the present connection is only
subsidiary and of secondary importance.—(103)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Ācāra, p. 258),—where
‘*Dvijakarma*’ is explained as *studying* and the *rest*,—as precluding
the neglector of Twilight Prayers from all Brahmanical functions.

*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra* (2.4.15).—‘Here are two verses recited by
Prajāpati—One who does not worship the Morning Twilight before its
advent, and who does not worship the Evening Twilight before its
lapse,—how can they be regarded as Brāhmaṇa? Those Brāhmaṇas who worship
not the Morning and Evening Twilights, them the righteous king would be
free to employ in the works of Śūdras.’

*Dakṣa (Parāśaramādhava*, p. 268).—‘The man devoid of the Twilight
Prayers is unclean and unfit for all rites.’

*Gobhila* (*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 278).—‘One who knows not, and observes
not the Twilight Prayers,—while living—he remains a Śūdra, and on death
becomes born as a dog.’

*Viṣṇu-purāṇa* (*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 278).—‘Those who observe not the
Morning or Evening Prayers, those evil-minded ones fall into the darkest
hell.’

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 379).—‘If one neglects the Twilight
Prayers, and devotes his attention to other acts, he falls into ten
thousand hells.’

*Yājñavalkya* (*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 379).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa, except when
he is ill, omits the Twilight Prayers, he incurs sin and is despised in
the world.’

*Atri* (*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 379).—‘Those who, while in good health,
observe not the Twilight Prayers,—are wicked and injure the sun.’

103	But he who does not (worship) standing in the morning, nor sitting in the evening, shall be excluded, just like a Sudra, from all the duties and rights of an Aryan.
