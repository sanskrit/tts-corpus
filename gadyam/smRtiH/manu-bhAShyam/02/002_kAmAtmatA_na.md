It is not right to be absorbed in desires—“But there is in this world, no absolute absence of desire; for the study of the Vedas itself is prompted by desire, as also every act prescribed in the Veda.”—(2)


“But there is in this world, no absolute absence of desires; that is, as a matter of fact, in this world, there is no activity for one who is entirely without desire. To say nothing of such acts as cultivation of land, trade and the like, which are done by men of experience,—even the ‘study of the Veda,’ the learning of the Veda, which the boy is made to do by his father and others, being even chastised by them, even this is not possible without some desire; reading consists in the uttering of words; and utterance never proceeds, like the sound of thunder, without desire.—‘Well, if the Boy desires to read, why is he beaten?’—It is by beating that his desire is aroused; the only difference is that in connection with things that the person likes, the desire arises of itself (and does not need an incentive in the shape of the beating).—Similarly ‘the acts prescribed in the Veda,’—as compulsory in connection with the Darśapūrṇa nāṣa and other sacrifices are not possible without desire. There is no possibility of a man giving away to Deities things that belong to himself, unless there is a desire in him for doing so. Hence the prohibition of ‘absorption in desires’ becomes an interdict upon all acts prescribed in the Veda and iu the Smṛtis.”—(3)

The man for whom desire for reward forms the sole motive to act is said
to be ‘*absorbed in desires*’; and it is this character that is
expressed by the abstract noun; the term ‘*ātman*’ in this compound
denoting *preponderance*.

‘*It is not right?*,’—*i.e*., it is deprecated.

\[An objection is raised\]—“This deprecation leads us to infer that the
said *absorption in desires* is prohibited.—This means that the text
contains the prohibition of all such sacrifices as the *Saurya* and the
like, which are performed with a desire for a definite reward. Or, why
should we specify the *Saurya* and other sacrifices? All performance of
actions is for the accomplishment of a desirable end; no one acts simply
for the accomplishing of the act itself; in fact there is no action
without results. As for the assertion (contained in 4.63) that ‘one
should not act aimlessly’ \[which might be taken to imply that there are
*aimless* actions, such as\] pouring libations on extinguished fire, or
seeking for information regarding what is happening to kings and places
of other countries,—in reality, in these cases also there is some result
following from the act; and all that is meant by calling them ‘aimless’
is that they do not bring about any important results, in the shape of
attainment of Heaven, acquisition of village-property and so forth,
which are useful to men in the invisible and visible spheres. It might
be argued that—‘It may be that the action brings about a reward; what is
meant is that the man should have no desire for that reward; even
though, in the very nature of things, the reward will follow.’ Even so
the *Saurya* and other sacrifices would be without rewards; that alone
is regarded as ‘reward’ which is actually *desired*; so that there could
be no ‘reward’ for one who has no desires. In the ordinary world, we do
not find any such activity as is absolutely independent of a desire for
reward. Nor have we any such Vedic declaration as that ‘in connection
with Vedic actions alone there should be no desire for reward.’ On the
contrary, all Vedic acts have been prescribed as bringing definite
rewards; so that if desire for rewards is interdicted, it would mean
that the acts would not be done; and this would militate against the
spirit of the Vedas. As regards the compulsory acts (prescribed in the
Veda), there is no possibility of rewards in their case. Then again,
since the prohibition in the text is a general one (and not restricted
to Vedic acts only), it would lead to the cessation of all ordinary
activity of the world, and would thus run counter to visible practice
also, and it comes to this that no one should do anything, all should
sit silent.”

To the above objection we make the following reply:—

\(1\) It has been argued that the Text implies the prohibition of the
*Saurya* and such other sacrifices, which are admittedly prompted by
desire for rewards; as regards this, the author is himself going to say
(in Verso 5) that ‘the man fulfils the desires he may have entertained’;
if he had meant to prohibit (by the present verse) such acts, how could
there be any ‘entertainment’ or ‘fulfilment’ of desires?

\(2\) The second point urged is that, since the text does not specify
Vedic acts alone, the interdict would apply to ordinary actions also.
But the required specification has already been made by the text (in the
preceding verse), where it says—‘Learn that Dharma’; which shows that it
is *Dharma* (and not the ordinary activity of the world) that forms the
subject-matter of the present discourse.

\(3\) The third point raised is that—“in as much as no rewards are
mentioned in connection with the compulsory acts, there can be no
possibility of any desire for rewards in the case of these; so that no
useful purpose could be served by the prohibiting of such desires.”—

Now in answer to this we make the following observations:—

(*a*) By reason of no rewards being spoken of, no one would ever
undertake the performance of any compulsory act, unless he were a person
thoroughly conversant with the scriptures (and hence realising the
importance of compulsory duties):

and (*b*) in the case of the *Saurya* and such other acts as have
rewards mentioned in connection with them, finding that men are prompted
to their performance by desire for those rewards, people might be led to
the generalisation that whatever one is to do should be done with the
desire for a definite reward; and thus come to undertake the performance
of the compulsory acts also only through a desire for reward, oven
though no such reward has been spoken of in the scriptures.

And it is with a view to preclude these possibilities that the text lays
down the interdict. Though the general rule is that—

(*a*) an act which is mentioned as leading to a definite result can only
be performed with a view to that result,

(*b*) while that which is laid down in the scriptures as not bringing
any reward, and in connection with which one cannot assume a reward
according to the principle enunciated in relation to the *Viśvajit*
-sacrifice \[*Pūrvamīmāmsā-Sūtra*, 4.3. 15-16; that where no reward is
mentioned, the attainment of heaven should be regarded as the reward\],
can never be performed otherwise (than in the purely disinterested
manner),—yet there may be persons who are conversant with this
principle; and it is to these persons that the text addresses the
exhortation; specially as it would be rather difficult to carry
conviction to such persons by mere reasoning; and the requisite
knowledge is conveyed in a simpler and easier manner by means of direct
advice.

It is for this reason that the author has, in a friendly spirit,
conveyed a teaching which is thoroughly established by proofs.

Though the word ‘*Kama*’ is generally found to be used in the sense of
*sexual desire*, yet, since in the present context that sense is not
applicable, it has to be taken as synonymous with ‘*icchā*’ (Desire) and
‘*abhilāṣa*,’ (Longing). So that in view of what follows, the meaning of
the text comes to be that ‘one should not undertake the performance of
all acts simply with a desire for reward.’

The opponent, taking the ‘*absorption in desires*’ to mean mere
*presence of desire in general*, urges the following objection:—

> “*But there is in this world, no absolute absence of desires*; that
> is, as a matter of fact, in this world, there is no activity for one
> who is entirely without desire. To say nothing of such acts as
> cultivation of land, trade and the like, which are done by men of
> experience,—even the ‘study of the Veda,’ the learning of the Veda,
> which the boy is made to do by his father and others, being even
> chastised by them, even this is not possible without some desire;
> *reading* consists in the uttering of words; and utterance never
> proceeds, like the sound of thunder, without desire.—‘Well, if the Boy
> *desires* to read, why is he beaten?’—It is by beating that his desire
> is aroused; the only difference is that in connection with things that

> Hence the prohibition of ‘absorption in desires’ becomes an interdict

Much ingenuity has again been displayed to show that verses 2—5 are a
‘later interpolation.’ Burnell remarks that it must be so, because ‘in
the old Vedic religion, all ceremonies and sacrifices were avowedly
performed in order to gain desired objects of various kinds.’ He
evidently forgot that what is expounded by Manu is not exactly what the
writer speaks of as ‘the old Vedic religion.’

‘*Na praśastā*’—Because leading to new births, and obstructing Final
Release.

*Ibid*, 1.21-5.—‘Having fully comprehended the nature of acts, one
should undertake that which he likes.’
