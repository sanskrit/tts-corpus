So far we had the section dealing with the Initiatory Ceremony. All that
has been said here pertains to that ceremony.

“Well, if so, then the *Keśānta* (spoken of in 65) would also pertain to
the Initiation.”

Not so, as that sacrament has been laid down as to be performed at its
own time, which comes long after the

Initiatory Ceremony has been finished. So that, even though it is
mentioned in the same context, it becomes connected with other rites by
virtue of the force of syntactical connection. Thus it is that some
people regard the *Keśānta* as to be done after the Final Bath (to say
nothing of the Initiation).

The term ‘*aupanāyanika*’ means *pertaining to the* *Upa* *nayana*, the
initial vowel being prolonged, as in other cases explained before.

‘*Birth*’—being born from their parents; this is what is
‘*marked*’—manifested, perfected—by the said ceremony; even though born,
the boy, before Initiation, is as good as not born; as till then he is
not entitled to any religious acts. Hence the ceremony is what ‘marks’
his birth.

‘*Sanctifies*’—this has been already explained.

The duties with which the initiated boy becomes connected—to which he
becomes entitled,—those that should be performed by the initiated
bov—all these are going to be expounded;—these ‘*now learn*’—(68)

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra*, 1.26.9-17.—‘Those who are not Śūdras, whose
acts are not defective, for them, Upanayana, Vedic study, Fire-laying
are all effective;—the Upanayana is a Vedic sacrament for purposes of
study: it is the best *birth*.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 1.10.—‘The Upanayana is the second birth for the
Brāhmaṇa.’
