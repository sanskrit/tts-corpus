When the wind comes from the side on which the Teacher is sitting to
where the pupil sits,—and when it comes from where the pupil sits to
when the Teacher is,—these are called ‘*lee-ward*’ and ‘*wind-ward*’;
one being ‘lee-ward’ and the other ‘wind-ward.’ In either of these
fashions one should not sit in the Teacher’s company; be should sit in
such a fashion that he gets the wind sideways.

‘*Beyond his hearing*’;—*i.e*., wbat he cannot hear.

‘*Nothing*,’—with reference either to the Teacher or to other persons.

‘*He should say*’—nothing, what the Teacher cannot hear, but can see
from the moving of the lips that the pupil is saying something.—(203)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 461), where
‘*prativāte*’ is explained as ‘that place to which wind reaches from the
place where the Teacher is sitting’;—*Anuvāte*’ as ‘that place from
where wind blows towards the Teacher’;—at neither of these places should
the Student sit;—‘*Asaṃśrava*’ is that place from where anything spoken
is not heard by the Teacher,—sitting in such a place, he should not say
anything addressed to the Teacher.

This verse is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 107), where the
following notes are added:—‘*Prativāta*’ is ‘wind that blows from the
teacher towards the pupil’; at such a place the Student shall not sit;
as there is the danger of the fire of the teacher’s anger issuing forth
that way;—‘*Anuvāta*’ is wind blowing from the pupil towards the
teacher; there also he shall not sit; as he is likely not to hear the
words of the teacher;—‘*asambhave*’ means *unless permitted by him*.
