The present verse is a valedictory description of the origin of the
*Gāyatrī* -verse beginning with the words ‘*tat savitur vareṇyam*,’
which serves the purpose of introducing the coming injunction. As for
the injunction of the *Vyāhṛtis*, this is to be deduced from the
valedictory description contained in the preceding verse. As for the
actual order in which the several syllables have to be pronounced, that
is ascertained from the order in which they are found mentioned in tho
text. The author is also going to lay down in the next verse—‘They
should pronounce this syllable (om), and this verse (‘*tat* *savitur*,
etc.’), preceded by the *Vyāhṛtis*.’

‘*Milked*’—churned out.

“*Beginning with ‘tat*’;”—though this being all that the text says, it
might refer to an altogether different verse—‘*tat savitur vṛṇimahe*,
etc.’ (Ṛgveda, 5. 82. 1), which is not three-footed,—yet it is the
three-footed verse that should he taken as referred to here; and it is
the ‘*Sāvitrī*’ verse that is *three-footed*.

In as much as *Kaśyapa* and other sagos are also called ‘*Prajāpati*,’
the text has added the qualification ‘*Supreme*’; so that it is
Hiraṇyagarbha that becomes specified; as it is He who *dwells on, the
highest* *spot*, from where there is no reversion (to worldliness).

This has been added with a view to show the extreme importance of the
*Sāvitrī* verse;—it was churned by the highest of all Prajāpatis, out of
the Vedas.—(77)

Hopkins—“This verse is one of the most famous in literature, Whitney has
discussed it in Vol. I., pp. 111-112 of the new edition of Colebrook’s
Essays. His translation runs as follows—‘Of Savitar, the heavenly, that
longed-for glory may we win, and may himself inspire our prayers.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 52), as
supporting the view that the *gāyatrīmantra*, is ‘born of the Veda’ *par
excellence-*,—also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 338).

077	Moreover from the three Vedas Pragapati, who dwells in the highest heaven (Parameshthin), milked out (as it were) that Rik-verse, sacred to Savitri (Savitri), which begins with the word tad, one foot from each.
