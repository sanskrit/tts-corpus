If a person, who is not his regular pupil, but is reading near him,
should murder the text, or omit certain letters, or read with a wrong
accent,—the learned man should not, unless he is asked to (correct),
instruct the student and tell him ‘you have murdered the text, you
should read it thus.’ If the reader happen to he his own pupil, then he
should instruct him, even without being asked. If again the student were
to ask, but ask in an improper manner,—then also he should not instruct
him. The ‘proper manner’ of asking is to ask with due humility, in the
manner of a pupil, with such words as—‘in this matter I have a doubt,
pray instruct me on this point.’ In cases other than this, ‘*even though
knowing the* *truth*, *the wise man should behave*’—continue to
live—among men, ‘*as if ignorant*,’—as if he were dumb; *i.e*., he
should remain silent, as if he did not know anything.

This prohibition regarding the explaining of doubts without being asked
refers to scriptural matters; as regards temporal matters, the author is
going to declare that—‘Employed or not employed (by the king) the man
knowing the law should expound it.’ Others have held that the
prohibition contained in the present verse applies equally to both
scriptural and temporal matters.—(110)

‘*Jaḍavat*.’—‘*Jaḍa*’ is ‘dumb’ here (Medhātithi and Kullūka);—an
‘idiot’ (according to others).

This verse is quoted in *Yatidharmasaṃgraha* (p. 107).

*Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti* (2.18).—‘The Veda should not be taught to one who is
not prepared to render such respect as lies within his power.’

*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra* (2.50).—‘If a question regarding the Veda is
asked without due respect, it destroys the questioner, as fire burns
straw; therefore the Veda should not be expounded to those who do not
render proper respect.’

110	Unless one be asked, one must not explain (anything) to anybody, nor (must one answer) a person who asks improperly; let a wise man, though he knows (the answer), behave among men as (if he were) an idiot.
