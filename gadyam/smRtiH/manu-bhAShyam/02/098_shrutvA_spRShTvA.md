‘*Having heard*,’—such things as the sound of the flute, singing, etc.,
or such flattering words as ‘you are Bṛhaspati himself,’—‘*does not
rejoice*.’

‘*Does not grieve*’—does not suffer mental sorrow; ‘*grief*’ means
sorrow.

‘*Having touched*’;—such things as garments made of the hair of the
*Raṅku* deer, or of silk, or of the wool of sheep and goats, he touches
with equal feelings. Similarly he has exactly the same feelings in
regard to the sight of beautiful young women or of enemies; he eats with
equal feelings food cooked with plenty of butter and milk, as well as
coarse *rava* grains; he has the same feelings when smelling such things
as the oil of *Devadāru* and the oil of camphor, etc.

The man should behave so that he is not touched by mental joy or sorrow;
it is thus that his organs become subjugated; and not by mere
inactivity. So that restraint should be practised up to the said
point.—(98)

*Objection*—“Contact with women alone having been prohibited for the
Religions Student, why should the taking of nicely cooked food received
in alms be prohibited for him?”

In answer to this we have this next verse:—

*Śaṅkha-smṛti* (7. 8-9).—‘One should never mind it—whether his body is
smeared with sandal-paste, or ripped by an axe, or he attains prosperity
or adversity. Equally friendly towards all beings, looking equally upon
gold and Upon a clod of earth, fixed in contemplative meditation, the
Brāhmaṇa attains the highest state.’

*Viṣṇu-smṛti* (96. 23).—‘While one arm is being ripped with an axe and
another is being smeared with sandal-paint,—and while, on the one hand,
he meets with prosperity, and on the other, with adversity,—he should
not mind either.’

*Bhagavadgītā* (2. 57).—‘He who has no attachment to, anything, and on
meeting with happiness, neither rejoices nbr‘is grieved, his wisdom is
firm.’

*Bhagavadgītā* (5. 20).—‘One should not rejoice on coming by happiness;
nor should he become ruffled on coming by unhappiness; he whose mind is
firm, never deluded, he knows Brahman, and rests in Brahman.’
