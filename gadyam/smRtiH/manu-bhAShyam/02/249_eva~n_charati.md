‘*Thus*’ refers to the methods of the Lifelong Student.

‘*He who thus keeps his Studentship unflinchingly*’—without
failing,—‘*goes to*’—obtains—‘*the highest place*’—above; *i.e*., he
attains the Supreme Self.

‘*Is not born again into this world*—he does not fall into the cycle of
births. That is, he becomes absorbed into Brahman.—(249)
