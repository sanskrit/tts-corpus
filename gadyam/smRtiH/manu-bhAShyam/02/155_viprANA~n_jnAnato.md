Among Brāhmaṇas seniority is by knowledge; among Kṣatriyas by valour; and among Vaiśyas by grains and riches; among Shudras alone it is by age.—(155)

This also is a purely commendatory description.

It has been asserted above that *knowledge* singly is superior to wealth
and other things taken together; and the same idea is re-iterated in
greater detail, in this verse.

‘*Among Brāhmaṇas*, *seniority is by knowledge*’—not by wealth, etc.

‘*Among Kṣatriyas by valour*’;—‘*va* *lour*’ stands for the ‘efficiency’
of a substance and also for ‘firmness of strength.’

‘*Among Vaiśyas by grains and riches*’;—‘*grains*’ being mentioned
separately, the term ‘*riches*’ is to be taken as signifying *gold*,
etc.; just as in the expression ‘*brāhamaṇa-pariv* *rājaka*.’ \[Where
the Brāhmaṇa being mentioned separately, the term ‘*parivrājaka*’ is
taken as standing for the renunciate of other castes.\]

The Vaiśya possessing a large quantity of wealth is regarded as senior.

The affiix ‘*tasi*’ (in the words ‘*jñānataḥ*,’ etc.) denotes cause, and
is used in accordance with Pāṇini 2.3.23.—(155)

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta II* (p. 233);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 32);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 480).

*Medhātithi* (P. 145,1.16)—‘*Brāhmaṇaparivrājakavat*’—This maxim is
generally cited in cases where an object whose character has become
modified is spoken of by a name connotative of its former condition. For
instance, when a Brāhmaṇa has become a ‘wandering mendicant’, he is
called ‘Brāhmaṇa-mendicant’, in consideration of his past
*Brahmaṇahood*. In the present context however the maxim is used in the
sense that where one uses the term ‘*Brāhmaṇaparivrājaka*’, the Brāhmaṇa
being already spoken of by name, the term

155	The seniority of Brahmanas is from (sacred) knowledge, that of Kshatriyas from valour, that of Vaisyas from wealth in grain (and other goods), but that of Sudras alone from age.
