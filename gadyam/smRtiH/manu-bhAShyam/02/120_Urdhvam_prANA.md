<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse is commendatory to what has gone before.

‘*On the elder*’—the person of higher *age*—‘*approaching*’—coming
up,—‘*the vital breaths*’—the sources of life, the inner airs—‘*of the
younger*’—‘*rush outward*’—move out; *i.e*., giving up their functions,
they intend to cut off his life.

When however he rises to meek him and salutes him, the breaths proceed,
as before, to sustain his life.

‘*Recovers*’—becomes resuscitated.—(120)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 460);—again in the
same work (Ācāra, p. 150), where ‘*Āyāti*’ is explained as
‘*āyocchati*’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 97), as laying down
that before saluting one should rise.

*Vaśiṣṭha-smṛti* (13.13).—‘The Priest, the Father-in-law, the paternal
uncle, the maternal uncle—those not junior in age;—these he shall salute
after standing to receive them.’ *Āpastamba*, (Parāśaramādhava, p.
297)—\[reproduces Manu\].

*Mahābhārata* (13.104.64-65).—(same as Manu).

120	For the vital airs of a young man mount upwards to leave his body when an elder approaches; but by rising to meet him and saluting he recovers them.
