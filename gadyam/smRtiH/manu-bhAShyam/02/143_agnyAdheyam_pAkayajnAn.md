The rite that brings about the existence of the *Āhavanīya* and other
(sacrificial fires) is called the ‘Fire-laving Rite,’ prescribed in such
sentences as ‘the Brāhmaṇa should lay fire during the spring.’

‘*Cooked sacrifices*’—the *Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa* and the rest.

‘*The Agniṣṭoma and other sacrifices*,’—*i.e*., the Soma-sacrifices. The
term ‘*makha*’ is synonymous with ‘*kratu*,’ ‘*sacrifice*.’

He who perfoms these acts for one is called his ‘*priest*.’ ‘*For him*’
and ‘*his*’ denote relation; the meaning being that ‘the performer is
the officiating priest of only that man for whom he performs the acts,
and not of any other person.’

All these terms, ‘Preceptor’ and the rest, are words denoting relation.

‘*Being appointed*’—being requested; *i.e*., whose appointment has been
made in accordance with the rules laid down in the scriptures.

The ‘Priest’ has been described here, in connection with the mention of
persons entitled to respect; and priests have nothing to do with the
duties of the religious student. This description is supplied here only
for the purpose of indicating that the Priest also is entitled, like the
Preceptor and the rest, to respect.—(143)

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (H, p. 5) as supporting the
view that the title ‘*Ṛtvik*’ is applicable to the man from the moment
of ‘appointment’ till the end of the performance of the rites for which
he has been appointed; and that during this time any impurity attaching
to the man would be only ‘immediate’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 91) as defining the *Ṛtvik'*

It is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 477) where
‘*agnyādhāyam*’ is explained as *agnyādhānam*, and ‘*Pākayajña'* as *the
Aṣṭaka and the rest*;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 31);—and in *Aparārka* (p.
66) as meaning that the title ‘Ṛtvik’ applies to that man whose services
are paid for by a sacrificer for the performance of the sacrificial
rite;—and again on p. 919.

*Yājñavalkya*, 1.34.—‘He who performs, for one, sacrifices, is called
the *Ṛtvik*.’

*Viṣṇu-smṛti*, 3.3.—‘He who performs, for one, the sacrificial rites,
him he should know as the *Ṛtvik*.’

*Hārīta* (Aparārka, p. 66).—‘The Ṛtvik is of three kinds called—(1) the
*Kṣirahotā*, *i.e*., one who helps one, in the Firelaying, (2) the
*Ahāryavṛtā, i.e*., one who, in the absence of the (1) is appointed for
purposes of the obligatory rites, (3) the *Viśesavṛta, i.e*., one who is
appointed at the subsequent sacrifices.’
