When the Father and Mother beget one through mutual desire,—this that he is born in the womb is to be regarded as his “production.”—(147)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

These two verses are purely valedictory.

‘*When the Father and. Mother beget him*’—the child—‘*through mutual
desire*’—in secret, under the influence of desire.

‘*Should be regarded as his production*;’—that the child is born in the
womb of the Mother—*i.e*., b ecomes endowed with his several limbs—this
is mere *production*. And those entities that have their *production*
are sure to be destroyed; so that what is the use of that ‘production’
which is doomed to immediate destruction?—(117)
