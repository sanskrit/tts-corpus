The words ‘mother,’ etc., have their meanings well known;—‘*own*’
uterine.

‘*As may not* *insult* *him*’—‘insulting’ here means *disregard*;
*i.e*., refusal—‘I shall give nothing.’ Says the *Gṛhya* *sūtra*—‘He
should beg from such man or woman as may not refuse him.’

What is meant here by ‘*first*’ is the begging that is done by the boy
during Initiation. In the course of the subsequent daily bogging, he
should not fear refusal.—(50)

Burnell remarks that ‘this begging of alms is now obsolete But so far as
the formality is concerned, it is still gone through at the close of the
*Upanayaṇa* ceremony.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 59) as laying down the rule
relating to that alms-begging which is done as part of the
Upanayaṇa-ceremony.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitittva* (p. 936), which adds that these ladies are
to be approached only if they happen to be on the spot, and the boy is
not to go to their houses;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 34), which latter
quotes it only with a view to explain that there is no inconsistency
between this injunction and the later prohibition (2. 184) of begging
from one’s relations; because the former refers to the *begging* as part
of the *Upanayana* ceremony, whereas the prohibition applies to the
usual begging of food during the entire period of studentship.

It is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 61), which adds that this rule
refers to the ‘alms-begging’ which forms part of the Upanayaṇa rite;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 109), which adds the same note;—and in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 288), which has the same remarks, and notes that
the first ‘*vā*’ is meant to be emphatic—‘*nija*’ means
*uterine*,—‘*avamāna*’ means disregard, refusal to give alms.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 483) also explains that this refers to the
first ‘begging’ (at the *Upanayaṇa*),
