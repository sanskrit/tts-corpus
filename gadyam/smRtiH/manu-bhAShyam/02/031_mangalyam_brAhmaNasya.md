<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The Author now proceeds to determine the form of the name to be given to
the child.

‘*Maṅgalyam*,’ ‘*auspicious*,’ means ‘*maṅgalāya hitam*,’ or ‘*maṅgalāya
sādhu*,’ ‘conducive to welfare.’ The ‘welfare’ meant here is that which
consists in the fulfilment of something desirable, in the shape of
longevity, wealth and such other things as lead to physical and mental
pleasure. And a term can be said to be ‘conducive,’—‘*hita*’ or
‘*sādhu*,’—to this welfare, only when it connotes it; and it is in this
sense that we have the Nominal Affix (‘*yat*,’ in ‘*maṅgalyam*’).
Further, by being ‘conducive’ it is not meant that it should always
express the actual fulfilment of a desirable thing; but that it may also
express the desirable thing itself.

This connotation of the desirable thing may be either (a) by means of
compounds, such as ‘*āyuḥsiddhi*’ (accomplishment, of longevity),
‘*dhanasiddhi*’ (acquisition of wealth), ‘*putralāhha*’ (obtaining of a
son), and so forth,—or (*b*) by a nominal affix connoting
‘conduciveness’ ‘effectiveness,’ or ‘purpose.’ But the *Gṛhyasūtra* has
prohibited the use of a name ending in a Nominal affix—‘One should fix a
name ending with a Verbal, not one with a nominal affix’—says Pāraskara.
And as for compounds also, there is a combination of the denotations of
two words; so that there is a chance of the name consisting of many
letters; the lext is going to lay down certain appendages to the actual
names, such as ‘the name of Brāhmaṇa should end in *Śarman*, and so
forth’ (Manu, 2.32); so that if the name consists of three or four
letters, along with the appendage ‘*śarman*,’ it would oome to consist
of five or six letters; and this would go against the rule that ‘the
name should consist of two or four letters.’ (Baudhāyana and Āpastamba).
From all this it follows that such words should he employed as names as
are connotative of things that are desired by most people,—*e.g*., son,
cattle, landed property, daughter, wealth and so forth; and these should
end with the term ‘**śarm*an*.’ Thus it is that such names become
possible as ‘*Go-**śarm**an*.’ ‘*Dhana-**śarm**an*,’
‘*Hiraṇya-**śarm**an*,’ ‘*Kalyāṇa-**śarm**an*,’ ‘*Maṅgala-**śarm**an*,’
and so on.

Or, the term ‘*maṅgala*’ may be taken as standing for ‘*Dharma*,’
‘*Merit*’; and ‘*maṅgalya*’ in that case would mean *that which is
conducive to merit* (meritorious).

“What is it that is *conducive to merit?*”

All those words that constitute the names of Deities; *e.g., ‘Indra*,’
‘*Agni*,’ ‘*Vāyū*’; also the names of sages—*e.g*., ‘*Vasiṣṭha*,’
‘*Viśvāmiṭra*,’ ‘*Medhātithi*’; these latter also are ‘conducive to
merit’; as is clearly indicated by such directions as—(a) ‘one should
make offerings to the sages,’ (*b*) ‘one should meditate upon the men of
pious deeds,’ ‘one who desires prosperity should, on rising in the
morning, repeat the names of Deities, sages and of the Brāhmaṇas of
pious deeds.’

The epithet ‘*mangalya*,’ ‘*auspicious*’ (meritorious) serves to
preclude all ‘inauspicious’ names, such as ‘*Yama*,’ ‘*Mṛtyu*’ and the
like; and also those that are meaningless—such, as ‘*Ḍittha*’ and the
like.

‘*That of the Kṣatriya connected with power*,’—*i.e., expressive of
power*. The ‘*anvaya*’ (expressed by ‘*anvita*’ in the compound
‘*balānvita*’ means *connection*; and the only connection that a word
can have with a thing is the relation, of being connotative of
it.—‘*Power*’ is *strength*; and the word, that connotes this should be
used as the name for the *Kṣatriya,e.g*., ‘*Śatruntapa*,’
‘*Duryodhana*,’ ‘*Prajāpāla*.’ The several kinds of names have been
mentioned (in the text), as indicative of the several castes.

Similarly, ‘*that of the Vaiśya Associated with wealth*.’ It is not
meant that only synonyms of ‘*dhana*’ should be used,—such as ‘*Dhana*’
‘*Vitta*,’ ‘*Svāpateya*,’—but that any word that may be in any way
connotative of wealth should be used. Or, what is meant is that either
such words as ‘*dhana*’ (‘wealth’) and the like should be used, or such
as signify connection with wealth; such as ‘*Dhanakarman*,’
‘*Mahādhana*,’ ‘*Goman*,’ ‘*Dhānyag?aha*.’

Throughout this verse, such is the meaning—of the term ‘connected with
power’ and ‘associated with wealth.’ If this were not what is meant, the
text would have said simply ‘the *names of power* should be used.’ And
in that case, since the words actually denotative of *power* would be
very few in number, while the number of individuals to be named would be
endless,—all usage (based oh names) would come to an end.

‘*That of the Śūdra contemptible*,’—such as ‘*Kṛpaṇaka*,’ ‘*Dīna*,’
‘*Śavaraka*,’ and so forth.—(31)

This verse is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kālasāra, p. 217);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 53) to the effect that the names of the
four castes should consist of words expressive respectively, of welfare,
strength, wealth and deprecation;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra p.
346);—and in *Saṃskāra-mayūkha* (p. 25).

Burnell—‘This is now obsolete. The names of the different castes are now
usually epithets or titles of some favourite deity. The caste is known
only by the suffixed title.’

This verse has been quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskā ra, p. 242), where
we have the following explanations: ‘*maṅgalyam*’ means *expressive* of
*auspiciousness*; e.g., the name ‘*Lakṣmīdhara*’;—‘*Balānvitam*’ means
*expressive of bravery*, e.g., the name
‘*Yudhiṣṭhira*;’—‘*dhanasamyuktam*’, means *containing terms expressive
of wealth*; e.g., the name ‘*Mahādhana*’;—‘*jugupsitam*’ means
*containing a term denoting depreciation*; e.g., the name ‘*Naradāsa*’.

*Madanapārijāta* also quotes this verse (on p. 357), where it is
explained to mean that ‘the names should be expressive of auspiciousness
and the rest’

*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 441) quotes it as also the four typical
names as—‘*Śrī Śarmā*’ ‘*Vikramapālo*’, *Māṇikyaśreṣṭhi and
Hīnadāsa*;—it is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 27) as laying down rules
regarding the first part of the name.

*Śaṅkha* (Smṛti, 2.3).—‘The name of all castes should consist of an even
number of letters; an auspicious one for the Brāhmaṇa, one endowed with
strength for the Kṣatriya.’

*Viṣṇu* (Smṛti, 1.27.6-9).—‘The Brāhmaṇa’s name should be expressive of
auspiciousness—the Kṣatriya’s expressive of strength,—the Vaiśya’s
expressive of wealth,—the Śūdra’s expressive of depreciation.’

*Vīramitrodaya* (Śaṃskāra, p. 237).—Names are of four kinds;

1.  connected with family-deity,
2.  connected with month,
3.  connected with asterism,
4.  and temporal.

(*a*) Says Śaṅkha.—‘The father should fix a name connected with the
family-deity,’ *i.e*., a name consisting of words expressive of the
Deity.

(*b*) Gārgya.—‘The father should impart to the hoy the name of the month
and the name of the preceptor. The months have been declared to have the
following names:—

1.  Mārgaśīrṣa—Kṛṣṇa,
2.  Pauṣa—Ananta,
3.  Māgha—Achyuta,
4.  Phālguna—Chakrī,
5.  Caitra—Vaikuṇṭha,
6.  Vaiśākha,—Janārdana,
7.  Jyaiṣṭha,—Upendra,
8.  Āṣāḍha—Yajñapuruṣa.
9.  Śrāvaṇa—Vāsudeva.
10. Bhādra—Hari,
11. Āśvina—Yogīśa,
12. Kārttika—Puṇḍarīkākṣa.’

(*c*) Śaṅkha-Likhita.—‘Either the father or some other senior member of
the family should fix a name connected with the asterism.’ This name has
been held to be the one to be used when the person bearing the name
accosts a superior.

Says Baudhāyana—‘This name in accordance with the asterism is the secret
one, which is known only to the father and the mother and which the boy
is to use in accosting.’

Also Āśvalāyana—‘The accosting name should be known only to the father
and the mother; as it is under this name that the boy is initiated.’

Also Śaunaka, ‘That name under which he is to be initiated, and by which
he will do the accosting of the teacher,—should also be fixed at the
time of the naming ceremony. This accostive name should be pronounced by
the father very silently, so that others may not know it. This
initiative name the parents should bear in mind.’

Like the names attached to the months the names attached to the
asterisms are as follows:—

1.  Agni (Kṛttikā),
2.  Prajāpati (Rohiṇī),
3.  Soma (Mṛgaśiras),
4.  Rudra (Ārdrā),
5.  Diti (Punarvasū),
6.  Bṛhaspati (Puṣvā),
7.  Sarpa (Aśleṣā),
8.  Pitṛ (Maghā),
9.  Bhaga (Purvaphalgunī),
10. Aryamā (Uttaraphalgunī),
11. Savitṛ (Hastā),
12. Tvaṣtṛ (Chitrā),
13. Āyuṣ (Svātī),
14. Indra-Agni (Viśākhā),
15. Mitra (Anurādhā),
16. Indra (Jyeṣṭhā),
17. Nirṛti (Mūlā),
18. Apas (Pūrvāṣāḍhā),
19. Viśvedevas (Uttarāṣāḍhā),
20. Viṣṇu (Śravaṇā),
21. Vasu (Dhaniṣṭhā),
22. Varuṇa (Śatabhiṣa),
23. Ajaikapāt (Pūrvabhādra),
24. Ahirbudhnya (Uttarabhādra),
25. Pūṣan (Revatī),
26. Aśvins (Aśvinī),
27. Yama (Bharaṇī).

But according to Baudhāyana, the “name connected with the asterism” is
in accordance with the names of the asterisms themselves—such as
‘Rohiṇī,’ ‘Bharaṇī,’ and the rest; and not in accordance with the name
of the deity attached to each asterism. According to the astrologers
however each asterism has four letters assigned to it (such as
*chū-che-cho-la*, assigned to Aśvinī, and so forth, and “the name
connected with the asterism of Aśvinī,” would be the name whose first
letter consists of one of these four letters).

(*d*) The ‘temporal name’ has been described by Bṛhaspati as ‘conducive
to all kinds of business.’ It is this name that has been laid down by
Āśvalāyana as having for its first letter one of the ghoṣa-letters, in
its middle one of the *antastha* letters; ending with the *visarga*,
containing either two or four vowels; and in male names the number of
letters should always be even.

But Baijavāpa—‘The father fixes the name, which consists of either two
or three or four letters, or of unlimited number of letters.’

Vaśiṣṭha—‘The name should consist of either two or four vowels, but
those ending in *l* or *r* should be avoided.’

The Mahābhāṣya—‘The first letter of the name should be *ghoṣa-vat*, the
middle one of the *antastha* letters, it should not be similar to the
names of the ancestors, or of the enemy; it should be one formed with a
verbal affix, not with a nominal affix.’

Āśvalāyana—‘That name is best which consists of either four or two
letters, which is in consonance with that of the *grandfather*’ (this
last includes also the *gods*).

Kapila-Saṃhitā—‘On the eleventh day, in due form, the name should be
given, which is in consonance with the family-custom, and resembles the
name of the gods or of the parents.’

*Baijavāpa* (Aparārka, p. 27).—‘The father gives a name either of one
letter or two letters or three letters or four letters, or of letters
without limit; it should be one formed with a verbal, never with a
nominal, affix.’
