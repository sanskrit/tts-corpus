<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This enumeration of the organs is as laid down in other sources of
information; and the present text is not intended to lay down the number
of organs. The description is provided by our author only on account of
his good will towards his audience. The organs have been *named by the
ancient sages*; and I shall now describe their names and also their
function.

‘*In due order*.’— Implies *absence of confusion*.

The reference to the ‘*ancient sages*’ is meant to indicate that the
enumeration of the organs is not something invented by the logicians, it
was something already known among the ancient teachers. In fact, people
not knowing this are ridiculed by men as ‘not learned in the
scriptures’; hence these should be properly understood.

The meaning of the words of the text are well known, and have been
already explained.—(89)

**(Verses 89-92)  
**

*Sāṅkhya-sūtra, 2*. 17-20.—‘The eleven rudimentary elements are its
products;—the internal organ, along with the five organs of action and
ṭhe five organs of sensation constitute the group of eleven;—the Manas
is of the nature of both.’

*Sāṅkhya-Kārīkā* (26-27).—‘The organs of sensation are the Eye, the Ear,
the Nose, the Tongue and Skin; and speech the hands, the feet, the arms
and the reproductive organs are the organs of action.’

*Śaṅkha* (7. 25).—‘Eye, Ear, Skin, Taste, Nose should be known as the
organs of sensation in the body; the two hands, ṭhe two feet, the
reproductive organ, the tongue (organ of speech) and the arms are the
five organs of action in the body.’

*Kāmandaka* (1. 31, 33).—‘The Auditory, the Tactile, the, Visual, the
Gustatory and the Olfactory organs,—these five and the arms, the penis,
the arms, the legs and the organ of speech constitute what is called the
conglomeration of sense-organs. The soul and the mind are styled the
*internal senses*:... by the conjoint action of these two, volition is
engendered.
