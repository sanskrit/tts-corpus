‘*The teacher’s ladies*’—wives—‘*belonging* *to the same caste*’—of the
same caste as the teacher,—‘*should be honoured like the teacher*’—by
carrying out their orders and so forth.

‘*Those not belonging to the same caste*’ are to be honoured only ‘*with
rising and salutations*.’ The plural number in ‘salutations’ has the
sense of ‘*et cetera*’: hence the doing of what is agreeable and
beneficial, the non-mimicking of gait, etc., also become included.—(210)

teachers.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (1. 7.27).—‘The behaviour towards the teacher’s
wives should be similar to that towards the teacher; with the exception
of the clasping of the feet and the eating of the leavings.’

210	The wives of the teacher, who belong to the same caste, must be treated as respectfully as the teacher; but those who belong to a different caste, must be honoured by rising and salutation.
