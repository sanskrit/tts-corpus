The *Mind* is what completes the number, which is the number of
sense-organs.

The ‘*own quality*’ of Mind is volition, desire; it is with the Mind
that people will or desire both what is good and what is bad. \[This is
what is meant by its being ‘*of twofold nature*’\]. Or, the Mind may be
regarded as ‘of two-fold nature’ in the sense that it partakes of the
character of both sets of organs—those of sensation as well as those of
action; as the functioning of both these sets of organs is rooted in
volition.

‘*On this being subdued*,’ both five-membered groups,—*i.e*., the group
of the organs of sensation, as well as that of the organs of action,
which have been described above,—become subdued.

This only describes a real fact.—(92)
