‘*Beyond*’—after—the said time, ‘*all* *these three*’ castes—the
Brāhmaṇa and the rest;—‘*at the proper time*’—at the exact time
prescribed for each caste, or even at the secondary period
permitted;—‘*not having received the sacrament*’—not having their
*Upanayana-* ceremony performed;—‘*excluded from Sāvitrī*’—become fallen
off from Initiation; and also ‘*come to he known as
Vrātyas*’—‘*despised*,’ looked down upon, ‘by *all good men*’ by
respectable and cultured people.

This verse is intended to explain the signification of the well known
name ‘*Vrātya*’ That they become excluded from Initiation has already
been implied in the preceding verse.

It has been said that they ‘are despised by good men’; the next verse
explains the nature of contempt in which they are held.—(39)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Ācāra, p. 446), and in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 36), where it is explained that on the expiry of
the limit mentioned in verse 38, the boy becomes a ‘*Vrātya*,’
‘apostate’, and can be invested only after having become sanctified by
the performance of the *Vrātyastoma* rite.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 36) goes on to add that the dumb and the insane, as
never fit for the sacraments, are not to be regarded as ‘apostates’ by
reason of the omission of the sacraments; so that in the event of their
having children these latter do not lose their Brāhmaṇa-hood or their
right to the sacraments.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 347) quotes this verse as from Manu and
Yama both.
