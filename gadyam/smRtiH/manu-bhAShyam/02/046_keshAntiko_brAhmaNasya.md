The term ‘staff’ denotes the particular shape (of the wood carried);—a
long piece of wood of a well-defined size is called ‘*staff*.’

The question arising as to what its length should be, the Text answers
it. That which reaches up to the end of the hair is called
‘*Keśāntika*,’ *i.e*., reaching up to the head; *i.e*., in size it
should reach from the tip of the foot up to the head. Or, the compound
‘*Keśānta*.’ may be expounded as ‘that of which the hair forms the end,’
the *ka* coming in as an additional affix at the end of the compound.

‘*In size*,’—the staff—‘*should be made*’ of the said size,—‘*for the
Brāhmaṇa*,’—*i.e*., by the Teacher.

‘*Reaching to the forehead*’—*i.e*., of the size reaching up to the
forehead. The ‘forehead’ itself is only four inches in width; and as a
piece of wood of that size could never be spoken of as ‘staff,’ we have
to explain the term ‘*lalāṭasamnitaḥ*’ (which, as it stands, means ‘of
the size of the forehead’) as meaning ‘that which reaches from the tip
of the foot up to the forehead.’

Similarly for the Vaiśya, it should reach up to the tip of the
nose.—(46)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 930), which adds that in the
event of the specified wood not being available any one of the woods
recommended for the three castes may be used for any one of these
three;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 22);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
436), which last explains ‘*Keśāntikaḥ*’ as ‘*Mūrdhāpramāṇaḥ*’;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 448);—in *Aparārka* (p. 57);—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p.43b);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
78), which explains ‘*Keśāntikaḥ*’ as *reaching up to the head*.
