‘*Keśānta*—Hair-clipping. is—the name of a particular sacrament. This
sacrament should be done, for the Brāhmaṇa, in his sixteenth year, from
conception. For a knowledge of the exact form of this sacrament our only
source is the Gṛhyasūtra.

‘*Two years later*’—*i.e*., in the year, which is two years later than
the twenty-second. Or, the compound may be taken as qualifying ‘time,’
so that the meaning is—‘at the time which comes two years later than the
twenty-second,’—‘*for the Vaiśya*.’ The numeral adjective ‘two’ must be
taken as qualifying *years*; as the whole verse refers to *years*.—(65)

This verse is quoted in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 444);—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 778);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 107);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 637), which explains *Dvyadhike* as in the
twenty-fourth year;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 353), which explains
*rājānyabandhuḥ* as *Kṣatriya* and *Dvyadhike* as *twenty-fourth*.

Another name for the *Keśānta* sacrament mentioned in Saṃskāramayūkha is
‘*Godāna*,’ which has been etymologically explained as —*gāvaḥ
keśāḥ-dīyante chidyante yasmin*.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 457), where it is
said that this rite is what is called ‘godāna’;—and in *Aparārka* (p.
67), which adds that the numbers here mentioned are to be counted from
*birth* and not from *conception*, for if the latter were meant, the
word used would have been ‘*garbhaṣoḍaśa*’ like ‘*garbhaṣṭama*.’
