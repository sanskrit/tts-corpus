‘*Mātuḥ*—from the mother;—‘*agre*’—first—‘*adhijananam*,’—birth, of man.

‘*The second*, *after the girdle-tying ceremony*’;—*i.e*., after the
*Upamyana*. The short vowel ‘*i*’ in the term ‘*mauñjibandhane*’ is
according to Pāṇini 6-3-63, by which there is much latitude given in
regard to vowels contained in proper names.

‘*The third*, *after sacrificial initiation*,’—such as the Jyotiṣṭoma
and the rest. This initiation also has been described as ‘birth’ in such
passages as—‘when the priests initiate the sacrificer, they bring about
a repetition of birth.’

These arc the three births of twice-born men, described in tho Veda.

“In that case the man becomes *thrice-born*.”

Let that be so; as a matter of fact, the Upanayana is the basis of the
name ‘twice-born’;—and it is on this name that the man’s title to the
performance of *Śrauta*, *Smārta* and conventional rites is based. Tho
mention of the first and third

‘births’ is simply for the purpose of eulogising the second one, which
is the best of all births; \[As regards the third birth\] it is only the
performance of sacrifices to which the uninitiated man is not entitled;
while the one who has not undergone the *Upanayana* ceremony is not
entitled to any religious act at all.

Others hold, that it is ‘Fire-kindling’ that is here spoken of as
‘sacrificial initiation,’ on the ground of its Leing the forerunner of
all sacrifices. That Fire-kindling also is regarded as a ‘birth’ is
shown by such passages as—‘he who does not kindle the fire is as good as
unborn.’—(169)

Hopkins is not quite accurate in his interjectory remark—“So the *twice*
-born has *three* births!” It is not every twice-born person that has
three births; the third ‘birth’ belongs to only that twice-born person
who is initiated for a sacrifice. Hopkins might as well exclaim in
connection with the next verse—“So the twice-born has two mothers and
two fathers!”

*Vaśiṣṭha* (2. 3)—(reproduces the first part of Manu).

*Viṣṇu* (27. 37)—(reproduces the first part of Manu).

*Yājñavalkya* (1. 39).—‘For the first time, the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya
and the Vaiśya are born from their mother; for the second time, out of
the girdle-tying Rite (of Upanayana); it is for this reason that they
have been declared to be *twice-born*.’
