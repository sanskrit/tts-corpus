For reasons stated above,—‘*of these two*’—of the father and the
mother,—‘*and of the preceptor*,’—‘*always*’—as long as one lives,—‘*he
should do what is pleasing to*’; and one should not be satisfied with
acting agreeably to them once, twice or thrice only.

‘*On these three*’—preceptor and the rest—‘*being satisfied*’—*i.e*.,
when they have been propitiated by devoted service,—‘*all austerity*’;
*i.e*., the rewards that Are obtained by the performance of the
‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ and other penances for several years are obtained from
the satisfaction of these three.—(228)
