But the “birth” which the Preceptor, well-versed in the Veda, brings about for him, in the lawful manner, by means of the Sāvitrī,—that is real, imperishable, immortal.—(148)

The ‘birth’ that the Boy obtains from his Preceptor is however
indestructible. When the Veda has been got up and its meaning duly
comprehended, then alone is one enabled to perform religious acts, by
which he obtains Heaven and Final Release; and since all this is due to
the Preceptor, he is superior.

‘*That birth which the Preceptor brings about*’—*i.e*., the sacramental
rite called ‘*Upanayana*’ ‘initiation,’ which is called the ‘second
birth,’ which he accomplishes—‘*by means of the Sāvitrī*’—*i.e*., by the
expounding of it;—‘*that*’—birth—‘*imperishable, immortal*.’ Though all
these words mean the same thing, yet they have been used with a view to
pointing out that the ‘birth’ named ‘Initiation’ is superior to that
which one obtains from his mother. As a matter of fact, ‘perishing’ and
‘death’ are not possible for ‘birth,’ as they are in the case of living
beings; if mere ‘indestructibility’ were meant, this could have been
expressed by means of a single word; and yet this is not what is done
(which shows that the meaning is as explained above).

The construction of the sentence is as follows:—‘*Vedapāraga ācāryo
yāñjātim vidhivat sāvitryā*—*i.e*., by means of the full details of the
Initiatory Rite, which is what is indicated by the term
*sāvitrī—utpādayati*—is what is superior.’ ‘*Jāti*’ stands for
‘*janma*,’ birth.—(148)

148	But that birth which a teacher acquainted with the whole Veda, in accordance with the law, procures for him through the Savitri, is real, exempt from age and death.
