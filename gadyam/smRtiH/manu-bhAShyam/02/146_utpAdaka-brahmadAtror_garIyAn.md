Between the progenitor and the imparter of the veda, the imparter op the veda is the more venerable father; for the brāhmaṇa’s “birth” is the veda, eternally,—here as well as after death.—(146)

‘*Progenitor*’—is one who gives natural birth; ‘*Imparter of the Veda*’
is one who teaches;—both these are ‘*fathers*’; and between these two
‘fathers,’ that Father is ‘*more venerable*’ who imparts the Veda. So
that when the Father and the Preceptor are both present, the Preceptor
should be saluted first.

The text adds a valedictory statement in support of what has been
said—‘*The Brāhmaṇa’s birth is the Veda*’; *i.e*., is for the purpose of
learning the Veda; the compound ‘*brahmajanma*’ being expounded as
‘*brahmagrahaṇārtham janma*,’ according to the *Vārtika* on ‘Pāṇini’
2.1.60. According to this explanation of the compound, the Initiatory
Rite would be ‘the birth for the learning of the Veda.’ Or, the compound
‘*brahmajanma*’ may be explained as ‘birth consisting in the form of
learning the Veda.’

This, for the Brāhmaṇa, is *eternally*—ever—*beneficial*—‘*here*’ and
‘*beneficial after death*’ also.—(110)

For the apparent inconsistency between this and the preceding verse, see
*note* above.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 305), in support of
the view that the ‘*Ācārya*’ also, in certain cases, is superior to the
Father and Mother;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 32), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Brahmajanma*’ means *birth from Veda*, i. e.
*Upanayana*; ‘*after death?*—because it creates in the boy the capacity
to attain all the good, even the Final Release,—as also ‘*here*’—by
reason of creating the capacity to perform all religious rites,—it is
‘*eternally*’—the bringer about of lasting good.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 479) simply quotes the verse.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 97) in support of the view that the
orders of the Teacher carry more weight than those of the Father;—it
explains ‘*brahmadaḥ*’ as ‘the teacher’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 93), which adds that ‘*brahmadaḥ*’ stands for the
*Ācārya*, not the *Upādhyāya*, as is clear from the second line which
means—‘because he gives that *birth which serves the purpose of Vedic
study*, *i.e*. the Upanayana, he is superior.’

146	Of him who gives natural birth and him who gives (the knowledge of) the Veda, the giver of the Veda is the more venerable father; for the birth for the sake of the Veda (ensures) eternal (rewards) both in this (life) and after death.
