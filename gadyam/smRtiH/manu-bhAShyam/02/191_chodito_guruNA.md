‘*Prompted*’—ordered—‘*by the teacher, he put forth his exertion*’—make
an effort—‘*to study*.’

“It has been already laid down that ‘one should rend when wanted by the
Teacher.’ How then can there he any exertion put forth by one who is
*not prompted*?”

What is here said refers to the student who has learnt a part of the
Veda, and is going to learn the remainder; for this latter the
‘instruction of the teacher’ is not necessary.

Similarly he should do, without being told to do so, such helpful acts
for the teacher as fetching jars of water, massaging his body whenever
he happens to be fatigued, and so forth.—(191)
