Neither by years, nor by grey hair, nor by wealth, nor by relatives (is greatness attained); since the sages have made the law that ‘he who teaches is the greatest among us.’—(154)

This is another eulogy of the teacher.

‘*Hāyana*’ is synonymous with ‘*samvatsara*,’ ‘years.’ One does not
become *great*—venerable—by being advanced in age by many years;—‘*nor
by grey hair*’—*i.e*., by the hairs of the head and beard becoming
white;—‘*nor by (much) wealth*’;—‘*nor by relatives*,’—does one acquire
the aforesaid title to respect. One does not become ‘great’ even by all
these taken together; but by *learning* alone. And this because ‘*the
sages have made the law*,’—‘*Ṛṣi*,’ ‘*sage*,’ is so called by reason of
his sublime vision. The meaning is that the ‘seers’ of the text and
meaning of the entire Veda, have come to the conclusion and laid down
this law—‘*he who teaches*’—‘teaching’ means instructing in the Veda
along with all its subsidiaries—‘*is the greatest*’—most
venerable—‘*among us*.’

The term ‘*made*’ stands for *laying* not for bringing into existence
what did not exist before.—(154)

‘*Anūcānaḥ*’—‘Teacher of the Veda’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘he who
has learnt the Veda’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa, Nandana and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 305);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p. 480);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
93), which explains the meaning as, ‘the sages have not laid down the
principle that greatness depends on years and the rest; what they have
asserted is that among us he is great who is the best expounder of the
‘Veda.’

“This verse with the following one is proverbial, and is repeated
several times in the Mahābhārata and the other law-books.”—Hopkins.

154	Neither through years, nor through white (hairs), nor through wealth, nor through (powerful) kinsmen (comes greatness). The sages have made this law, 'He who has learnt the Veda together with the Angas (Anukana) is (considered) great by us.'
