From among all the organs, if one happens to ooze out, then thereby his wisdom oozes out, just like water from one part of the leathern bag.—(99)

\[In the term ‘*indriyāṇāṃ*’\] the Genitive has the force of
specification.

If even *one* *organ* *happens to ooze out*;—*i.e*., if on functioning
freely in regard to its object, it is not checked,—then ‘*his wisdom
oozes out*’;—*i.e*., his steadiness in regard to the other organs also
(disappears).

‘*Leathern bag*’;—a vessel for carrying water, made of the skin of the
goat and other animals. Even though all the other parts of this bag be
closed, if water trickles out of a single part of it, the whole bag
becomes empty.

In the same manner, the man’s steadiness acquired through continuous
practice of wisdom,—or even true wisdom and knowledge itself—(becomes
entirely lost). That is, being addicted to several objects, he has his
mind always turned towards them, so that the subjects dealt with by
reasonings and scriptures do not present themselves to him in the right
manner.—(99)

‘*Prajñā*’—‘Wisdom, control over the senses’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja,
and Rāghavānanda);—‘knowledge of truth’ (Kullūka).

‘*Pādāt*’—This may be taken literally in the sense of *foot*; as Hopkins
rightly remarks—“The hide often is used in oriental countries complete,
each leg being made water-tight.” This is indicated by Medhātithi’s
remarks also.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 493) where the
‘*dṛti*’ is explained as a ‘leathern bag.’ It is quoted to show that
during studentship the strict observance of the vows and restraints is
essential.

*Kaṭha*, (3. 7).—‘He who is devoid of wisdom, his mind not firm,—his
organs get beyond control,—like vicious horses under the charioteer.’

*Bhagavadgītā*, (3. 67).—‘When the mind follows in the wake of the
roaming senses, it deprives him of his wisdom, and it is lost like the
boat at sea.’

099	But when one among all the organs slips away (from control), thereby (man's) wisdom slips away from him, even as the water (flows) through the one (open) foot of a (water-carrier's) skin.
