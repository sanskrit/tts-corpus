अयं लोकः पृथिवी । भारसहत्वात् तुल्या माता पृथिव्या । **पितृभक्त्या** मध्यमो लोको ऽन्तरिक्षम् । प्रजापतिः पितोक्तः । मध्यमस्थानश् च प्रजापतिर् नैरुक्तानाम् । स हि वर्षकर्मणां प्रजानां पाता वा पालयिता वा । **ब्रह्मलोकम्** आदित्यलोकम् । आदित्यो ब्रह्मेत्यादेशः । **लोकः** स्थानविशेषस् तम् **अश्नुते** प्राप्नोति । 

- अर्थवादा एते । तत्र नाभिनिवेष्टव्यम् । न च लोकाधिपत्यकामस्य तदाराधनाधिकारः । नायं काम्यो विधिः । पितृत्वम् एवात्र निमित्तम्, अकरणे शास्त्रातिक्रमः ॥ २.२३३ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*This region*;’—*i.e*., the Earth; the Mother being equal to the Earth,
on account of both of them being capable of bearing burdens.

‘*By devotion to his* *Father*, *the middle region*;’—*i.e*., the sky.
The Father has been described as Prajāpati; and according to the
followers of the Nirukta, Prajāpati has his abode in the middle Region;
and he is the sustainer or protector of men.

‘*The Region of Brahman*’—*i.e*., the solar region; according to the
declaration (in the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad*) that ‘the Sun is Brahman, such
is the teaching.’

‘*Region*’—means a particular place.

‘*Acquires*’—gains.

All this is a purely commendatory statement; and much attention need not
be paid to it. Nor is it that only persons desirous of sovereignty over
the said regions are to do honour to the Rather, etc.; for the
injunction is not an optional one. In fact, the mere fact of the person
being one’s father is the sole condition of his being honoured; and the
omission of it involves a transgression of the scriptures.—(233)

233	By honouring his mother he gains this (nether) world, by honouring his father the middle sphere, but by obedience to his teacher the world of Brahman.
