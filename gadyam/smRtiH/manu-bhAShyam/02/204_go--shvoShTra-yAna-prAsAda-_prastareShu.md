The terra ‘cart’ is connected with each of the foregoing terras; and the
cart yoked with, drawn by, oxen (), ‘horses’ (‘*aśva*’) and ‘camels’
(*uṣṭra*) is called ‘*gośvoṣṭvayānam?*’; the terra ‘*yukta*’ (‘yoked,’
‘drawn by’) being dropped, as in the word ‘*dadhighāṭa*’ (‘curd-jar’).
That this is so is clear from the fact that it is not possible for two
men to ride together on the hare back of the ox, etc. If we had the word
‘*yāna*’ standing by itself, then we might have taken the verse itself
as permitting the riding along with the teacher on the bare back of the
ox, etc. In some places we do find this to he permitted by usage.

‘*Terrace*,’—the surface on the top of houses; and in such places
sitting with the Teacher is as possible as on the floor of houses.

‘*Grass-mats*’—beds made of grass and leaves, etc.

‘*Reed-mats*’—beds made of reeds and sticks.

‘*Bocks*’—stone-slabs either on the top of hills or elsewhere.

‘*Benches*’—scats made of wood, called ‘*pota*,’ ‘*varta*,’ etc.

‘*Boats*’;—*i.e*., contrivances for floating on water, which would
include rafts and other similar things.—(204)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 107);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462) where ‘*phalakam*’ is explained as
*Kāṣṭhanirmitam dīrghāsanam*, ‘a long seat made of wood’, a bench:—also
on page 491, where it is quoted in support of the view that the
prohibition contained in verse 198 must refer to cases other than those
of carts and conveyances. It further adds that though the riding on
conveyances drawn by ox etc. is prohibited,—yet the sanction accorded
here is in view of the possibility of such lading in abnormal times of
distress. It is interesting to note that no such scruples have
prejudiced Medhātithi, who apparently belonged to a part of the country
where riding on bullock-carts is permissible; while the author of
*Vīramitrodaya* belonged to a part of the country where such riding is
prohibited, e.g. in Mithilā.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 120) as sanctioning, in
certain cases, the sitting of the pupil with the teacher.

*Baudhāyana* (1. 2. 35).—‘There is nothing wrong in sitting with the
Teacher on a boat, or a stone-slab, or an elephant, or the roof of a
house, or a mat, or on a wheeled conveyance.’ *Āpastamba Dharmasūtra*
(1. 8. 12).—‘In a journey he should ascend the conveyance behind the
Teacher.’

*Viṣṇu* (28.27, 28).—‘He should not sit on the same seat with the
