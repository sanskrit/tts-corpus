अन्यो ऽपि न कश्चिद् अवमन्तव्यः, एते पुनर् विशेषतः । प्रायश्चित्ताधिक्यम् अत्रेत्य् अर्थः । **आर्त्तेन** तैः पीडितेनाप्य् । **अवमानम्** अवज्ञा, प्राप्तायाः पूजाया अकरणं न्यक्कारश् चानादराख्यः । ब्राह्मणग्रहणं पूरणार्थम् ॥ २.२२५ ॥

In fact no one should bo treated with disrespect; specially these. That
is to say, the disrespect of these entails a heavier expiation.

‘*Distressed*’—injured by them.

‘Treating with disrespect’ consists in disregard; the omitting of honour
due; as also insulting, which is called ‘want of respect.’

The term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ has been added only for filling up the
metre.—(225)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

There is a confusion in the position of the two verses 225 and 226.
Burnell places 226—‘*Ācāryo brahmaṇo mūrtiḥ* &c.’—before 225—‘*Ācāryaśca
pitā chaiva &c*.’

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 94).
