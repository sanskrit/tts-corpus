This also is an instance of ‘Transference.’

Teachers other than the Preceptor are called here ‘intellectual
teacher’—such as the Sub-Teacher and the rest. One should behave towards
these just as it has been detailed above (under 192 *et seq*.).

‘*Towards blood-relations’—i.e*., towards the elder brother, the
paternal uncle, etc

‘*Constant behaviour*’—*i.e*., behaviour as towards the Preceptor.

As distinguished from the ‘Preceptor,’ the other ‘Intellectual Teachers’
are to be so honoured only during the period of one’s learning under
them.

‘*Towards persons*’—friends and others—‘*restraining him from
sin*’—*i.e*., from evils, such as connection with other women and so
forth. It has been said that when one is found to be thinking within
himself of doing some evil deed, then his friends and others ‘should
restrain him from sin, even to the extent of dragging him by his hairs’;
and towards one who restrains him in this way, he should behave as
towards his Teacher,—even if he happens to be of equal or inferior age.

Also towards those who give salutary advice, independently of books. Or,
‘giver of salutary advice’ may be taken as standing for noble-minded
persons in general.—(206)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462), where
‘*vidyāguru*’ is explained as ‘teachers other than the
*Ācārya*’,—‘*nityā*’, as ‘holding for all time’,—‘*svayoni*’, as ‘uncle
and the rest’,—‘*hita*’ as *dharmatattva*, ‘the essence of
Morality’;—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 34).

**(verses 206-207)  
**

*Gautama* (2.30).—‘Similarly towards respected superiors.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.1.37).—‘The eating of the leavings should be avoided in
the case of the Ācārya’s son or in that of the expounder of the Veda.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (1. 7. 29, 30).—‘Towards the older
fellow-student,—the behaviour towards the Ācārya’s son should be like
that towards the teacher, with the exception of eating the leavings.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (13.22).—‘Towards the teacher’s son, one should behave like
that towards the teacher himself,—so says the Śruti.’

*Viṣṇu* (32.1).—‘The King, the priest, the Vedic scholar, one who
prevents him from doing wrong, the sub-teacher, the paternal uncle, the
maternal grandfather, the maternal uncle, the father-in-law, the elder
brother, one’s relations,—the behaviour towards these should be like
that towards the teacher.’

206	This is likewise (ordained as) his constant behaviour towards (other) instructors in science, towards his relatives (to whom honour is due), towards all who may restrain him from sin, or may give him salutary advice.
