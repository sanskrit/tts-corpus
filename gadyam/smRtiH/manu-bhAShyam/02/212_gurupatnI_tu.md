<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*One who is full twenty years old*’;—*i.e*., fully grown up. There is
no harm in the case of the pupil who is still a ‘child,’ not having
passed his sixteenth year. What is meant is one who has completed his
twenty years. To the same effect we have the next qualification—‘*who is
conscious of what is good and what is bad*.’ The ‘good’ and ‘bad’ meant
here are the pleasures and pains arising from sexual love, also the
beauty and ugliness of women, as also their fidelity and infidelity.

In any case stress is not meant to be laid upon the number
‘*twenty*.’—(212)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462), where it is
explained that the term ‘*purṇaviṃśativarṣeṇa*’ stands for *full youth*,
and stress is not meant to be laid upon the precise age mentioned;—also
in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 301);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 104).
