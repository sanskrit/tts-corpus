This verse is only a valedictory supplement to the rule prescribed
above; it is not meant to be the statement of definite results following
from the observance of that rule. If it were a statement of results, the
rule would be an optional one, to be observed only by one who desires
vigour and strength; and in that case the adverb ‘always’ would have no
sense;—as we have in the expression, ‘*the food thus worshipped always,
etc*.’ For these reasons the rule must be regarded as one to be observed
throughout life, just like the rule regarding *facing of the east*
(during meal).

‘*If eaten irreverently, it destroys them both*,’—*i.e*., vigour and
strength.

‘*Strength'* is power, the capacity to lift heavy loads without effort;
while ‘*vigour*’stands for energy and courage, which is found even in a
man who is lean (and physically weak): while great *strength* is found
only when the limbs of the body are well-developed and the body has
attained huge proportions.—(55)

‘*Ūrjam*’.—Buhler wrongly attributes to Medhātithi the explanation that
this term means ‘bulk’. The term used by him is ‘*mahāprāṇatā*’ which
means the same as ‘*vīrya*’ of Kullūka or ‘energy’ of Nārāyaṇa. Buhler
has apparently been misled by a mis-reading of Medhātithi.

This verse has been quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 486) where
‘*pūjitam*’ has been explained as, ‘*samskṛtam*’, well prepared;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 114).
