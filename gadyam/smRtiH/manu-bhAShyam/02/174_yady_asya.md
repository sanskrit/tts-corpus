The authors of Gṛhyasūtras have laid down certain acts called
‘observances’; such for instance as, ‘for one year one desires to get up
the Veda or a part of it,’—in which connection there are observances and
vows and restraints prescribed; when one of these observances has been
completed, and another is taken up, then all the rules and regulations
that have been prescribed in connection with the Upanayana have to be
followed.

“In that case how are the skin, etc., previously taken up to be disposed
of?”

They are to be thrown into the water.

“That has been declared to be the method of disposing of things
previously taken up; but of what form would be the disposal of such of
those things as might have been destroyed (or lost)?”

As regards cases of loss, in as much as each of the things has its use
definitely prescribed in the descriptions, it naturally follows that
when one is lost, it is replaced by another; and this taking up of the
latter would constitute the ‘disposal’ of the former.

‘*That* *skin*’ which has been prescribed for a particular Religious
Student, *e.g*., ‘the skin of the *Kṛṣṇa* deer for the Brāhmaṇa, that of
the *Ruru* deer for the *Kṣatriya* and so forth.

Similarly with the *staff* and other things.

All this stands ‘*during* *the observances, also*.’ In view of the
context, ‘observances’ here must he taken as standing for ‘instruction
regarding observances.’—(174)

as standing for the *Sāvitrya* and the rest.’
