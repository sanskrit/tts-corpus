The Veda, the Smṛti, the Practice of cultured Men, and what is agreeable to oneself—these directly constitute the fourfold means of knowing Dharma.—(12)

नात्र कश्चिद् विशेषः । वेदनिन्दाप्रतिषेधेन स्मृतिसदाचारात्मतुष्टीनाम् अपि निन्दकस्य बहिष्कारो ऽनेन विहितः । तेषाम् अपि वेदमूलधर्माभिधानम् । अतः स्मृत्यादिनिन्दको वेदनिन्दक एव ।

- <u>ननु</u> श्लोकद्वयेन नार्थः । एवं वक्तव्यम्- 

- श्रुत्यादीन् आत्मतुष्ट्यन्तान् हेतुशास्त्राश्रयाद् द्विजः ।

- यो निन्देत् स बहिष्कार्यः साधुभिर् नास्तिकत्वतः ॥

- <u>उच्यते</u> । नाचार्या ग्रन्थगौरवं मन्यन्ते । बुद्धिगौरवं यत्नेन परिहरन्ति । तस्मिन् हि सति असम्यगवबोधो धर्मस्य । स च पुरुषार्थं विहन्ति । भेदनिर्देशे ऽपि हि चोदयेयुः- वेदग्रहणम् एव कर्तव्यम्, सर्वस्य धर्मस्य वैदिकत्वात् । तस्माद् विस्पष्टार्थं भेदेनोभयनिर्देशः, संक्षिप्तरुचीनां पूर्वश्लोकः, अन्येषां श्लोकद्वयम् । 

- **स्वस्य च प्रियम् आत्मनः** इत्य् अनेन प्राग् उक्ता आत्मतुष्टिर् एवोक्ता । स्वग्रहणं वृत्तपूरणार्थम् । एतत् **साक्षाद् धर्मस्य लक्षणम्** निमित्तं ज्ञापकम्, न पुनः प्रत्यक्षम् । यथा नैरुक्तम् "साक्षात्कृतधर्माणः" इति (निर् १.२०) । विधाशब्दः प्रकारवचनः । एकम् एव धर्मे प्रमाणं वेदाख्यम् । तस्य त्व् एते भेदाः स्मृत्यादयः ।

- <u>अन्ये</u> तूपसंहारार्थम् इमं श्लोकं व्याचक्षते, समाप्तं धर्मलक्षणप्रकरणम् इति । पुनःपाठः समाप्तिं सूचयति, यथा द्विरभ्यासो वेदाङ्गेषु "संस्थाजपेनोपतिष्ठन्त उपतिष्ठन्त" इति (आश्श् १.१३.१०) । तथा च पिण्डीकृत इव प्रागुक्तो ऽर्थो हृदि वर्तते । यथा नैयायिकाः "अनित्यः शब्दः"(न्सू-व् १.१.३३) इति प्रतिज्ञाय, साधनोपन्यासं कृत्वा, निगमयन्ति- "तस्माद् अनित्यः शब्दः" इति । प्रायेण चैषा ग्रन्थाकाराणां रीतिः । तथा महाभाष्यकारो ऽपि क्वचित् सूत्रं वार्तिकं वा पठित्वा व्याख्याय पुनः पठति ॥ २.१२ ॥

There is no difference here. The prohibition of detracting the Veda
implies that there should be casting out of also one who detracts the
*Smṛti*, the *Practic Men* and *Self-satisfaction*. These also describe
only such *Dharma* as is based upon the Veda; hence the detractor of
these is also the ‘detractor of the Veda.’

*Objection*:—“There is no need for having both the verses; a single
verse would have been sufficient, somewhat to the following effect:—‘the
twice-born person, who, relying upon the Science of Dialectics, should
scorn the sources of Dharma, beginning with *Veda* and ending with
*Self-satisfaction*, should be cast out by all good men, on account of
his being an infidel.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—Teachers do not mind the
burdening (prolexity) of their works; what they make every effort to
avoid is the burdening of the intellect (of the learner); as it is the
latter which interferes with the right understanding of *Dharma*; and
this misunderstanding obstructs the fulfilment of the ends of man.

Then again, even if the author had mentioned all the four sources of
Dharma (as suggested by the objector), some people might still argue
thus—“the author should have mentioned the Veda only, all *Dharma* being
based upon the Veda.” Hence it is for the purpose of clearness that the
author has stated the matter in both ways: the former verse being
intended for those who like brevity, and both the verses for other
persons.

‘*What is agreeable to oneself*’ is the same as the ‘self-satisfaction’
spoken of before. The term ‘*oneself*’ is added only for filling up the
metre.

‘*These constitute directly the means of knowing Dharma*’—‘*Lakṣaṇa*’
means *cause*, *indicator*; and *Sense-Perception* is not the means of
knowing *Dharma*, as some people have held, speaking of (the sages as)
‘persons who have directly *perceived* Dharma.’

In the compound ‘*Chaturvidham*,’ ‘*fourfold*,’ the term ‘*vidhā*’ means
*kind, form*. As a matter of fact, Veda is the only source of knowledge
of Dharma, and *Smṛti* and the rest are only so many *forms* of the
Veda.

Other people have explained this second verse as serving the purpose of
recapitulating (all that has been said regarding the sources of Dharma).
The description of the means of knowing Dharma having been finished, it
is the end of this section that is indicated by the repetition
(contained in the present verse). Such is the fashion with treatises on
the Vedāṅgas; *e.g., ‘saṃsthājapenopatiṣṭhante upatiṣṭhante*’ (when;
‘*upatiṣṭhante*’ is repeated for indicating the end of the section); and
when the author sets forth the second verse he has in his mind the
sum-total of all that has been said in the present section. It is just
as the Naiyāyikas, having propounded the Proposition that ‘Word is
non-eternal,’ set forth the reasons in support of it, and then
re-iterate the conclusion, saying ‘therefore word is non-eternal.’ In
fact such is the way of all writers; *e.g*., the author of the
*Mahābhāṣya* (Patāñjali) also sometimes states the Sūtra or the Vārtika,
and having explained it, repeats it again.—(12)
