‘*Gems*’—precious stones, even though obtained from such low-born people
as the Śabara, the Pulinda and so forth, are regarded as clean;
similarly should learning be regarded.

‘*Arts*’—*e.g*., Painting, etc., and those that have been regarded as
mean, such as clothes-washing, the colouring and tying of cloth and so
forth.

‘*From all sources*’—*i.e*., irrespective of considerations of caste.

‘*May be obtained*,’—accepted; by persons whose patience is truly
assured. Begininng with Verse 239, all that is said is syntactically
connected, and forming part of the same context, the whole is to be
regarded as a commendatory statement.—(240)

‘*Striyo ratnāni*’—‘Wives, gems’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘gem-like
wives’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse occurs in *Devalasmṛti* also (quoted in
