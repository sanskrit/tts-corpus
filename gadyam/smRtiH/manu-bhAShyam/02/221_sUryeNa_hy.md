This is a commendatory statement pertaining to the aforesaid injunction
of the expiatory rite.

He who becomes tainted by the setting of the sun,—similarly who becomes
tainted by the rising of the sun;—and he does not perform the expiatory
rite prescribed above,—then he becomes tainted by ‘*grievous*’—not
minor—‘*sin*.’ ‘Sin’ is the name of that unseen force which leads one to
suffer pain in the form of living in hell and so forth.—(221)
