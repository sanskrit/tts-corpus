Bereft of this verse, and of the timely performance of his own duty, a person of Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya or Vaiśya birth incurs the odium of good men.—(80)

‘*By this verse*’—by the *Sāvitrī*.

‘*Bereft*’;—he who fails to observe the Twilight Prayers and neglects
Vedic Study.

‘*Odium*’—Blame.

‘*Among good men*’—Among the highly cultured people.

‘*Incurs*’—becomes open to.

With a view to show what sort of odium he incurs, the Text adds—‘*and of
the timely performance of his own duty*.’—‘*Timely*’—*e.g*., the
sixteenth year for the Brāhmaṇa and so forth. When the man is bereft of
these rites, he becomes despised.

From this it is clear that even though the boy may have been
*initiated*, and as such become qualified for Vedic Study,—yet, if he is
bereft of the *Sāvitrī*, he becomes a ‘*Vrātya*,’ apostate.

What is meant by ‘*his own duty*’ is just that duty which is common to
the three castes; and this is the duty of Initiation. It is only when we
interpret it thus that the qualification ‘timely’ comes to have any
sense. If the ‘duty’ meant were the duties of Vedic Study and the rest,
the text would have said simply ‘performance of his own duty’ (without
the qualification ‘timely’).

The term ‘*yoni*’ being synonymous with ‘*birth*’ denotes *caste*. So
what is meant is the person of the Brāhmaṇa and other castes.

The present verse is only a descriptive supplement, added for the
purpose of making the Expiatory Rites prescribed for the *Vrātya*
(apostate) applicable to the omissions mentioned here.—(80)

The text of this verse, and hence its meaning, is entirely changed in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 429); the words as quoted here are,

> *etayar??'pi saṃyuktaḥ kāle?a kriyayā'mu?ā* \|  
> *?ipra?triya?i?yonirprāha?ya?ṃ yāti prādhuṣu* \|\|

it may be rendered thus—‘Equipped with this verse, and timely
performance of this act, a person of Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya or Vaiśya birth
becomes acceptable among the good.’

*Viṣṇu-smṛti*, 55.14—\[reproduces, with slight variations, the words of
Manu\].

*Baudhāyana-Dhaṛmasūtra*, 2. 4. 15.—‘Those who offer not the
Morning-prayer before the advent of Dawn, nor the Evening-prayer before
the lapse of Eve,—how can these be called Brāhmaṇas? Those Brāhmaṇas who
offer? not the? Morning and Evening Prayers, them the king should employ
in works fit for the Śūdra.

080	The Brahmana, the Kshatriya, and the Vaisya who neglect (the recitation of) that Rik-verse and the timely (performance of the) rites (prescribed for) them, will be blamed among virtuous men.
