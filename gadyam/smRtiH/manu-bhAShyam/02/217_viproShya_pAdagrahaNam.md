Having returned from a journey, he should clasp her feet—‘the left foot
by the left hand, etc.’ (Verse 72).

‘*Daily*’—every day.

‘*Salute her*’—on the ground.

‘*Righteous*’—Cultured. Bearing in mind that such is this duty of
cultured men.—(217)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 301) as laying down
how the young student is to behave to towards the Teacher’s wife.

The first half of the verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
451) as showing that ‘*pādagrahaṇa*’ (clasping of the feet) is distinct
from *abhivādana* (saluting);—and again on p. 462 the entire verse is
quoted along with the preceding verse.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 104).
