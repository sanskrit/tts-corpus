The Brāhmaṇa who knows not the return-greeting of the greeting of salutation does not deserve to be saluted by the learned; he is exactly as the śūdra is.—(126)

*Objection*.—“It would have sufficed to say ‘he who knows not the
return-greeting’; the addition of the phrase ‘of the greeting of
salutation’ is superfluous and not quite compatible.”

It is not so; the construction is—‘the return-greeting *in keeping with
the* greeting of salutation.’ For instance, propriety demands that (*a*)
if the salutation has been offered with the name of the accoster duly
pronounced, then in the return-greeting, the final vowel of the name
Should be pronounced ultra-long; (*b*) and he who salutes with the form
‘It is I, Oh, Sir,’ is to be answered without his name being uttered and
without the elongation of any vowel.

‘*Does not deserve to be saluted*’;—this prohibits the uttering of the
words of greeting; the sense being that ‘salutation may be offered,’ but
not with the words ‘it is I, Sir,’—the circumstances under which these
words are to be used h aving been shown before (under 123).

‘*As the Śūdra*,’—this appears to be by way of illustration; for as a
matter of fact the Śūdra also, when of great age, is held to be
deserving of salutation.

‘*By the learned*’;—this has been added only for the purpose of filling
up the metre.—(126)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 450), where the
following explanation is added:—The meaning is that the man who does not
know the return greeting in strict consonance with rules of salutation
does not deserve to be greeted at all, the correct form of the response
being as laid down in the preceding verse—the ultra-elongation of the
vowel at the end of the name pronounced by the saluter in the formula of
salutation. What is prohibited here is only that salutation which is
accompanied by the formula containing the saluter’s name; that all
salutation is not entirely interdicted is indicated by the words ‘he is
exactly as the Śūdra is’;—the Śūdra also, when over ninety years of age,
is deserving of salutation, according to Manu 2. 137. The word
‘*pratyabhivādanam*’ means the pronouncing, by the elder who has been
saluted, of benediction with prescribed formula.

This verse is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 28), which adds a
verse from Yama to the effect that the Brāhmaṇa who, on being saluted,
does not return the proper benediction, is born as a tree in the
crematorium, inhabited by crows and vultures.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 297) as laying down that no
salutation should be offered to one ignorant of the proper form of the
response to it;—in *Nityāchārapradīpa* (p. 407);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 57);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 98).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (13.14).—‘He should simply say *Here I am*, when saluting one
who knows not the form of the return-greeting.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 465).—‘On being saluted, if one does
not offer his blessing, a part of the saluter’s sins falls upon the
person saluted. To the Brāhmaṇa he should say *svasti* (all may be
well), to the Kṣatriya *āyuṣyam* (long-life), to the Vaiśya *vardhatām*
(may you prosper), to the Śūdra *ārogyam* (freedom from disease).’

\[Yama also reproduces Manu’s Verse.\]

*Bhaviṣya-purāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 298).—‘On bring saluted, if one
does not return the salutation, or if one does not pronounce the
blessing, one falls into many hells.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra* (7.42).—‘*Welfare, Freedom from* *Distemper* ,
*Freedom from Loss* and *Freedom from Disease*, the asking of these
constitutes the return-greeting; the last being for the Śūdra.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.14.26-29).—‘One should ask one who is not
senior, also one of the same age, about his *welfare*; the Kṣatriya
about his *freedom from distemper*;—the Vaiśya about *freedom from
loss*;—the Śūdra about *freedom from disease*.’

126	A Brahmana who does not know the form of returning a salutation, must not be saluted by a learned man; as a Sudra, even so is he.
