One since whose birth ten years have elapsed is ‘of ten years.’ The
*time* is the *determining* and the *Brāhmaṇa* the *determined* factor;
but it is not possible to determine, by means of *time*, either his
tallness or shortness or thinness, etc.; what can be determined by it is
only a certain act of his; and this act can only be that of *maintaining
his life-breath*, which subsists in him continuously since his birth.

The same explanation applies to the epithet ‘*of a* *hundred years*.’

They should be looked upon as ‘father and son.’

‘*Of the two*’—as compared with each other,—’ *the Brāhmaṇa is the
father*.’

All that this means is that even when the Kṣatriya is very old and the
Brāhmaṇa very young in years, the former should rise to meet and salute
the latter.—(135)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 474), as showing
that the Brāhmaṇa is ‘superior’ to all.

It quotes the same verse as contained in *Bhaviṣyapurāṇa*.—. It is
quoted also in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 44b);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 101) to the effect that as between a
*Brāhmaṇa* and a *Kṣatriya*, the former is to be saluted by the latter,
even though he be very much junior in age.

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.14.25)—(a paraphrase of Manu).

*Viṣṇu-Smṛti* (32.17)—(reproduces the exact words of Manu).

*Bhaviṣya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 474)—(has the verse of
Manu, to which it adds another verse to the effect that)—‘the Brāhmaṇa
has thus been declared by the wise the Kṣatriya’s father, the Vaiśya’s
grand-father and the Śūdra’s great-grand-father.’

*Śātātapa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, pp. 473-474).—‘Agni is the superior
of the Twice-born men, the Brāhmaṇa is the superior of all castes.’

*Śātātapa* (Parāśaramāḍhava, p. 299).—‘The Kṣatriya and the rest should
never be saluted by the Brāhmaṇa, even though they be endowed with
knowledge and of good conduct and very learned.’

*Mahābhārata* (13.8.21).—‘The Kṣatriya, hundred years old and the
Brāhmaṇa, ten years old, should he regarded as father and son; of the
two, the Brāhmaṇa being the superior.’

135	Know that a Brahmana of ten years and Kshatriya of a hundred years stand to each other in the relation of father and son; but between those two the Brahmana is the father.
