As the eunuch is useless among women, as the cow is useless among cows, as a gift to the ignorant person is useless, even so is the Bbrāhmaṇa useless who is devoid of the Veda.—(158)

‘*Eunuch*’—he who is without masculine virility, having both (male and
female) signs and incapable of intercourse with women,—just as this
person is ‘*useless women*’;—as again is ‘*the cow useless among
cows*’;—‘*even so is the Brāhmaṇa useless who is devoid of the
Veda*,’—*i.e*., who does not learn.—(158)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 511) as
deprecating ignorance of the Veda;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
129) to the effect that all acts are futile for one who is ignorant of
the Veda.

*Parāśara-smṛti* (Prā. 8-18).—(Reproduces Manu with a slight verbal
variation.)

*Vyāsa* (*Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra*, p. 511).—‘For one who is devoid of
the Veda, all actions are futile.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Do,).—‘One bereft of the Veda is not a Brāhmaṇa.’

*Hārīta* (Do., p. 512).—‘The Veda is what should be learnt by the
Brāhmaṇa.’

*Mahāhhārata*, 12.36.47.—(First half the same as Manu)—‘as the bird is
without wings, so is the Brāhmaṇa devoid of *Mantras*.’

158	As a eunuch is unproductive with women, as a cow with a cow is unprolific, and as a gift made to an ignorant man yields no reward, even so is a Brahmana useless, who (does) not (know) the Rikas.
