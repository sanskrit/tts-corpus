When about to study, he shall be taught with his face to the north, when he has sipped water according to law, has formed the Brahmāñjali (with his hands), wears light clothing and has the organs under full control.—(70)

The Future ending (in ‘*adhyīṣyamāṇaḥ*’) denotes the immediate future;
and means ‘when engaging in study,’ ‘when beginning to study,’ ‘when
desiring to proceed with his study.’

‘*He* *shall be* *taught*, *with hist face* *to* *the north*.’—Gautama
(1.65) has laid down that ‘the pupil should face the east, while the
Teacher faces the west.’

‘*When he has sipped water according to law*’—refers to the rules
prescribed above regarding the sipping of water.

The compound ‘*brahmāñjalikṛtaḥ*’ is to be expounded as ‘he by whom
Brahmāñjali has been formed.’ the past participal adjective
(‘*kṛtaḥ*’)being placed at the end, according to Pāṇini 2.2.37;—the
present compound being analogous to such compounds as ‘*āhitāgni*’ and
the like. Or, we may read ‘*brahmāñjalikṛt*.’

‘*Wears light clothing*’;—*i.e*., with clothes thoroughly washed; a
thorough washing always makes the cloth ‘light’; hence ‘lightness’
indicates *cleanliness*. Or, ‘light clothing’ may be taken in its
literal sense, the lightness of the clothing being meant to serve a
visible purpose: if the boy were

Heavily clad in thick woolen clothes, he would not feel the strokes of
the rope with which he would be struck when found to be inattentive, and
not feeling the stroke, he would not study in the proper manner; and if
the teacher, on this account, found it necessary to remove the cloth
from the back (each time that the rope would be laid on the back), this
would tire the teacher himself; and further, if the boy were struck with
the rope on the naked body, he, would feel great pain.

‘*One who has his organs under full control*’;—*i.e*., one who has fully
subdued all bis organs, both external and internal. The sense is that he
should not turn his eyes this way and that, should not listen to
anything and everything that may be talked of, he should devote all his
attention to his own study.—(70)

‘*Laghuvāsāḥ*’—Lightly cothed,—clothed with washed, and hence light,
dress’ (Medhātithi);—‘with clean clothes (Kullūka);—‘clothed in dress
which is not gorgeous, *i. e*. which is less valuable than the
Teacher’s’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta*, (p. 521); in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 99);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 523), which having adopted
the reading *prā?listu kṛtāpośo* for *???likṛto'dhvāpyo* explains that
the presence of the two words ‘*āchāntaḥ*’ and ‘*kṛtāpośo*’—both of
which denote *ācamana*—makes it clear that the *ācamana* is to be done
twice.

Burnell refers to Ch. XV of *Prātiśākhya* of the Ṛgveda.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (*Saṃskāra*, p. 136), which
notes that this ‘*ācamana*’ forms part of the act of *Reading*;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 50) which has the same note;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 315);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p.
47a).

*Kāmandaka* (2. 22-23).—‘The duties of the Religious Student are—to live
in the house of his preceptor, to tend the sacred fires, to study the
Veda and its auxiliaries, to observe vows, to perform ablutions three
times, to beg alms, and live with the teacher all his life In the
absence of the preceptor, he may live with the preceptor’s son, or with
one of his fellow-students;—or if he likes, he may adopt another mode of
life.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 1. 52, 54, 60.—‘Touching the organs with
Kuśa-grass;—permitted by the teacher, he should sit to the right of the
teacher, facing the East or the North; touching the teacher’s left foot,
with his hand, be should address the request to the teacher, saving
“*Please sir, teach*.”

*Śaṅkha-Smṛti*, 3. 5.—‘Being permitted by the teacher, one should begin
reading, adopting the *Brahmāñjali* attitude, respectfully looking on
the teacher’s face.’

*Laghu-Vyāsa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 524).—‘He who reads a verse,
or a half or a quarter of it, without the teacher’s permission, is a
*stealer of Veda*, and falls into hell.’
