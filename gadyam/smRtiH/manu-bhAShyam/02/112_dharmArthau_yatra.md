Where merit and wealth are not possible, nor is there an adequate desire to serve, there knowledge should not be imparted; just as healthy seed (is not sown) on barren land.—(112)

It has been said above (in 109) that ‘these ten should be taught for the
sake of merit ’; of that same injunction the present verse supplies a
brief reiteration; it does not prescribe anything new, being merely
elucidatory of the preceding injunction.

‘*Wealth*’ should be taken as standing for *benefit* of all kinds; since
the preceding verse has spoken of teaching by way of exchange of
knowledge also.

‘*Adequate*’;—*i.e*., commensurate with the teaching; there being much
service it the teaching is much; and little service if the teaching is
little.

‘*There knowledge*’;—the term ‘knowledge,’ ‘*vidyā*,’ stands for that
*by means of which all things are known; i.e*., the reading of the text
as well as the grasping of the meaning. The meaning is that he who does
not bring any benefit should not be taught the text of the Veda, nor
should the explanation of tho meaning of Vedic texts be expounded to
him.

‘*Ūṣara*’—stands for that plot of land where, on account of the defects
in the soil, seeds do not sprout.

‘*Healthy*’;—corn-seeds of good variety are sown with the help of the
plough, etc. Similarly knowledge also bears excellent fruits when sown
(imparted) on good soil.

It should not be thought that, when one imparts knowledge when paid for
it, it becomes a case of mere barter; because the action (of teaching)
is not preceded by any bargaining as regards the price to be paid, such
as—‘if you give me such and such an amount, I shall impart to you such
an amount of teaching’; while such bargain is the necessary condition of
all ‘barter’; and the mere conferment of the slightest benefit does not
constitute ‘barter.’

Though verse 215 below says that ‘one should not confer any benefit upon
the teacher previously,’—yet this does not quite prohibit the previous
conferring of benefits; it is merely supplementary to the injunction
that ‘when the pupil is going to take the Final Bath, he should, when
asked to do so, bring for his Teacher all that may lie within his
power’; and it is not an independent statement by itself.—(112)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 515), among texts
laying down the Teacher’s duties;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 523), as
mentioning those who should not be taught;—in *Madanapārjāta* (p. 103)
as mentioning certain persons not fit for teaching;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 51);—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 312), which explains the meaning to
be that ‘there is no merit in teaching a heretic who neglects the
prescribed duties’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 140).

**(Verses 112-113)  
**

*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra* (2.4.9).—‘Where merit and wealth are not
possible, nor is there an adequate desire to serve, there one may rather
perish with his learning, than sow it on barren soil.’

*Viṣṇu-Smṛti* (29.8).—(reproduces the words of Manu 112).

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 516).—‘Where there is no merit or
wealth, nor desire to serve nor clxance of riches,—there one may perish
along with his learning; he should never sow it on barren soil.’

112	Where merit and wealth are not (obtained by teaching) nor (at least) due obedience, in such (soil) sacred knowledge must not be sown, just as good seed (must) not (be thrown) on barren land.
