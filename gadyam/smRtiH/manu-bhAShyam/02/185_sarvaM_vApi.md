‘*All the aforesaid*’—*i.e., those not devoid of the Veda and
sacrifices* and so forth—‘*being* *unavailable*’;—‘*wander over the
whole village*’;—he may go over the whole village, irrespectively of
caste and other distinctions, for the purpose of obtaining his means of
subsistence. Only ‘*he should avoid persons of ill-repute*’—*i.e*.,
those who are known to have committed serious sins, even though they may
never have been seen to commit them; Says Gautama (2-35)—‘The begging of
alms may be done from all castes, save the disreputable and the fallen.’

‘*Having his speech well-controlled*’;—*i.e*., till he obtains the alms,
he should not utter any words save those used in the actual
begging.—(186)

This verse is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 60), which adds that the
prohibition of the ‘*abhiśasṭa*’ naturally implies that of the
‘*patita*’ ‘outcast’, also;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra p. 110),
which says that this does not sanction begging from a *Śūdra*.

*Gautama* (2.42).—‘Food should be begged from all castes, except from
the outcasts and persons of ill-repute.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.3.25).—‘Pot in hand, one should beg for food
from qualified Brāhmaṇas, excepting the Teacher’s house; and avoiding
those unfit and of ill-repute.’

*Bhaviṣya Purāṇa* (see under 183).

*Aṅgiras* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 453).—‘From the Śūdra he shall accept
only raw food, that also just enough for one night.’

185	Or, if there are no (virtuous men of the kind) mentioned above, he may go to each (house in the) village, being pure and remaining silent; but let him avoid Abhisastas (those accused of mortal sin).
