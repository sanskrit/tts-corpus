<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The *repeating* of the Text for the purpose of getting it up, which
comes up as supplementary to the subject-matter of the context, is here
re-iterated for the purpose of eulogising it, and not for enjoining it
again.

The term ‘*constantly*’ refers to the time of study only.

The term ‘*tapas*,’ ‘*piety*,’ stands for fasting and such other bodily
mortifications; but in the present context it denotes figuratively that
spiritual faculty produced by the mortifications which consists in the
capacity to grant boons and pronounce curses.—‘*Tapasyan*’ stands for
‘desiring to acquire’ the said *piety* by means of bodily
mortifications; the root (in ‘*tapasyan*’) denoting the bodily
sufferings undergone in the process of *acquiring*. The *Parasmaipada*
ending (in ‘*tapasyan*’) is justified on the ground that the participle
is not intended to have the force of the reflexive-passive (in which
case alone the Ātmanepada ending would be necessary, by Pāṇini’s Sūtra
3.1.88).

The second half of the verse is a recommendatory reiteration, supplying
the reason for what lias been asserted in the first half.

Whatever ‘penance’ there is on the Earth, the ‘repeating of Veda’ is
superior to all. This is meant to eulogise the act as leading to results
similar to those brought about by all the austerities.—(166)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 307) as eulogising
Vedic study;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 509);—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 128), to the effect that ‘Vedic study’ forms the best
‘austerity—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 46 b).
