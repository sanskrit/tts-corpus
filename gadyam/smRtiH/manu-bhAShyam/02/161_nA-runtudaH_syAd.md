Even though pained, one should not (use such words as) cut to the quick; he should not do, or think of, injury to others; he should not utter words by which others are pained, and which (therefore) will obstruct his passage to (higher) regions.—(161)

This is another duty laid down for man in relation to ordinary life.

‘*Aruntadaḥ* (?)’ means *that* *which* *cuts—‘tudati*’—*the ritats*
(?)—‘*arūṃṣi*’; *i.e*., affecting the vitals;—he who utters such
words—*i.e*., such words of chiding as are extremely painful,—is called
‘*aruntudaḥ*.’

‘*Pained*’;—even though pain may have been indicted on him by the other
person, he should not utter unpleasant words.

Similarly ‘*injury to others*’ is ‘*harming others*’; and one should not
do an act conducive to it; nor should he think of it.

Or, ‘*paradrohakarmadhīḥ*’ may he taken to mean ‘think of doing injury
to others.’

Such words by which—even though uttered in joke—other persons are
pained—one should not utter.

Even a part of the sentence uttered by one should not he so
disagreeable; for even portions of sentences may become indicative of
unpleasant notions, through the force of their meaning, the particular
context (occasion) and so forth.

One should not utter such words as they are ‘*alokyā*,’—*i.e*.,
obstructing his passage to the heavenly regions.

Compare with this, Mahābhārata (13.104-31)—Vidura’s advice to
Duryodhana—

161	Let him not, even though in pain, (speak words) cutting (others) to the quick; let him not injure others in thought or deed; let him not utter speeches which make (others) afraid of him, since that will prevent him from gaining heaven.
