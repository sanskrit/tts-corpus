It is said that that twice-born man, who, even though garlanded, recites the Veda daily to the best of his capacity, undergoes the highest penance to his very nail-tips.—(167)

This is another commendatory statement pertaining to the injunction of
Vedic Study contained in the Vājasaneya-Brāhmaṇa.

The construction is—‘*ā* *nakhāgrebhya eva*.’

‘*Ha*’ denotes *hearsay*.

The term ‘*highest*’ having already signified the high character of the
penance, the phrase ‘*to his very nail-tips*’ h as been added with a
view to expressing the fact that the penance intended is higher even
than the highest; the sense being that even though the nail-tips are
insensible, yet they also are affected by the penance; the *Kṛcchra* and
other penances, not pervading over tho nail-tips, are not productive of
all that is desirable; but the penance in question reaches even those
tips. This is the special praise bestowed upon the penance.

‘*Tapyate tapaḥ*’;—tbe augment ‘*yak*’ and the *Ātma* *nepada* ending
are in accordance with Pāṇini 3.1.88, by which the root ‘*tap*’ takes
the said augment and ending, when governing the noun ‘*tapas*.’

‘*Even though garlanded*.’—One who wears a garland is called
‘garlanded,’ *i.e*., the man who wears a string of flowers.

This epithet indicates the renouncing of the restraints imposed upon the
Religious Student. The meaning is that, even if one were to renounce the
duties of the Religious Student, and yet recite the Veda ‘*to the heat
of his capacity*,’—as much as he can do, even though that be
little,—‘*daily*’—every day,—he becomes endowed with excellent success.

This is mere praise; it does not moan that one should read the Veda
after renouncing the restraints.—(107)

*Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa*, 11. 5. 7. 4.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 509), which adds
the following explanatory notes:—The meaning is that the man who, even
though wearing the garland,—*i.e*. though not observing the rules and
restrictions strictly,—sedulously carries on Vedic study, carries on
excellent austerity ‘to the very fingertips—the particle ‘*ha*’
indicates that the fact stated is universally recognised. Thus the sense
is that “when Vedic study, carried on without strict adherence to the
rules, is conducive to excellent results,—what to say of it, when done
in strict accordance with the rules.”

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 69), which gives the *Anvaya*
as—‘*ānakhāgrebhyaḥ tapastapyate ha*’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 128), which explains the meaning as one who studies the Veda to the
best of his capacity performs the ‘highest austerity, to the very
finger-tips it adds the notes—‘*ha*’ indicates that what is stated here
is well-known,—‘*sragvī*’, wearing a garland, *i.e*. even though not
strictly observing the restraints and observances.

*Baudhāyana* (2. 2. 1).—‘Always wearing the Sacred Thread, always
reading the Veda...... the Brāhmaṇa falls not from the Brāhmic regions.’

*Smṛtisārasamuccaya* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 510).—‘He who hears the
Veda in his body is never touched by sin.’

*Vyāsa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 512).—‘Just as fire burns even wet
trees, so does one knowing the Veda burn all the evil in one’s self.’

167	Verily, that twice-born man performs the highest austerity up to the extremities of his nails, who, though wearing a garland, daily recites the Veda in private to the utmost of his ability.
