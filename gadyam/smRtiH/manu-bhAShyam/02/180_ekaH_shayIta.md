‘*He should always sleep alone*; *nowhere should he allove his manhood
to run out*,’—*i.e*., not even outside; intercourse with women having
been already prohibited.

Next follows a commendatory statement—‘*Intentionally, etc*.’
‘*Intention*’ means *wish*...... By allowing his manhood to run—by any
means—he ‘*breaks*’—destroys—‘*his* *vow*’ of studentship
(continence).—(180)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 39), which explains
‘*Vratam*’ as ‘*brahmacharyam*’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
496);—only the first half in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 456);—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 46b);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 127), which explains ‘*vratam*’ as the vow of
Studentship;—unintentional emission involves only an expiation, and not
a breach of the vow.

*Viṣṇu* (28.48).—‘Those Vedic Scholars who know Dharma have declared
that in the case of the Brāhmaṇa under vow of studentship, intentional
emission is a transgression.’

*Gobhila Gṛhyasūtra* (2.26).—‘He should avoid giving vent to his organ.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 496).—‘Sitting and sleeping on a
couch and teeth-cleansing should be avoided; he should sleep alone, on
kuśa-grass, and should never emit his semen anywhere.’

180	Let him always sleep alone, let him never waste his manhood; for he who voluntarily wastes his manhood, breaks his vow.
