He who, untired, recites this, day after day, for three years, turns into air, and becoming transfigured into Ākāśa, reaches the supreme brahman.—(82)

आकाश इव सर्वव्यापी विभुः संपद्यते, **खमूर्तिः** खस्वभाववान् भवति । न तु मूर्तिः शरीरम्, आकाशस्य शरीराभावात् । अथ किम् इदं ब्रह्म, यद् रूपापत्तिर् उच्यते । परमात्मानन्दरूपः, यस्येमे क्षेत्रज्ञाः पवनजवोद्धतस्य वारिराशेर् इवोर्मयः । ते यथा प्रशान्तावस्थे तस्मिंस् तद्रूपा भवन्ति । एवम् अमी तद्रूपा आत्मानः संपद्यन्ते । विशेषतश् च सर्वम् एतद् द्वादशे वक्ष्यते । अध्ययनम् इदं गायत्र्याश् चोदितं न जपो, न चावृत्तिगणनास्ति । **अतन्द्रित** इतिवचनाद् बहुकृत्वः करणं प्रतीयते । सकृत्प्रयोगे हि नास्ति तन्द्राशङ्का । मोक्षार्थिनो ऽयं विधिः ॥ २.८२ ॥

He becomes omnipresent, all-pervading, like *Ākāśa*.

‘*Transfigured into Ākāśa*’—means that he acquires the nature of Ākāśa.
‘*Mūrti*,’ ‘Figure,’ does not stand here for the *Body*; as Ākāśa has no
‘body’ at all.

“What is this ‘*Brahman*’ into whose form the man is said to become
merged?”

It is the Supreme Soul, of the nature of Bliss; He of whom all these
embodied souls are mere inodes, just as waves are of the ocean perturbed
by the force of wind. And just as when the ocean becomes calm, the waves
become merged into it, in the same manner the embodied souls become
transformed and merged into the Supreme Soul. All this is going to be
described in detail in Discourse 12.

What is enjoined in the present context is the mere reciting and study
of the *Gāyatrī* verse, not its *Japa*, repetition; this is shown by the
fact that the number of repetitions is not stated.

‘*Untired*’;—this denotes that the recitation is to be carried out again
and again; as a single recitation can never tire a person.

What is enjoined here pertains to persons seeking for Final
Release.—(82)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āḥnika, p. 321), which supplies
the following explanatory notes:—

‘*Vāyubhūtaḥ*’—as quick- moving as the wind, or ‘encased in the Subtle
Body’—as explained in *Kalpataru*;—‘*Khamūrtimān*’—becoming as
all-pervading as the *Ākāśa*, becomes the Supreme Self.,

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 286) as eulogising the
*japa* of the *Gāyatrī mantra*;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 236).
