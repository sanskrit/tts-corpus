Through censure one becomes an ass, and the defamer becomes a dog; he who lives on him becomes a worm, and he who is jealous becomes an insect.—(201)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is a statement commendatory of what has been enjoined in the
foregoing verses. Hence it has to be explained as follows:—

‘*Through cenmre*’;—*i.e*., by listening to the censuring of his
Teacher—‘*one becomes an ass*’; the ablative being taken either as
denoting *cause*, or as having the force of the participle; *parīvādāt*
being construed as ‘*parīvādam śrutvā*,’ ‘having listened to censuring.’

‘*Defamer*,’—the person listening to defamation is figuratively called
‘defamer just as one preparing meat has been called the ‘Killer’ of the
animal. As for the act of defaming itself, the prohibition of this
becomes naturally implied by the prohibition of hearing it.

‘*One who lives upon*’;—he who supports himself on what he receives from
his Teacher; or one who behaves ill-mannerly towards him.

‘*One who is jealous*’;—who does not brook the rise and advancement of
his Teacher and burns within (at its sight).

The two latter have not been spoken of before this; hence what is said
in regard to these is to be regarded as direct injunction.

‘*Parīvāda*’ and ‘*parivāda*,’ both forms—with long as well as with the
short *ī*—are correct, according to Pāṇini, 6.3.122.—(201)

‘*Paribhoktā*’—‘He who lives upon the Teacher’ (Medhātithi);—‘he who
eats, without the Teacher’s permission, the best food obtained by
begging’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

The verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 107) where ‘*paribhoktā*’ is
explained as ‘one who makes use of the Teacher’s wealth, without his
permission’;—also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 491), which also
explains ‘*paribhoktā*’ as ‘one who lives upon the Teacher’s property,
without his permission.’

*Medhātithi* (P. 169,1. 16)—‘*Samskartā...ghātakaḥ*’—This is a clear
reference to Manu 5.51—

> anumantā viśasitā nihantā krayavikrayī \|  
> saṃskartā copahartā ca khādakaśceti ghātakāḥ \|\|

This verse is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 42), which explains
‘*paribhoktā*’ as one who eats food without presenting it to the
Teacher;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 120) as forbidding the
decrying of the Teacher by the Pupil himself; it explains ‘*paribhoktā*’
as ‘one who makes use of the Teacher’s property without his permission.’

201	By censuring (his teacher), though justly, he will become (in his next birth) an ass, by falsely defaming him, a dog; he who lives on his teacher's substance, will become a worm, and he who is envious (of his merit), a (larger) insect.
