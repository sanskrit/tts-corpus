The ignorant person is verily a “child,” while the imparted of mantras is the “father.” They have called the ignorant man “child,” and the imparter of mantras, “father.”—(153)

It is not by reason of his younger age that one is known as ‘child’ it
is the ‘*ignorant*’—uneducated person—who, even though old in age, is
called ‘child.’

‘*Importer of mantras*’—is used figuratively; the sense being that ‘he
who *imparts*,—*i.e*., teaches and expounds,—*the Mantras—i.e*., the
Vedas—becomes the father.’

The particle ‘*vai*,’ ‘verily,’ indicates the support of other
scriptures; and these scriptures (thus referred to) must have been
regarded by the said gods as ancient and authoritative. Hence it is that
we have the term ‘*they have called*.’ which points to a traditional
belief.

‘*The ignorant*’—uneducated—‘*person*,’—‘*they*’—*i.e*., even the
ancients—have called ‘*child*’; —*and* ‘*the importer of mantras, the
father*.’ The particle ‘*iti*,’ occurring after the term ‘*bāla*,’
points to the exact form of the traditional belief;—the construction
being—‘*ajñam bāla iti etena śabdena āhuḥ*,’ ‘the ignorant person they
have called by the name *child*.’ It is on account of the presence of
this ‘*iti*’ that the accusative ending is absent in the term ‘*bāla*.’

This story about the child (Āṅgirasa) occurs in the Chāndogya, and the
author of the *Smṛti* (Manu) has reproduced it here only in sense.—(153)

153	'For (a man) destitute of (sacred) knowledge is indeed a child, and he who teaches him the Veda is his father; for (the sages) have always said "child" to an ignorant man, and "father" to a teacher of the Veda.'
