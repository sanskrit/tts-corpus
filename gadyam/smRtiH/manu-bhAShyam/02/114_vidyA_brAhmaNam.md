Learning having approached the Brāhmaṇa said to him—“I am thy wealth, guard me; impart me not unto a scorner; thus may I become extremely powerful.”—(114)

‘*Learning*’—in an embodied form, having approached a certain teacher,
said to him.

‘*I am thy wealth*’—treasure —‘*guard me*.’

The question arising as to what would the ‘guarding of Learning,—it is
added—‘*Impart me not unto the*’—one who talks ill of, who despises.
That is, never teach a scorner.

‘*Thus may I become extremely powerful*.’—I shall be extremely useful to
you. ‘*Vīrya*’, ‘*power*,’ here stands for great efficiency in
accomplishing what is useful.

The insertion of the cerebral ‘in the phrase ‘*śevadhiṣṭe* *smi*’ is an
imitation of a Vedic form.—(l14)

This verse is an adaptation of a very much older text. *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 515) quotes this latter text as ‘śruti’—

> vidyā ha vai brāhmaṇamājagām  
> gopāya māṃ śevadhiṣṭe'hamasmi \|  
> asūyakāyānṛjave apatāya  
> nā mām brūyāt avīryavatī tathā syām \|\|

Burnell and Hopkins remark as follows:—“This with verse 144, which
appears to have originally followed these verses as a whole, constitutes
a favourite saying of the Brāhmaṇas. These verses in an older form are
quoted in the Nirukta (ii-4), and (more like this present text) they
occur also in the *Viṣṇu* and *Vaśiṣṭha Smṛtis* s they also occur in
*Saṃhitopaniṣad-brāhmaṇa* of the Sāmaveda (pp. 29-30). The older form of
these two verses 114 and 115 (as well as 144) was in the *Tṛṣṭup* metre,
as in the Smṛtis just referred to.”

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 103)—where the Amarakoṣa is
quoted as explaining ‘*Śevadhi*’ as ‘*nidhi*,’ ‘treasure and ‘*asūyā*’
is defined as ‘tendency to fault-finding.’

It is quoted also in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 523).

**(Verse 114-115)**

Viṣṇu-Smṛti (29.9-10),  
Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti (2.14-15).  
These authorities, along with Manu, paraphrase the text which is found
in Nirukta-Naigama Kāṇḍa, 2.4.

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, pp. 514-515).—‘One who teaches
the Vedas, the Dharma, the Purāṇas and the subsidiary sciences to one
who is endowed with character and is self-controlled and is ever
attentive.’
