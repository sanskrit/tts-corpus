‘*One-eyed*’—he who is deprived of one of his eyes.

‘*Lame*’—who is without one leg.

‘*Something else like this*’—*e.g*., a cripple, flat-nosed and so forth.

‘*Even truly*’;—the term ‘*even*’ implies the false defamation also,
*i.e*., when one who is not one-eyed is called so.

The fine in this case shall be ‘*at least one Kārṣāpaṇa*’—*i.e*., if,
through mercy, the lowest fine be meant to be imposed, a *Kārṣāpaṇa*
should be the lowest amount of it. Otherwise, the flue should be two,
three, four or five *Kārṣāpaṇas*, according to the character of the
accused.

This rule may be taken, as before, as referring to either all men, or to
the *Śūdra* only.—(274)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.204), which notes that this rule
refers to a case where the defamer is a very wicked person; and
*Bālambhaṭṭī* has the following notes:—‘*Tathyena*,’ even in
truth,—‘*kārṣāpaṇāvaram*,’ at least one *kārṣāpaṇa*, never less than
that; this refers to cases where a wicked and ill-behaved person insults
a caste-fellow.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 806), which adds that this refers to a
case where the insulter is a man with very superior qualifications, or
where the motive of insulting is very insignificant.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 247), which explains
‘*kārṣāpaṇāvaram*’ as ‘that than which one *kārṣā* *paṇa* is lower,’
*i.e*., ‘two *kārṣāpaṇas*—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 295),
which adds that this refers to an extremely wicked person;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 44b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
150a).

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 103).—‘If one reviles a man as one-eyed, lame and so
forth when he is really so,—the fine is 3 *Paṇas*; if he is not so, it
is 6 *Paṇas*.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.27).—‘If a man is blind, with one eye, or lame, or defective
in any similar way,—and another calls him so,—the latter shall be fined
2 *kārṣāpāṇas*, though he speaks the truth.’

*Yājñavalkya*( 2-204).—‘If a man reviles another—either falsely or truly
or ironically—in regard to defective limbs or sense-organs or
diseases,—he shall he fined twelve and a half *Paṇas*.’

*Nārada* (15-16.18).—(Same as Manu.)
