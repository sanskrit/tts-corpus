Just as the hunter discovers the foot-print of the deer by the drops of blood, so should the king discover the right by means of inference.—(11)

It has been said above that the king himself shall not, in a hurry
either haul anyone up or punish him for any offence; and the reason for
this lies in the consideration that it is quite possible that the act
that the king regards as an ‘offence’ might have been done in joke. Now
the question arises—how is it to be ascertained whether the act has been
done in joke or through malice and such other causes?

It is in answer to this question that it is said that ‘this is to be
ascertained by means of inference.’—Just as the
‘*hunter*’—fowler—‘*discovers*’—gets at—‘*the foot-print*’ of the deer
that has been wounded and disappeared from view by means of the drops of
blood flowing from the wound,—in the same manner the king should
discover the root-cause of the suit—which may be not perceptible,—by
means of inference.

The term ‘*dharma*,’ ‘*right*,’ here stands for *the real facts of the
case*.

The restriction of ‘inference’ as a means of finding out truth, already
mentioned before (in verse 3), is for the purpose of emphasising the
point.—(44)

*Cf*. 12.104; also the *Mahābhārata* 12.132.21.

‘*Padam*’—‘Footsteps’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja)—and ‘lair’ (Kullūka
and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in, *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 30);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 56);—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (5a).

*Gautama* (11.23-24).—‘Reasoning is a means of getting at the truth;
coming to a conclusion through that, he shall decide properly.’

after having ascertained the truth by inference, ordeals and the like.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (16.4-5).—‘Let him reason properly regarding an offence;
finally the offence will become evident thereby.’

*Nārada* (1.38).—‘As a huntsman traces the vestiges of a wounded deer in
a thicket by the drops of blood, even so let the King trace justice.’

Do. (1.40).—‘When it is impossible to act up to the precepts of sacred
law, it becomes necessary to adopt a method founded on reasoning.’

understandings of other persons, in the deciding of the highest, lowest
and middling disputes.’

leads to another through the blood-mark, so oven shall the King trace
the steps of justice.’

044	As a hunter traces the lair of a (wounded) deer by the drops of blood, even so the king shall discover on which side the right lies, by inferences (from the facts).
