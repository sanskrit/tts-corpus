Fifteen days and nights make a ‘*fortnight*’; the aggregate of three
fortnights is called ‘*tripakṣam*’; according to Pāṇini 2.4.17, the
compound should have a feminine ending, but this is precluded by the
exception that follows, regarding ‘*pātra*’ and other words (which
include the word ‘*pakṣa*’ also).

“In that case the feminine form ‘*tripakṣī*’ should be impossible.”

The wrong gender in that case is to be regarded as a ‘Vedic anomaly.’

The Ablative ending in ‘*tripakṣāt*’ has the force of the participial
affix ‘*lyap*.’

The meaning of the verse thus is that—‘He who after *having waited for*
three fortnights, dees not give evidence, without being ill, should hear
the burden of that debt’;—‘as also the tenth part out of it, as a
penalty.’

‘*Debts and other mailers*’;—the addition of the phrase ‘and other
matters’ indicates that what is said here applies to all kinds of suits;
and the repetition of the term ‘debt’ is only by way of illustration.
The meaning is that—‘in a suit where for the said time no evidence is
given, the burden of the defeated party is to be borne by the
witnesses.’

‘*Gada*,’ ‘*illness*,’ is meant to indicate other kinds of disability
also; so that due cognizance should be taken of such conditions also as
family troubles, fear of creditor and so forth.

The term ‘*bandha*’ following a numeral word, denotes *penalty*, and
stands for the ‘tenth part.’

The terms ‘*naraḥ*’ and ‘*sarvataḥ*’ are added only for filling up the
metre.

Others explain that the assertion ‘*should hear that debt*’ means that
‘he incurs the sin of stealing the amount of the debt.’

The meaning is that the man shall pay the tenth part of the fine that
would be payable to the king by the defeated party.—(107)

Hopkins again misrepresents Nandana as reading ‘*gatonaraḥ*’ for
‘*Narogadaḥ*.’ It is clear that Hopkins had a very defective manuscript
of Nandana’s commentary.

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (37b);—in *Aparārka* (p. 677),
to the effect that it is only in cases relating to debts and the like
that the absentee witness who is fit to attend, does not attend;—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 2.76) which adds that ‘*agadaḥ*’ stands for freedom from
disease and state or divine oppression;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra,
p. 213), which explains ‘*agadaḥ*’ as ‘in good health,’—‘*tadṛnam*’ as
that which can be proved by means of witnesses;—‘*sarvam*’ as ‘along
with accrued interest,’ and ‘*prāpnuyāt*’ as ‘should be paid’;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 54b) which explains that ‘*agadaḥ*’ stands
for the ‘absence of obstacles arising either from natural causes or from
some action of the king.’

*Gautama* (13.6).—‘If witnesses, on being asked, do not answer, they are
guilty of a crime.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.76).—‘A person not deposing as a witness should be made
to pay, on the forty-sixth day, the entire amount of the debt (involved
in the suit), along with the tenth part of that amount as penalty.’

*Bṛhaspati* (7.31).—‘If a witness, who is not ill, being summoned, does
not make his appearance, he should be made to pay the debt and also a
fine, after the lapse of three fortnights.’

*Nārada* (1.197).—‘He who conceals his knowledge at the time of trial,
although previously he has stated to others what he knows, deserves
specially heavy punishment; for he is more criminal than a false
witness.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.387).—‘The man who, when summoned, does not bear
witness is punishable.’
