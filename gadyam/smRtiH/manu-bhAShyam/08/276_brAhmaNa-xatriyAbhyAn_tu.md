The construction of this passage is elliptical:—‘In the case of mutual
abuse between the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya, this shall be the
punishment.’

Or, the Dative (in ‘*brāhmāṇakṣatriyābhyāṃ*’) may be taken as denoting
*purpose*; the sense being—‘for the purpose of keeping in check the
Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya.’

The punishment here prescribed is to be inflicted when some grievous
offence is attributed, and causes pain—(276)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 255), which adds the
following explanations:—In a case where a Brāhmaṇa and a Kṣatriya have
insulted one another, the ‘first amercement’ on the latter.—According to
*Bālambhaṭṭī* (2.207) the rule refers to cases where the defamation is
in regard to a heinous offence;—It is quoted in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(Calcutta, p. 71), which says that this refers to cases of mutual
defamation between the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya, and adds that the same
law holds good as between the Vaiśya and the Śūdra also-;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 150a).
