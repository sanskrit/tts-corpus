<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Even though the maiden may be willing, if her parents and other
relatives are close hy, and their presence is not heeded by the man who,
*through sheer audacity*, relying upon his force and having the idea
‘who can do anything to me?’—and relying solely upon the maiden’s love
for him—‘*defiles her*,’—the root ‘*kṛ*’ which has many meanings, stands
here for the act *of defiling*, then ‘*his fingers should be clipped
off*’;—or ‘*he should be fined six hundred*.’

Others have held that this verse sums up what has been said (under 361)
regarding the violating of an unwilling maiden, to be punished with
‘death.’ ‘Killing’ in this connection stands for corporal
punishment—beginning with beating and ending with actual killing; and
what the present text means is that if a man defiles a maiden of a low
caste, he shall not be *killed*.—he shall have only his fingers clipped
off.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 321), to the
effect that two fingers are to be cut off if the man only defiles the
maiden with his fingers;—in *Aparārka* (p. 858), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Abhiṣahya*’, forcibly,—‘*kuryāt*,’ defile the maiden
by the introduction of fingers,—the two fingers (its reading being
‘*kartye aṅgulyau*’) with which he defiles her should be cut off at
once, without delay;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 403), which has the
following notes:—‘*Abhiṣahya*,’ insolently,—‘*kuryāt*,’ should
defile,—‘*kalpye*’ (which is its reading for ‘*kartye*’), should be cut
off;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (2.288), to the effect that when a man defiles
an unwilling maiden of the same caste as himself by thrusting his
fingers into her, he should be fined 600 and two of his fingers should
be cut off.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 157a).
