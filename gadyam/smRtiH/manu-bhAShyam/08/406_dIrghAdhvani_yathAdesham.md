For a long passage, the boat-fare should be in propor tion to the time and place; this should be understood to be the rule regarding the banks of rivers; in connection with the sea, there is no fixed rule.—(406)

The toll mentioned in the foregoing verses is to be paid for the
crossing of rivers; what is now declared relates to the passage by boat
from one village to another.

‘*For a long passage*’—*i.e*., in a journey that is measured by miles.

‘*In proportion to the place*’—*i.e*., according to the freight-rates
that may have been fixed by the boatmen of the place concerned.

‘*In proportion to the time*,’—the fare payable during the rains, or
where there is plenty of water, shall he different from that payable in
a river where there is very little water; in the latter case there is
much time taken in going from one village to another, and it involves
more labour on the part of the boatmen,—hence the fare in this case
would he heavier.

The term ‘*tara*,’ which literally means *crossing*, which is the effect
of the *fare* that is paid, has been used here for this latter. The
sense is that the amount of fare payable goes on increasing in
proportion to the distance traversed.

‘*This should be understood to be the rule regarding the banks of
rivers*.’

‘*In regard to the sea, there is no settled rule*’—regarding fares.
Since it cannot be ascertained how many miles the boat has been carried,
according to which the distance and the fare could be computed. In the
case of rivers and lakes, it can be ascertained whether the distance
traversed is one *Yojana* (8 miles) or two; because the villages serve
as the measuring points; so that the fare paid for a journey of two
would ho double of that paid for that of one *Yojana*. In the sea, on
the other hand, the boat can be taken with great difficulty, and
distances also cannot he measured; it is for this reason that it has
been declared that ‘*as regards the sea there is no settled
rule*.’—(406)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 270), which
explains the meaning to be that for voyages by river, the freight, etc.
payable is to be determined by considerations of place and time; and in
the case of voyages *by sea*, there is no such hard and fast rule, the
freight payable being what is agreed upon in each case.

It is quoted in *V* *yavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 263), which has the
following notes:—What has been said in the preceding verse applies to
river-crossings; in the case of long voyages by river the fares are to
be determined by such considerations as whether the river is sluggish or
swift, whether the season is summer or the rains; for voyages by sea, no
rates can be fixed.

406	For a long passage the boat-hire must be proportioned to the places and times; know that this (rule refers) to (passages along) the banks of rivers; at sea there is no settled (freight).
