If the Brāhmaṇa, through the sense of mastery, and out of greed, makes sanctified twice-born persons do fertile work, against their will,—he should be fined by the king six hundred.—(412)

‘*Sanctified*’—those for whom the initiatory rite has been performed.
Though this is already implied by the term ‘*twice-born*’ itself, yet
the additional qualification has been added in order to guard against
this latter word being taken in the sense of all the three castes
promiscuously. The sense of the text is that if a Brāhmaṇa makes fellow
caste-men perform such ‘servile work’ as the washing of feet, the
removing of offal, sweeping and so forth,—‘*against their
will*’;—because he is their master,—*i.e*., possessed of the rights of
the master over them,—‘*he should be fined six hundred*,’— if he does it
‘*through greed*.’ If he does it through hatred and such other motives,
the fine shall be heavier.

The form ‘*prābhavatya*’ is an abstract noun formed from the present
participial term ‘*prabhavan*.’ And since the text speaks of
‘*mastery*,’ which implies the idea of master and servant, there would
be nothing wrong in the preceptor’s menial work being done by the pupil.

‘*Against their will*’—this shows that if they are willing, the fine
shall be very small.—(412)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 153), which has the
following notes:—‘*Prabhāvatvāt*’ (which is its reading for
‘*Prābhavatyāt*’), on account of being powerful,—‘*saṃskṛtān*,’ endowed
with character and learning if a Brāhmaṇa employs such twice-born men in
work unsuitable for them he should be fined 600 by the king.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 789), which explains ‘*prābhavatya*,’ as
‘*prabhavato bhāvaḥ*,’ *being powerful*;—600 *paṇas* are meant;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 126a), which explains ‘*prābhavatyāt*’ as
‘*prabhutvāt*’, and adds that the mention of ‘*dvijāti*’ makes it clear
that the penalty here prescribed does not refer to the case of *Śūdra*
-slaves.
