<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

What the king should do under the circumstances is now explained.

Having received each of the men with such honour as he deserves, by
reason of his qualifications,—he should, ‘*with the assiatance of
Brāhmaṇas*’—his ministers and priests,—this ‘assistance’ being rendered
in the *reception*, or in the explaining of duties. It is only in the
latter that the true character of the Brāhmaṇa becomes revealed.

With the assistance of these Brāhmaṇas, he shall explain to them their
duty.

The assistance of the Brāhmaṇas having been insisted upon, the
declaration that the king shall explain the duties is meant to indicate
the predominance of the king, who is to associate the Brāhmaṇas with
himself. And this predominance is due to the fact that kings never lose
their temper.

The king should explain the duties to them after having at first
‘*pacified them*’—*i.e*., having soothed their temper—‘*with soothing
words*’—affectionate and complimentary words.—(391)
