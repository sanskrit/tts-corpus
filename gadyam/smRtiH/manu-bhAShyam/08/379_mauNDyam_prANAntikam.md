<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In cases where ‘death’ has been laid down for the *Kṣatriya* and other
castes, it is to be ‘tonsure’ for the Brāhmaṇa. For instance, for
adultery, the non-Brāhmaṇa deserves the death-penalty,—the general rule
being that ‘the male shall be flayed.’

The term ‘*prāṇāntaka*’ is to be explained as *prāṇānām antam gacchati*
or ‘*prāṇānāmant?m karoti*,’—*that which brings about the end of life*;
the form being formed with the ‘*ṇvul*’ affix.

Others read ‘*prāṇāntika*’;—in which case the affix is ‘*ṭhañ*,’—the
meaning being ‘relating to death.’

‘*For the other castes*’—the *Kṣatriya* and others, except the
*Brāhmaṇa*,—‘*it is to be actual death*.’

*Putting to death* having already been prescribed before, the present
text has been taken as serving the purpose of putting forward the
injunction of tonsure and the fine of one thousand, as supplementary to
the former injunction. Otherwise, in as much as the death penalty has
not been prescribed for the *Brāhmaṇa*, what would be the occasion for
declaring that ‘Tonsure is the death-penalty for the Brāhmaṇa?’

It might be argued that the possibility of death-penalty for the
Brāhmaṇa is indicated by the general law that ‘the man should be
flayed.’”

But in that case the substitute should have been put forward in that
same connection; so that the connection of the two could be clearly
perceived.—(379).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 393), which adds the
explanation that ‘for an offence in connection with which death penalty
has been prescribed, the Brāhmaṇa shall only have his head shaved’;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 399);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p.
159);—in *Aparārka* (p. 681), which adds that *banishment from the city*
and such other penalties are equal to the death-penalty, so far as the
Brāhmaṇa is concerned;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 115);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 58b).

**(verses 8.379-381)  
**

*Gautama* (8.13).—‘The Brāhmaṇa who is well-versed in his *dharma* must
not be subjected to corporal punishment; he must not be imprisoned; he
must not be fined; he must not be exiled; he must not be reviled; he
must not be excluded.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.18.17).—‘A Brāhmaṇa, forsooth, shall not suffer corporal
punishment for any offence.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.2-3).—‘In the case of a Brāhmaṇa, no corporal punishment must
be inflicted; a Brāhmaṇa must be banished from the country, his body
having been branded.’

*Nārada* (Theft, 41, 42).—‘On no account shall the King kill a Brāhmaṇa,
though convicted of all possible crimes. He may be banished. The King
shall confiscate his entire wealth or leave him a fourth part for
himself.’

*Bṛhaspati* (27.11, 12).—‘A Brāhmaṇa, though a mortal sinner, shall not
suffer capital punishment; the King shall banish him and cause him to be
branded and shaved; the Brāhmaṇa who deserves capital punishment shall
be compelled to pay one hundred *Suvarṇas*; one deserving to have a limb
cut off, half as much; and one deserving to have the thumb and index
finger cut off, half of that.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 634).—‘Even if he has committed
heinous crimes, the Brāhmaṇa may be banished, branded, or made to
undergo expiations; for the Brāhmaṇa should not be made to suffer bodily
pain.’

*Hārīta* (Do., p. 631).—‘For the Brāhmaṇa, there is no cutting off of
limbs; the Brāhmaṇa is always purified by penances and austerities.’

*Yama* (Do., p. 636).—‘For crimes committed by the Brāhmaṇa, the
following punishments have been ordained: shaving of the head,
banishment from the city, proclamation of his sin, parading on an ass,
branding on the forehead.’
