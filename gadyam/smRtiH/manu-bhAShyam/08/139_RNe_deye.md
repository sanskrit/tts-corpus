When the debtor, on being summoned to the King’s Court, admits the debt
as legally due by him, saying—‘I do really owe this to him,’—then
‘*i.e., deserves five per cent*.’ ‘*as fine*’;—this has to be added. By
this rule, the man is to be fined the twentieth part of the amount of
debt claimed. The man deserves this fine on account of his having
transgressed the law by not satisfying the creditor’s claims outside the
Court and thereby forcing him to come up to the king.

When the man commits a further transgression by denying the claim,
saying—‘I do not owe anything to this person,’—then, on the claim being
proved, the man is to be fined ‘*twice* as *much*’; *i.e*., double of
five per cent.; *i.e*., ten per cent.

‘*Such is the ordinance of Manu*’—Prajāpati; *i.e*., the Rule or Law
propounded by him from the very beginning of creation.

Others have explained the term ‘*as much*’ as referring to the total
amount of the claim, *i.e*., double the sum that is due to the debtor;
as it is only thus that the syntactical connection with the term
‘*debt*’ is maintained; otherwise there is a syntactical split; and as
no different subject has been mentioned, if it referred to the same
subject, then the result would be an option.

This however is not right; for the double of the amount of debt would he
too much. Even though the subject is not definitely mentioned, yet on
account of juxtaposition, it is only right that it should be taken as
referring to ‘*five per cent*.’—(139)

‘*Taddviguṇam*’—‘Double of 5 p. c., *i.e*., 10 p. c.’ This is the
explanation, accepted by all the commentators. But Medhātithi mentions
‘others’ as explaining the meaning to be ‘double of the amount of the
debt’ This latter would be more in keeping with what has gone before in
verse 59.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 77), which adds the
following notes:—The meaning is as follows: If the debt is at first
denied, and subsequently admitted, then the debtor should be fined 5 per
cent on the amount of debt; but if he does not admit it even
subsequently—and yet the debt becomes proved by the evidence
adduced,—then the man shall be fined the ‘double of that,’ *i.e*., 10
per cent. It proceeds to add a note which serves to explain the
inconsistency of this rule with what has gone in verse 59:—the diversity
is due to considerations of the nature of the debtor’s motives.

It is quoted in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 34), which adds the explanation
that ‘when a debt is denied at first and subsequently admitted, the
debtor is to he fined 5 per cent, and if the man continues to deny the
debt which is subsequently proved, the fine is to be 10 per cent; and
adds that this refers to cases where the debtor is poor’;—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (81a), which has the following explanation:—(a) If the
man has denied the debt but admits it when sued in Court, then he is to
be fined 5 p. c., (b) if he continues to deny it in the Court, but the
debt is subsequently proved, then the fine is 10 per cent;—this refers
to cases where the former denial has been based upon some
misapprehension on the part of the debtor; the case where the denial is
through perversity and intentional, has been dealt with under 59.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 111a), which explains the
meaning to be ‘when the man having denied the debt at first, admits it
when sued and brought before the Court, he should pay a fine of 5 p. c.
and if he continues to deny it, but is subsequently forced by evidence
to admit, then 10 p. c.’

*Viṣṇu* (6.20-22).—‘If a creditor goes before the King and fully proves
his demand, the debtor shall pay as fine to the King a tenth part of the
sum proved. The creditor, on receiving the sum, shall pay the twentieth
part of it. If the whole demand has been contested by the debtor, and
even a part of it has been proved against him, he must pay the whole.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.44).—‘Out of the sum proved against him, the King shall
make the debtor pay ten per cent, (as fine) and the creditor, on having
realised his dues, shall pay five per cent,’

*Nārada* (1.132-134).—‘If a wealthy debtor, from malice) refuses to pay
his debt, the King shall compel him to pay it by forcible means, and
shall take five in the hundred for himself. If the debtor acknowledges
the debt with his own mouth, the King shall take from him ten per cent,
of the debt as fine; and twice as much if he has been convicted. If the
debtor, owing to a calamity, has not means sufficient to discharge the
whole debt, the claim of the creditor shall be entered in a legal
document, specifying the caste of the debtor and of the creditor, their
names, and the names of their neighbours.’

*Bṛhaspati* (11.60-02).—‘When the time fixed for pay ment has elapsed,
and the accruing of interest has ceased, the creditor may either recover
his loan or cause a new bond to bo written in the form of compound
interest. This rule concerns an acknowledged debt; but a debtor denying
his liability shall be compelled to pay, on the debt being proved in a
court, by a document or by witnesses.’

*Yama* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 78).—‘If a wealthy debtor refuses to repay
the debt, through ill-will, he should be compelled by the King to pay,
after having realised from him double the amount of the claim.’
