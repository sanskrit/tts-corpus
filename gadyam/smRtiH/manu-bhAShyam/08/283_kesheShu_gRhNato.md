The phrase ‘*out of arrogance*’ of the preceding verse has to be
construed with this verse also.

If the *Śūdra* lays hold of the Brāhmaṇa’s hair, with a view to insult
him, his hands should be cut off. The dual number has been used for the
purpose of indicating that even when the catching is done with a single
hand, since the pain caused is the same as that in the case of catching
with both hands, it is *both* the hands that shall be cut off, and not
*one* only.

‘*Dāḍhikā*’ is *beard*.

In the case of other parts of the body also, the catching of which
causes the same pain as the catching of the neck and other limbs
mentioned, the punishment shall be the same as the one here laid down.

‘*Unhesitatingly*’;—this forbids any consideration regarding the exact
amount of pain caused by the catching,—whether it has been much or
otherwise. The sense is that the punishment is to be inflicted for the
mere *catching*.—(288)

It is difficult to see why Hopkins calls the reading ‘*dāḍhikāyām*,’
‘obscure.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 814), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Dāḍhikāyām*’—on the beard,—‘*Vṛsaṇeṣu* scrotum and the rest; if
the scrotum *alone* were meant, then the plural ending could not be
justified;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 268), which remarks that the dual
ending has been used in ‘*hastau*’ with a view to indicate that *both
hands* are to be cut off even though the beard be held by one only; and
it explains ‘*dāḍhikā*,’ as ‘beard’—and in *Vivādachintāmaṇi* (Calcutta,
p, 76), which explains these two verses to mean that ‘if a Śūdra insults
a man of any of the higher castes by spitting at him, his lips should be
cut off—if by urinating on his body, his urinary organ should be cut
off,—if by passing wind over him, the anus should be cut off,—and if by
catching hold of his hair, then his hands should be cut off.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.65).—‘If he seizes him by his feet, by his hair, by his
garment, or by his hand, he shall pay ten *Paṇas*.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 106).—‘On touching his feet, garment, hands or hair,
the fine shall be multiples of six respectively.’

*Nārada* (15-16.28).—‘If he pulls a superior by the hair, the King shall
unhesitatingly cause his hands to be out off; likewise if he seizes him
by the feet, beard, neck or scrotum.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.217).—‘For pulling a person by the feet, hair, garment
or hands,—there shall be a fine of 10 *Paṇas*; for causing pain,
dragging, binding with cloth and striking with the feet, the fine shall
be a hundred.’
