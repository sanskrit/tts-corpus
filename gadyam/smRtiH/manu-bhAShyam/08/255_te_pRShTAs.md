When the witnesses declare an opinion ‘*unanimously*’—all together; and
there is no difference of opinion among them.

In the case of a difference of opinion, the opinion of a majority of
them should be accepted.

‘*Lay down*’—write down upon a piece of paper;—as also the names of the
witnesses.—(255).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 759);—in *Mitākṣarā* (p. 152), to
the effect that when the witnesses thus questioned unanimously declare
the boundary point, the king shall, for fear of the settlement being
forgotten, record this settlement in writing, setting forth therein all
the boundary marks shown by them as also the names of the witnesses.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 205);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(111a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 141a).
