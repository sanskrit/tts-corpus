‘*In an enclosed field, either on the road-side, or near the village*’—
within the pasture-ground;—the term ‘*anta*’ means *near*;—if the cattle
should eat the crops,—and the keeper be on the spot,—then he should ‘*be
fined* *a* *hundred*’, since no fine could be imposed upon the cattle;
so also when the keeper is close by, if he is too much engrossed in his
family-affairs, and does not send any hired person to see to the cattle.

‘*Cattle without a keeper*’ should he ‘*driven off*’ with a stick or
some such thing; and they shall not he punished. ‘*Cattle without a
keeper*’ that are meant here are such calves as have been sot free in
connection with certain religious rites. (These belong to no one). In
the case of other cattle roaming about without a keeper, punishment
shall he inflicted upon the owner.

Or, we may read ‘*aparivṛtā*,’ ‘*unenclosed*,’ ‘*unfenced*,’ *for*
‘*parivṛtā*,’ ‘*enclosed*,’ and ‘*sapāla*’ may be taken as standing for
‘*the owner along with the keeper*,’—the compound ‘*sapāla*’ meaning a
party other than the one denoted by the terms of the compound, *i.e.,
one along with the keeper*—and the question arising ‘who is to be
punished in this case?’—the answer is that both the owner of the field
and the keeper of the cattle should ho punished;—tho owner being
punished for the fault of having cultivated the field near the road-side
and not fencing it; if it had been fenced, how could the crops have been
eaten?

‘*Cattle without a keeper*’—which may have strayed from the herd—should
be driven off. Says Gautama (12.21)—‘When there is an unfenced field on
the road-side, punishment shall be inflicted on the keeper and on the
cultivator of the field.’—(240)

‘*Vārayet*’—Rāmacandra reads ‘*cārayet*’ and takes the whole verse as a
single sentence—‘If the cattle-keeper *takes the cattle to graze* in a
field that is fenced, he shall be fined along with his master.’

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 232), which reads
‘*cārayet*’ for ‘*vārayet* it explains the meaning of the verse to
be—‘The field on the road-side or on village precincts being duly
fenced, if its crops are eaten (this clause is to be added), then the
keeper of the cattle is to be fined one hundred (*paṇas*), and the stray
cattle is to he caught and tied up.’

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 266), which adds the
following notes:—When a field on the road-side has been duly fenced, if
cattle break through the fence and destroy the crops, the keeper of the
cattle is to be filled a hundred *paṇas*; similarly when a field on the
precincts of a village has been duly fenced, if cattle break into it and
eat the crops, the keeper is to be fined a hundred *paṇas*. This
indicates that there is to be no punishment if the field is unfenced.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 771), which explains the meaning to be
that when the field on the road-side and other such places has been duly
fenced, if it is damaged by cattle which is attended by their keeper,
then the keeper is to be fined one hundred; but if the cattle is
unattended it shall be driven off;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
137b), which explains ‘*pathi kṣetre*’ a s ‘in a field close by the
path,’—and ‘*grāmāntīye*’ as ‘lying on the outskirts of the village.’

*Nārada* (11.28, 29, 35).—‘When crops have been destroyed by cows or
other cattle crossing a fence, the herdsman deserves punishment in that
case, unless he should have done his best to keep the cattle off. When
the crops have been entirely destroyed to the very roots, the owner of
them may claim a corresponding quantity of grain as damages; the
herdsman shall be corporally punished: and the owner of the cattle shall
pay a fine. When cows, straying through the fault of their keeper, have
entered a field, no punishment shall be inflicted on their owner; the
herdsman alone being punishable.’

*Gautama* (12.19-20).—‘If damage is done by cattle, the responsibility
lies on the owner; but if the cattle were attended by a herdsman, then
it falls on the latter.’

*Āpastamba* (2.28.5).—‘If cattle, leaving their stable, eat the crops of
other persons, then the owner of the crops, or the King’s servants, may
make them lean by impounding them; hut this punishment shall not he
over-done.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.140-146).—‘If a she-buffalo damages crops, her keeper shall
he fined eight *māṣas*; if she has been without a keeper, her owner
shall pay the fine. For mischief done by a horse or a camel, or an ass,
the fine shall he the same. For damage done by a cow, it shall he half;
half of that again in the case of the goat or the sheep. For cattle
abiding in the field after eating the crops, the fine shall he double;
and in every case the owner of the field shall receive the value of the
crops that have been destroyed.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.162).—‘In the case of a field on the roadside, or
adjacent to the pasture-land of the village, if cattle is allowed to
graze unintentionally, there is no offence; but if it is done
intentionally, the man deserves punishment like the thief.’

*Uśanas* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 232).—‘If a man asks for compensation for
the crops that may haves been grazed by a cow, his Pitṛs and deities do
not accept his offerings.’
