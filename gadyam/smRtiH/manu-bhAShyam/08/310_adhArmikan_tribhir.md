Having duly emphasised, by means of valedictory declarations, the duty
of restraining thieves, the text proceeds to lay down the law regarding
punishments.

‘*The unrighteous*’—stands, in this context, for the *thief*; him the
king shall ‘*suppress*’—keep in cheek—‘*by three modes of restraint*,’—
the term ‘*nyāy*? (*nyāya*?)’ being used in the literal sense of
‘restraint.’

‘*Imprisonment*,’—confinement in the royal fort, or in the prison-house.

‘*Enchaining*’— keeping in the prison-house, but in chains. ‘*Various
forms of immolation*,’—*i.e*., beginning from *beating* and ending with
actual *death* caused by the killing of the body.

That the methods of restraint are *three* would have been clear from the
enumeration itself; hence the addition of the epithet ‘*three*’ is to be
taken as serving the purpose of indicating that there are other methods
of restraint also; such as the pouring of heated oil and so forth.—(310)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 630), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Adhārmikam*’ means, from the context, the
thief,—‘*nyāyaiḥ*’, restraints, checks,—‘*nirodhana*’, throwing into
prison,—‘*bandha*’, restricting freedom by means of chains and so forth,
—‘*vividhena vadhena*’, in the form of *beating* and the like.

**(verses 8.310-311)**

*Nārada* (Theft, 61).—‘Let the King practise the duties of his office,
and follow the rule of inflicting punishments, faithful to the tenets of
the sacred law. Let him accordingly, as governor, destroy the
evil-doers, after having traced them by the application of cunning
stratagems and arrested them.’

*Bṛhaspati* (27.4 *et seq*.).—‘When he has discovered an offender, the
King shall inflict one of the various kinds of punishments on him,
*viz*., gentle admonition, harsh reproof, corporal punishment, or one of
the four gradations of fines; he shall inflict gentle admonition when
the offence is very light; harsh reproof, for a crime of the first
degree; a fine for crime of the middle degree, and arrest in the case of
high treason. Banishment also may be resorted to by the King.’
