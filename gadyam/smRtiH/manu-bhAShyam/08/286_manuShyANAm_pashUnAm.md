<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse supplies deails (details?) in connection with what has been
said before regarding ‘the breaker of skin, etc.’ (in 281).

If the term ‘*men*’ did not occur, and the verse were taken as referring
to any and every living creature, it would give the idea that the same
punishment is to be inflicted in the case of the larger as well as the
smaller beasts, birds and deer; and it is for the. purpose of precluding
this idea that the term ‘*men*’ has been added.

‘*In proportion to the greatness of the pain earned*’;—if the animal
hurt is a large one, and the extent of the bruise or the quantity of
blood is small, then the hurt being ‘small,’ the fine shall be less than
a hundred; while if the hurt is ‘serious,’ it may exceed a hundred.

Others have said that the text has added the term ‘greatness’ for the
purpose of indicating that in the case of great pain, the fine shall be
increased,—and it does not mean that when the pain caused is not great,
the fine shall be decreased.

‘*With the motive of earning pain*’—*i.e*., when the hurt is inflicted
with the clear intention of giving pain; hence there is no enhancement
of the fine if the hurt has been inflicted by chance carelessness.

These two verses are instances of cases where the attendant
circumstances have to be taken into consideration in the apportioning of
fines for hurt; and it is in this sense that they should be
interpreted.—(286)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 266), which adds that
‘*duḥkhāya*’ means ‘with the intention of giving pain and the addition
of this implies that there is no crime if the hurt is caused by
chance;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 75), which explains
‘*duḥkhāya*’ as ‘with the intention of causing pain.’
