Having raised a question by means of the present verse, the Author
answers it in the next verse: and the grounds for doubt are expressed by
means of the two words ‘*other than that for payment*’ and ‘*whose
character is fully known*’;—the three words with the locative
ending—‘*adātari*,’ ‘*pratibhuvi*’ and ‘*vijñātaprakṛtau*’ being
construed together.

‘*By what means would the Creditor seek to obtain his dues*?’—Should he
seek to obtain it entirely by his own operations? Or should he also urge
the surety’s son?

“Why should there be any such doubt, when it has been distinctly
asserted that in the case of the death of sureties other than that for
payment, the sous shall not be liable?—what connection then can the sons
have with such dues?” The doubt arises because the surety is one ‘*whose
character is fully known*’; which means that it is fully known that the
man had received payment for becoming ‘surety ’; and this fact, being
known, might give rise to the idea that his sons should be liable; since
it is possible that the amount paid to the surety was for the purpose of
paying off the debt in question.

The particle ‘*punaḥ*,’ ‘*then*,’ serves to distinguish the present from
the preceding verse; the meaning being—‘if the liability falls upon the
sons of the surety for payment only, then in the case of the death of
one who is surety *not for payment*, from whom would the creditor, after
his death, seek to obtain his dues?’

The rest has been already explained.

‘*Parīpsā*’ is *seeking to obtain*.—(101)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 43), which takes it as
putting the question which is answered in the next verse. It adds the
following notes:—‘*Adā tari*’, *i.e*., a surety other than the one for
payment (*i.e*., the surety for appearance and the surety for
trust),—being ‘*vijñātoprakṛti*’—*i*.*e*., being known to have stood
surety after having received something in pledge from the debtor; and
thus having its character fully known;—if such a surety dies ,—‘*kena
hetunā*’—by what means—is the ‘*dātā*’—the man who advanced the loan,
the creditor,—to receive back the debt? The work goes on to quote
Halāyudha as explaining the term ‘*vijñatoprakṛti*’as ‘being known that
he became the *lagnaka* (?) on receiving a *pledge*’, and regarding the
verse as denying the creditor’s right to receive payment from the
surety’s heirs on his death. But remarks that the net result of both
explanations is the same.

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (74a), which has the following
notes:—‘*Adātari*’, a surety other than *Dānapratibhū*,—‘*dātā*’, the
creditor,—‘*vijñātoprakṛti*’, one whose solvency is well known.

161	On what account then is it that after the death of a surety other than for payment, whose affairs are fully known, the creditor may (in some cases) afterwards demand the debt (of the heirs)?
