The king obtains the sixth part of the spiritual merit arising from the
open performance of sacrifices by the inhabitants of villages, as well
as by those living in forests; so also the sixth part of the ‘demerit’
acquired by the secret acts of stealing and the like committed by
thieves and others. It is not only by his failure to protect those who
are robbed by thieves that the king incurs sin, but also by his failing
to suppress those who, by committing theft and such other misdeeds,
incur sin, a portion whereof falls upon the king. Because ‘protection’
also means saving them from the incurring of sin. So that if the king
fails in this duty of his, it is only right that he should incur sin.

“In as much as the protection rendered by the king is in return for what
he receives as wages (in the way of taxes), it is not right, to say that
he obtains the sixth part of the people’s spiritual merit.”

It has already been explained that there are many persons who pay no
taxes at all,—such as the poor, the orphans, the ascetics and so forth.
So that if the king fulfills his full duty, what incongruity is there in
the assertion made in the text?—(304)

“This is that famous ‘sixth’ of good or evil which the king draws upon
himself by protecting or neglecting his people; he revives a sixth of
the produce as tax (7.130), and in return, it may be, must give security
to the realm, or he gets the same proportion of the fruits of their bad
deeds; or (*cf*. verse 308) he takes all the sin of the world.
Yājñavalkya says (1.334-336) he takes one-sixth of the fruit of their
good deeds, but one half of their sin in case he does not protect them.
Similarly the sixth or the twelfth part (8. 35), or half (8.39) is the
share of the treasure the king receives; and again in 8.18 he receives a
fourth of the fruits of the sin caused by a wrong decision in
court.”—Hopkins, who refers to the Mahābhārata (13.61.34-35), where, in
regard to the sin, different views (fourth part, half, whole) are set
forth and then the conclusion stated in favour of the *fourth* part,
which, it is said, is in accordance with the ‘teaching of Manu.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 397);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 255);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (p. 73p);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 263).

engaged in protecting them.’
