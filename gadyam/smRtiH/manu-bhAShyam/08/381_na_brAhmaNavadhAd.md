पूर्वशेषो ऽयम् अर्थवादः । **न ब्राह्मणवधाद्** अन्यो बहुतरो **ऽधर्मो** दुःखफलो ऽस्ति । अन्यशब्दाध्याहारेण पञ्चमी । **तस्माद्** धेतोर् **अस्य** ब्राह्मणस्य **राजा** मारणम् अङ्गछेदं वा **मनसापि** नेच्छेत् ॥ ८.३८१ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is a declamatory supplement to what has gone before; Than the
slaying of the Brāhmaṇa, there is no ‘*greater crime*,’—sin leading to
greater suffering.

The Ablative in ‘*vadhāt*’ is to be explained by supplying the term
‘*aṅgaḥ*.’

For this reason, the king should not even think of inflictin g either
death or amputation on the *Brāhmaṇa*.—(381)
