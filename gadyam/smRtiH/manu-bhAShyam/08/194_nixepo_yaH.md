As much of a certain deposit has been entrusted in the presence of a number of men—so much should it be decided to be; the party misrepresenting it becomes liable to punishment.—(194)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Certain*’ refers to the kind or quality of the substance, and ‘*as
much*’ to its *quantity*, *e.g*., one party says—‘I had deposited gold
with him and he is giving me back bell-metal; I had deposited a hundred
and he is giving me only half of it’;—on being asked—“Did you hand over
the deposit in secret or before witnesses?”—if he says ‘*in the presence
of a number of men*’—*i.e*., witnesses—then what these men, on being
questioned, should declare, should be regarded as the truth.

‘*Misrepresenting*’—*i.e*., asserting otherwise than this, the party is
punished.

If however the complainant says that the deposit was not handed over in
the presence of witnesses, there is an occasion for the admitting of
other kinds of proof.

This verse also prescribes nothing new.—(194)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 664), which explains ‘*vibruvan*’
as ‘telling what is not true;’—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 94), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Vibruvan*,’ declaring it to be more when it was
less; from a parity of reasoning, it follows that if the depository also
declares the deposit to be less where it was really more, he also should
be fined;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (85a).
