What is here laid down pertains to offences committed among the
twice-born men themselves, as also between two *Śūdras*.

When one only ‘*breaks*’ or pierces the skin, and fetches no blood, the
fine is one hundred.

The same also when blood flows out. Though no blood can flow out unless
the skin has been broken, yet the limitation on the fine has been laid
down with a view to preclude the idea that since the hurt is more
serious, the punishment should he heavier.

Others hold that this has been added in view of the fact that blood
flows also out of the ear, the nostrils and such other pans, as also out
of the outer skin (and the rule is meant to apply to this latter ease).

This however is not right. Because in a case where there is internal
hurt, the pain is very severe, and the punishment therefore should be
proportionately heavy. Hence what is meant is that the fine of one
hundred shall be inflicted in a case where only a small quantity of
blood has flown out.

In the case of head-breaking, the punishment shall be the same as that
in the case of cutting the flesh.

The term ‘*niṣka*’ here stands for a measure of gold, as has been
already explained before.

‘*The breaker of bones should be banished*,’;—*i.e*., one who causes the
bone to be broken. The compound ‘*asthibhedakaḥ*’ should be explained by
compounding ‘*asthi*’ (‘*bone*’) with the term ‘*bheda*’ which ends with
the ‘*ghañ*’ affix, and then adding the causal affix in the sense of
‘*doing*’ to the compound thus formed (*i.e*., ‘*asthibhedam karoti iti
asthibhedakaḥ*’).

‘Banishment’ is an alternative to ‘Death.’ In works dealing with the
science of government, in the sections dealing with punishments, we find
the latter penalty laid down; for instance, in the works of *Bṛhaspati*
and *Uśanas*. So ‘banishment’ applies to the case of Brāhmaṇas, and
‘death’ to that of others.—(284)

“According to Rāghavānanda the rule refers to Śūdras assaulting Śūdras.
According to Nārāyaṇa, the last offender’s property shall be
confiscated.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 164), which remarks that
in view of the law laid down by Viṣṇu, that for causing bleeding the
fine shall be 64 *paṇas*,—the penalty here laid down should be
understood to be applicable to cases where there is much bleeding caused
by the tearing of the skin.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 287);—in *Aparārka* (p.
815) which adds that, the bleeding is due to grievous hurt, then the
fine is to be 100, otherwise 64;—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.218), where
*Bālambhaṭṭī* remarks that the penalty here laid down applies to cases
where the hurt has been inflicted on some vital part of the body;—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 74), which explains ‘*niṣka*’ as
equivalent to four ‘*suvarṇas*’

*Viṣṇu* (5.66-72).—‘If he causes pain to him, without fetching blood, he
shall pay 32 *Paṇas*; for fetching blood, 64;—for mutilating or injuring
a hand, or a foot, or a tooth,—and for slitting an ear, or the nose,—the
second amercement. For rendering a man unable to move about, or to oat,
or to speak,—or for striking him violently,—the same punishment is
ordained. For wounding or breaking an eye, or the neck, or an arm, or a
hone, or a shoulder, the highest amercement. For striking out both eyes
of a man, the King shall confine him and not release him from the jail
as long as he lives;—or he shall order him to be mutilated in the same
way.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.218-220).—‘If one causes pain with wood and other
things, without fetching blood, he should ho made to pay a fine of 32
*Paṇas*; on fetching blood, the double of that. If he breaks a hand, or
a foot, or a tooth, or slits the ear or the nose, or reopens a wound, or
beats him nearly to death,—the middle amercement. On incapacitating him
from moving, eating or speaking, also for piercing the eyes and other
organs, or for breaking the shoulder, or the arms or the thighs, the
middle amercement.’

*Nārada* (15-16.29).—‘If a man breaks the skin of an equal, or fetches
blood from him, he shall be fined a hundred *Paṇas*; if he cuts the
flesh, 6 *Niṣkas*; if he breaks a bone, ho shall be banished.’

*Bṛhaspati* (22.720).—‘For injuring a person with bricks, stones or a
wooden club, he shall he fined two *Māṣas*; double of this, if blood
flows. For tearing the skin, the lowest amercement shall be inflicted;
for tearing the flesh, the middle amercement; for breaking a hone, the
highest amercement; for killing, capital punishment. For breaking the
oar, the nose or hand, or injuring teeth, or feet,—the middle
amercement; and double of that for cutting off any of those limbs. He
who injures a limb or divides it, shall be compelled to pay the expense
of curing it.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 107).—‘On hurting a person, without fetching blood,
with wood, stones, bricks, iron-stick, or ropes—the fine shall be 24
*Paṇas*; double of that if blood is fetched. The lowest amercement for
beating a man nearly to death, without fetching blood; as also for
disabling a hand or foot. For breaking the hand or foot, or for tearing
the nose or the ear, or for opening a wound, the same punishment. For
breaking the thigh or the neck or the eyes, or making one unable to
speak or move or eat,—the middle amercement; also the expenses for
effecting a cure. If the man happen to die, the culprit should be tried
as a heinous criminal.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 265).—‘For striking a man with bricks,
stones or wooden sticks, the fine is two *Māṣas*; double of this if
blood is fetched; for cutting of the ear, the lip, the nose, the eye,
the tongue, the penis or the hand,—the highest amercement; and for
piercing these, the middle amercement.’

*Hārīta* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 266).—‘If a low-caste man breaks the head,
or ears or any limb of a person of the higher castes, he shall be fined
200 *Purāṇas*; for striking him with the foot, his feet shall be cut
off, or he shall he fined 500.’
