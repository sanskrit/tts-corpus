If there arises any neglect regarding the safe keeping of the cattle,
‘*during the day*,’— such as those going to be described under
232,—‘*the responsibility*’—blame—‘*rests with the keeper*’; and he has
to bear the blame

‘*During the night*,’ the blame lies with the owner,—if the animals die
while tied up;—‘*if in his house*,’—if they have been safely penned in
the house by the keeper.

‘*If otherwise*,’—*i.e*., if they have not been brought into the house
during the night, and have been kept in the pastures,—the blame lies
with the keeper.

The meaning is as follows:—During the time that the cattle are under the
charge of the keeper, if they graze in the cultivated field of a man, or
if they are killed,—the fault lies with the keeper; but if anything
happens after they have been made over to the owner, then it lies with
this latter.

As the blame is in connection with *non-safety*, the term
‘*yoga-kṣema*,’ ‘*safety*,’ should be taken as figuratively indicating
its opposite; just as the epithet ‘beautiful-eyed’ is applied to a blind
man.—(230)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 171) which says:—If there
is anything remiss in the safety of the cows during the day, the
‘*vaktavyatā*,’ responsibility, blame, lies on the keeper; if it is at
night, then on the owner;—but if the ‘*yogakṣemam*’ (which is its
reading for ‘*yogakṣeme*,’ *i.e*.,) the agreement between the keeper and
the owner, is ‘otherwise,’ then during the night also, the keeper is
responsible.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 772), which explains ‘*vaktavyatā*’ as
fault or blame;—and in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 530), which quotes Kullūka, who
explains the second half as meaning that ‘if during the night also the
cattle are in charge of the keeper, then if there is any thing wrong,
the blame lies on the keeper’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*, (p. 81).
