Words expressive of something to be done is called ‘*Bhāṣā*,’
‘*contract*’ in general; and what is there laid down should be done.

“Is it meant that no contract is valid?”

No; that only which is ‘*contrary to law*,’—that is regarded as
‘contrary to law,’ ‘illegal,’ which is opposed to practice sanctioned by
the scriptures; *e.g*., interest more than five per cent., the selling
of wives and children, the giving away of one’s entire hereditary
property and so forth.

‘*Even though fully substantiated*,’—*i.e*., reduced to writing, or
pledged by a surety, and so forth;—it is ‘*not valid*’

^(‘)*Custom*’—practice sanctioned by
usage;—‘*established*’—long-standing, not modern.

This verse is supplementary to what has gone in the preceding verse,
regarding the invalidity of gifts and other transactions effected by
dependent persons and by persons not in their senses and so forth.—(164)

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (65b), which adds the following
explanation:—An agreement, even though formally put in writing, has no
legal force, if it is contrary to the laws and customs prevalent among
business-men; and such an agreement cannot be enforced,—such agreement,
for instance, as where a man who has children agrees to bequeath all his
property to a stranger.

It is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 21b and 39b), which has
the following notes—‘*Pratiṣṭhita*’, free from the defect of being
impossible and unknown and so forth,—‘*bhāṣā*’, proposition,
statement,—is not ‘*satya*,’ accepted by the king or the court,—‘that
statement which is contrary to all rules of business, even though it be
established by evidence, oral and documentary, should not be accepted’;
*e.g*., the statement that ‘this man has promised his entire property to
me’,—when the man concerned is one who has got sons and oilier
successors.

*Viṣṇu* (7.11).—‘That instrument is termed *proof* which is not adverse
to peculiar local usages, which detines clearly the nature of the pledge
given, and is free, from confusion in the arrangement of t he
subject-matter and in the succession of the syllables.’

*Nārada* (1.136).—‘That, document is said to be valid which is not
adverse, to the custom of the country, the contents of which answer to
the rules regarding pledges and other kinds of security and which is
consistent in import and language.’
