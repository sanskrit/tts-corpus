<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Either through childishness, or through jealousy for her greater beauty,
if a maiden pollutes another maiden, then she should be made to pay two
hundred; and also the double of her nuptial fee.

What Is the amount of this fee?

It shall depend upon the beauty of the girl, or upon her fortune and
other qualities.

‘*Lashes*’—strokes of rope or creeper.—(369).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 321);—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 403), which adds that ‘*dviguṇam*’ means ‘double
of 200’;—and ‘*śiphā*’ stands for ‘strokes of creepers, ropes and such
other things’;—in *Aparārka* (p. 859), which adds the following
explanation:—If one maiden happen to penetrate another with her fingers
or some such thing, she shall pay a fine of 200 to the king, and that
fee or *price* which the defiled maiden is worth, *three times* (its
reading being ‘*triguṇam*’ or ‘*dviguṇam*’) that shall be paid to her by
the other girl, who is, in addition, to receive ten stripes—*i.e*.,
strokes of rope or creepers.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.288) to the same effect; where it adds
that ‘double the fee’ (*dviguṇam śulkam*) is to be paid by the offending
girl to the *father* of the defiled girl.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1016);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 157a).
