In the case of all deposits, such should be the method of restoration; but in the case of a sealed deposit, he should incur nothing, if he does not extract anything from it.—(188)

In the case of open deposits ‘*the method of restoration*’ shall be as
just described in [verses 182 *et
seq*.]

The depositary shall not incur the censure of the debtor, as regards the
deposit to be restored.

This same rule should be applicable to the case where the article
deposited has been destroyed by rats, etc. For instance, the article
deposited having been wrapped up in a piece of cloth and placed in a
wooden vessel, if rats, with their sharp teeth, should cut through the
wood and devour the article,—it is no fault of the depositary’s. Then
again, if the article is deposited in the form of a bundle sealed in a
basket,—on account of its being such as cannot be contained in a wooden
box,—then also if it is eaten by rats, it is no fault of the
depositary’s. This is specially so, if it is known to the depositor, who
has been informed by the depositary that he possesses no wooden box
(where the article would be safe from rats, etc.),—or if the depositor
knows the man’s character and is close by (and hence is in a position to
know that the article has been really damaged by rats).—(188).

The second half of this verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 86),
which adds the explanation that if the deposit has been handed over to
the depository *sealed*,—then, unless the latter extracts anything from
it, he shall incur no blame; but if he does extract anything, then he
certainly becomes open to censure. In the case of an unsealed deposition
the other hand, even though he may have extracted something, if he
delivers it before the depositor, he does not incur blame.

*Nārada* (2.14, 15).—‘The same law applies in the case of *Yācita*,
*Anvāhita*, and other forms of deposits, also in those of articles made
over to artisans, as also *Nyāsa* and *Pratinyāsa* deposits; if a man
takes charge of a wealthy boy, the law applicable in this case also is
the same.’

*Bṛhaspati* (12.15).—‘The same set of rules applies in the case of a
bailment for delivery to a third party, a loan for use, an article made
over to an artisan, a pledge and a person offering himself for
protection.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.67).—‘The same law applies to the other forms of
deposit- the *Yācita*, the *Anvāhita*, the *Nyāsa* and the *Nikṣepa*.’

188	Such is the rule for obtaining back all those open deposits; in the case of a sealed deposit (the depositary) shall incur no (censure), unless he has taken out something.
