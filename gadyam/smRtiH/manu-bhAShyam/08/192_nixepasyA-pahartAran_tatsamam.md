In all cases the king shall make the appropriator of a deposit pay a fine equal in value to it; also the appropriator of a friendly loan.—(192)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The preceding verse has laid down the punishment to be like that of the
thief; under that rule there are two alternatives—corporeal punishment
and fine equal in value to the property involved—to he determined
according to the caste of the accused. So that in the case of castes
other than the Brāhmaṇa, it would, under the said rule, he open to the
king to inflict either of the two forms of punishment. And it is this
possibility that is precluded by the present verse, which restricts the
punishment to *fine* only; so that from among the penalties inflicted on
thieves, what may be added to the *fine* is only *admonition* or
*reprimand*, and not *mutilation* and other corporeal punishments.

It will not be right to take the present verse as precluding corporeal
punishment from the case of Brāhmaṇas, who also would be subject to both
kinds of alternative punishments sanctioned by the preceding verse.
Because corporeal punishment has been already generally prohibited in
the case of Brāhmaṇas;—in such texts as ‘one shall not strike a
Brāhmaṇa’ (8.380).

‘*Upanidhi*’ here stands for what is used through friendship.

‘*In all cases*,’—*i.e*., irrespectively of the nature of the property
or the caste of the person involved.

Others have given a technical meaning to the term ‘*upanidhi*’; but that
meaning is applicable elsewhere, not here. Because, in the absence of
any convention, fixing the technical sense of a term, the right course
is to take it in its ordinary sense. This same ‘*upanidhi*’ is going to
be mentioned again as ‘*friendly loan*’ (under 196).—(192)

This verse appears to be a mere repetition of 191. According to
Medhātithi, 191 lays down two alternative punishments—corporal
punishment (thief’s penalty) and fine; and 192 excludes the ‘thief’s
punishment’ by specifying the fine only. He repudiates the explanation
that has been attributed to him by Hopkins—*viz*., 192 is for the sake
of freeing the *Brāhmaṇa* from the corporal punishment prescribed in
191. Nor is there anything in Medhātithi to show that he takes 192 as
referring to fresh offences,—a view that has been attributed to him by
Buhler.—Both these views are found in Kullūka.

‘*Upanidhi*’—‘Sealed deposit’ (Kullūka);—‘something lent in a friendly
spirit’ (Medhātithi, who repudiates, in the present context, the
technical meaning of ‘sealed deposit.’)

‘*Aviśeṣeṇa*’—‘Irrespective of the character of the property or the
caste of the person’ (Medhātithi);—‘irrespective of caste’ (Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 92), which adds the
following explanation:—The reiteration of ‘fine equal in value to the
deposit’ here—to the exclusion of the ‘thiefs penalty,’ with which it
has been coupled in the preceding verse,—should be understood as meant
for the case where the misappropriator of the deposit is a Brāhmaṇa. The
terms ‘*tathā*’ and ‘*aviśeṣeṇa*’ mean that all that has been said in
regard to the misappropration of the deposit, should he understood to be
applicable to that of the *Upanidhi* also,—the misappropriation of both
standing on the same footing.

It is quoted also in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 85);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(83b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 113a).

192	The king should compel him who does not restore an open deposit, and in like manner him who retains a sealed deposit, to pay a fine equal (to its value).
