The man having been charged with the words—‘This man is refusing to
restore my deposit, because there are no witnesses to it,’—if he admits
it ‘*in the form and shape*,’ etc.—The distinction between ‘form and
shape’ is based upon the deposit hearing or not bearing a secret
seal;—or it may he based upon the action of the Receiver and the
Depositor.

The deposit should be restored as unhesitatingly and quickly as it had
been received;—that is, there should be no delay in the
restoration.—(183)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 664);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 94), which continues the explanation (see last note)—‘If the man
admit the deposit and surrender it exactly in the condition in which it
had been deposited—neither more nor less,—then the king should conclude
that the former deposit, the subject-matter of the dispute, had not been
made over to him, and he should be acquitted of the charge brought
against him by the other party’.
