‘*Goats and Sheep*,’—‘Sheep’ also includes the wild goat.

When these have been ‘*surrounded* *by* *wolves*’—jackals and the
rest—and they are not killed outright at the very first onset,—so that
there is time to come forward and rescue the animals,—and yet ‘*the
keeper does not come forward*’—to rescue them; under such circumstances,
if the wolf should ‘*forcibly kill any*,’— the blame lies with the
keeper. That is, he should he made to make it good to the owner, and
also perform an expiatory rite.

Cows are large animals, and hence cannot he ‘surrounded’ by jackals,
etc.; hence the present verse has specified ‘*goals and sheep*’; it does
not follow that the rule applies to these animals only; so that this
same rule applies to the case of young calves also.—(235)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 773):—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p.
175), which notes that ‘goats and sheep’ stand for all such animals as
are liable to be attacked by wolves; and explains ‘*Samruddhe*’ as
*attacked*;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 265), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Anāyati*’, not coming to ward off the
attack,—‘*yām*’, animal belonging to the category of ‘goats and
sheep—this pertains to cases where the attack takes place in easily
accessible places; in the case of its coming in a place which is
inaccessible, no blame attaches to the keeper;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(105b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 137a), which explains
‘*anāyati*’ as ‘if he does not come to avert the danger.’

*Narada* (6.15).—‘If goats and sheep are surrounded by wolves, and the
herdsman does not come to their assistance, he shall he responsible for

*Viṣṇu* (5.137-138).—‘Cattle being attacked, during daytime, by wolves
or other ferocious animals, and the keeper not going to repel the
