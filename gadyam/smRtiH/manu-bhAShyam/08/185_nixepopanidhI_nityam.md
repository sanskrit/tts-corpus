Deposits, open and sealed, should never be handed over to the next-of-kin; in the event of a mishap occurring, they become lost; though they do not become lost, if no mishap occurs.—(185)

‘*Next-of-kin*,’—of the depositor; *i.e*., his son, or brother, or wife.
If the depositor has the right of ownership, so has his wife also; the
son also has a right over the property of his grandfather; and the
brother also, who is still united in property, has a right over it.
Hence, if the depositor happens to be sent, any one of these relatives
may tell the depository—‘give the deposit to me, it belongs to me’;—on
this the depository may hand it over to him thinking—‘this is their
joint property, one has deposited it and another is taking it away, what
harm is there in this?’—and it is with a view to guard against this that
the text says—‘*Deposits, open or sealed, shall not be handed over to
the next-of-kin*.’

A hortatory argument is added—‘*In the event of a mishap occurring, they
become los* t,’—‘*mishap*’ in the form of the kinsman going out of the
country and so forth,—if any such happens ‘*they become lost*.’ If the
kinsman, having received the deposit, did not make it over to the person
who had deposited it, then, on being charged by the latter, what answer
could the depositary give? It would be no answer to say—‘it was taken
away by your brother, who was the joint owner of it’; because it has
been declared—‘as the delivery so the recovery’ (180); so that the
deposit should be restored to the person who actually deposited it, be
he the rightful owner or not. This is the simple fact that is set forth
in this detail.

If however nothing happens to the ‘next-of-kin’ then there would be no
harm in restoring the deposit to him; this is what is meant by the
assertion.—‘*They do not become lost, if no mishap occurs*.’ Because in
this case the answer of the depositary would be—‘I restored it to him as
otherwise it might become lost with me.’

What the text means is that—‘if the deposit has been taken away by the
depositor’s kinsman, then, on being asked by the depositor to restore
it, the depositary shall make it good out of his own property.’—(185)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 87), which adds the
following explanation:—If the depositor is living, deposits, sealed or
open, should never be given by the depository to any such near relative
of the depositor as may have a share in the property,—during the absence
of the depositor himself; for if the said relative happen to die, the
deposits become lost, *i.e*., they do not reach the depositor himself;
though if the relative does not die, they may perhaps reach him. So that
in the event of the relative’s death, it would be open to the original
depositor to demand from the depository the value of the deposits; and
in order to guard against this, the depository should always return the
deposits to the depositor himself, while he lives.

It is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (83a).

*Bṛhaspati* (12.9).—‘A deposit must he restored to the very man who kept
it, in the very manner in which it was delivered; it must not be
restored to the next of kin (of the depositor).’

185	An open or a sealed deposit must never be returned to a near relative (of the depositor during the latter's lifetime); for if (the recipient) dies (without delivering them), they are lost, but if he does not die, they are not lost.
