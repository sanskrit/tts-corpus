Forfeiture of the wages has been declared to be the penalty for the man
when not ill; the present verse lays down the law regarding one who is
ill.

If the labourer falls ill and gives up work after it has been
half-done,—hut, on recovering, comes hack and completes the task as
originally stipulated,—in this case, even though he may have taken a
long time to recover from illness and return to work, the man shall,
receive his wages, on having completed the work.—(210).

*Kṛtyakalpataru* (102a), winch adds the explanation that the man who had
stopped the work through some disability—if, on recovery, he comes and
completes the stipulated work, then, if it were done after a lapse of
time, he should receive his wages.
