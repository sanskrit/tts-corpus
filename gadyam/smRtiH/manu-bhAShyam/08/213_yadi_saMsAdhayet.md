‘*Seeking to recover it*’—*i.e*., filing a suit before the King, with a
view to recover it in the manner of a debt;—when, on being asked to pay
back what he has already received, the man files an application before
the King, saying ‘Having given the money to me he seeks to take it away
from me’; the ‘recovering’ of the gift consisting, in this case, of its
being *confirmed*.—This is done cither ‘*through arrogance or
greed*’;—this describes the causes of the action mentioned before.

The penalty for the man who does this act shall be ‘*one
gold-piece*’;—‘*as an expiation for that theft*’;—lest people think that
the man, being regarded as a thief, should suffer the penalties
prescribed for theft, the author has laid down the penalty as ‘*one gold
piece*.’ And yet he has used the word ‘*theft*’ with a view to preclude
the notion that the man is not a ‘thief,’ since what he has taken was
given to him and he did not take it away himself. The meaning thus is
that, though the man is a ‘thief,’ yet his punishment, as here laid
down, shall consist of ‘one gold piece’ only, but in all other respects,
he is to be treated as a ‘thief.’—(213)

‘*Saṃsādhayet*’—‘If he tries to enforce the fulfilment of the promise by
a complaint before the king’ (Medhātithi);—if he tries to obtain the
money forcibly or refuses to refund it’ (Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and
Govindarāja);—‘if he should withhold the repayment’ (Rāmacandra, who
reads ‘*Sandhārayet*’);—‘if the man should really perform the act for
which he had begged, then the man who had promised to pay, but did not
pay, (or having paid, took it back), should be made to pay to him a
*Suvarṇa*, by way of fine, for not fulfilling his promise’ (Nandana, who
has been misrepresented by Hopkins).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 137), which explains the
meaning to be—‘if, through annoyance or greed, he should accomplish the
purpose (*artham sādhayet*), then he should be fined by the king one
*Suvarṇa*.’

It is quoted also in *Aparārka* (p. 782), which adds the following
explanation:—‘If on being asked to refund, the man, through annoyance or
greed, does not refund the money, but complain before the king with a
view to establish the fact that the gift should not be taken back,—then
he should be forced to refund the money’;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (94a).

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 94).—‘If a gift is made under fright,—for fear of
punishment, or blame or calamity,—the man accepting the gift should be
punished as a thief;—so also one who offers and accepts a gift in anger
for the injuring of a third person.’
