The mother does not deserve to be forsaken,—should net be cast off.
‘Forsaking’ consists in turning her out of the house, if she has failed
in her maternal duties; *i.e*., if she fails to do what she ought to do
in return for what she receives at the bands of her son.

The same explanation applies to the case of the father and the rest
also.

The term ‘*strī*’ (woman) stands for the *wife*, as is clear from the
fact that the text mentions only relatives.

These should not be forsaken, unless they are outcasts. As regards the
mother, Śātātapa has declared that ‘to the son the mother never becomes
an outcast.’

The ‘forsaking’ of the outcast, wife consists in giving up all
intercourse with her and in forbidding her to do household work; but the
giving of food and clothing is not forbidden; as it is declared
that—‘food and clothing should be given to even outcast wives, and these
should live near the house.’—(389)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 357), which notes that
‘*tyāga*,’ ‘abandonment,’ here means ‘not according such treatment to
them as has been prescribed in the scriptures’;—and that ‘*strī*’ here
stands for the *wife*.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 823), which remarks that this rule refers
to the abandoning of all the four collectively;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(p. 154).

*Viṣṇu* (5.163).—‘A husband forsaking a blameless wife shall be punished
as a thief.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.237).—‘Between father and son, brother and sister,
husband and wife, teacher and disciple,—if one forsakes the other,
unless he or she has become an outcast, he shall be fined one hundred.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Aparārka, p. 823).—‘The father and the mother should
never be forsaken; indeed no Sapiṇḍas possessing good qualities should
be forsaken; if one forsakes these arbitrarily, unless they have become
outcasts, he should he fined 200. Nor should one misbehave towards the
father, mother, or teacher; one who misbehaves towards them shall have
his limb cut off.’
