‘*Annāda*’—one who eats food.

‘*Bhrūṇahā*’—he who has killed a Brāhmaṇa.

This latter ‘*expurgates*’ throws upon ‘*the man who eats his
food*’—‘*the guilt*,’ of killing the *Brāhmaṇa*; just as when the dirty
cloth is washed in water, its dirt becomes thrown into the water.

This is a purely valedictory declaration. The meaning is that the guilt
becomes separated from the Brāhmaṇa-killer, and attaches itself to the
other man.

On the ‘*pati*’—the husband —‘*the mishaving*’—adulterous—‘*wife*’—if he
condones the act. Here also the guilt disappears from the wife and
attaches itself to the husband.

‘*On the preceptor*, *the disciple and the sacrificer*’;—if the disciple
transgresses the laws relating to sun-rise, etc., and the preceptor
condones it, the guilt becomes thrown upon the latter. Similarly the
‘sacrificer’ on the officiating priest; since the latter is a
‘preceptor’; that is why the ‘officiating priest’ has not been mentioned
separately.

Similarly ‘*the thief on the King*,’—if he is not punished by the King.

If the sacrificer, in course of the sacrificial performances,
transgresses the rules, and does not adhere to the advice of the
officiating priest,—then he should be abandoned by the latter; and he is
not to be chastised and beaten, in the manner of a disciple.

In regard to the ‘*man who eats his food*’ and the rest, the present
text should not he taken as laying down an injunction; the whole of it
is purely declamatory.—(317)

Mss. N and S place 317 and its *Bhāṣya* after 318 but both add a note to
the effect—‘*ayam shloko rājabhirityasmāt pūrvam lekhanīyaḥ*’, ‘this
verse should be written after the verse *rājabhiḥ &c*.’ This is
apparently a corrector’s note on the mistake committed by a copyist.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 509), which adds the
following note:—‘*Kilviṣam*’ is to be construed with each of the
four—‘*annāda*’, ‘*pati*’, ‘*guru*’ and ‘*rājā*’—and ‘*mārṣṭi*’ means
‘passes on.’

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 146), which explains ‘*mārṣṭi*’
as ‘transfer’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 781).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (19.44).—‘They quote the following verse:—“The slayer of a
learned Brāhmaṇa casts his guilt on him who eats his food; a misbehaving
wife on her husband; a student and a sacrificer on the teacher and the
officiating priest; and a thief on the King.” The guilt falls on the
King who pardons an offender, if he causes him to he slain, he destroys
sin in accordance with the sacred law.’

*Āpastamba* (1.19.15).—‘They quote the following:—“The murderer of a
Brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda heaps his guilt on his guest; an innocent
man on his calumniator; a thief set at liberty, on the King; and the
petitioner, on him who makes false promises.”
