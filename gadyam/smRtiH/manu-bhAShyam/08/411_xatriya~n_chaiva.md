The Brāhmaṇa shall support them, if they are ‘*distressed for a
livelihood*,’ by giving them food and other things; *i.e*., he shall
support the *Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya*.

‘*Through compassion*’—through pity.

‘*Should make them do his own work*.’—The Brāhmaṇa’s ‘own work’ consists
in the fetching of fuel, water and such things.

Or, the meaning may be that he should make them perform such duties as
are the *Kṣatriya’s and the Vaiśya’s* own. That is, the *Kṣatriya*
should be employed in guarding the village and so forth, and the
*Vaiśya* in cultivating the land, tending the cattle and so on.

This law relates to the Brāhmaṇa who is possessed of much wealth and
property and is, as such, capable of supporting others.

‘*Own work*;’—the phrase implies that he should not employ them in
personal attendance, or in any such meat, work as the washing of unclean
things and the like.—(411)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 253), which explains
‘*svāni karmāṇi*’ as ‘duties prescribed for their respective castes’;—in
*Aparārka* (p. 789);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 126a), which
says that the meaning is that ‘if a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya has become a
slave through want of living, his master should treat him well and take
light work from him.’
