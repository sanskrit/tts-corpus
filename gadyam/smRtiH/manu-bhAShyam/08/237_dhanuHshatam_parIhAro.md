the ‘bow’ is four cubits in length; four hundred such ‘bows.’

‘*Around*’— on the four sides, ‘*of the village*,’—the
‘*pasture-ground*’ shall he reserved; that is, this much of space should
be left uncultivated, for the roaming about of cattle.

‘*Śamyā*’ is a stick; this should be thrown with great force; and from
the point where it falls, it should be thrown again; and when this has
been done three times, that shall represent the size of the
pasture-ground.

‘*Three times that around the town*’;—the distinction between ‘village’
and ‘town’ is well known.

‘*Stick-throws*’—*i.e*., its being thrown, falling on the ground on the
momentum being spent up, and so forth.—(237)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 774), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Śaṃyā*’ is the piece of wood which serves as the bolt keeping
the bullock fixed to the yoke,—and the distance covered by the tin-owing
of tins piece of wood is what is called ‘*Śamyāpāta*.’

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 231), which, reading
‘*Saṃyāpātāḥ*’ (in place of ‘*Śaṃyāpātāḥ*’) notes that the ‘*Sami*’ is a
wooden bolt, and three times the distance covered by the throwing of it
should be the extent of the pasture-land round the village, and three
times this should be the pasture-land surrounding a city.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 96), which explains ‘*parīhāra*’
as ‘land reserved for the grazing of cattle—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 817).

*Yājñavalkya* (2.166-167).—‘In accordance with the wishes of the
village-people, and in consonance with the extent of land available and
the orders of the King, pasture-land for the grazing of cows shall he
reserved...... This pasture-land shall he one hundred bow-lengths in
extent, and shall he beyond the village and the cultivated holds; it
shall he two hundred how-lengths round a market-town, and four hundred
bow-lengths round a city.’
