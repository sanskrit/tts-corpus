‘*Justice and Injustice’ alone* are desirable and undesirable. It is not
that the ‘desirable’ consists in the obtaining of cattle, gold and other
things, or that the ‘undesirable’ in the reverse thereof; in fact it is
‘Justice’ that is ‘desirable’ and ‘Injustice’ that is
‘undesirable’;—‘*understanding*’ this—*i.e*., having come to this
conclusion in his mind,—‘*he shall look into the suits*.’

Or, the text may mean that the king shall examine what is ‘desirable,’
and what is ‘undesirable,’—and also what is ‘Justice’ and what is
‘Injustice.’ That is, he should realise the importance of ‘Justice’ and
the unimportance of what is merely ‘desirable;’ or that when the element
of ‘undesirability’ is very large, and that of ‘Injustice’ very
small,—there he shall avoid the former; because it is possible for a
slight ‘Injustice’ to be set aside by the larger ‘desirable’ factor
through gifts and expiatory rites.

In the event of several suitors coming up at the same time, he shall
take them up in the order of their castes; but this order of
investigation based upon castes is to be observed only when the troubles
of all the suitors are of the same degree; when, on the other hand, the
business of the lower caste is very urgent or very important, then this
should he taken up first, in accordance with the maxim ‘he whose trouble
is urgent, etc., etc.’; and in this case the order of the castes is not
to be strictly observed. It has already been said that the investigation
of cases is for the purpose of maintaining order in the kingdom; so that
the rules laid down need not always be followed literally.—(24)

‘*Arthānarthāvubhau buddhvā dharmādharmau ca kevalau*’—Medhātithi has
given three explanations of this (See *Translation*):—‘Fully realizing
the wordly evils and advantages, but paying due heed to Dharma and
Adharma as alone conducive to spiritual results’
(Kullūka);—‘discriminating the righteous and the unrighteous, and taking
up the righteous first’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana);—‘knowing what will
please and what displease the people and understanding what is just and
what is unjust’ (Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 46), as laying
down the order in which the king is to take up the cases, when several
come up at the same time;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 80);—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru*, (16b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, p. 19a).

*Śukranīti* (4.5.113-117).—‘The King with the Ministers after receiving
the plaintiff duly should first console him and then commence the trial,
he should then enquire of the plaintiff standing submissively before him
—*What is your business? What is your complaint? Do not be afraid—by
what ruffian and under what circumstances hare you been molested?*’

*Bṛhaspati* (1.24).—‘Let the King, or a member of the twice-born caste
officiating as Chief-Judge, try causes, acting on principles of equity,
and abiding by the opinion of the judges, and by the doctrine of the
sacred law.’

*Nārada* (1.31, 31, 35).—‘A King who acts justly must reject error when
brought forward, and seek truth alone; because prosperity depends on the
discharge of duty. Therefore let a King, after having seated himself on
the seat of judgment, be equitable towards all beings, discarding
selfish interests and acting the part of Yama Vaivasvata. Attending to
the dictates of the Law, and adhering to the opinion of the Chief-Judge,
he should try causes in due order, exhibiting great care.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Parāśaramādhava- Vyasa, p. 46).—‘Where two complainants
arrive accusing each other and claiming the first hearing, the King
shall admit them, either in the order of their castes, or in accordance
with the comparative seriousness of the complaints.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do.).—‘Between two mutual complainants, that man should be
treated as the plaintiff whose hurt or complaint is more serious,—and
not necessarily the man who appears first before the court.’

*Nārada* (Do.).—(Same as Kātyāyana.)
