<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Saptāhāt*,’ ‘*within a week*,’—the use of the Ablative implies that
the proposition ‘before’ is understood. That is, on anyone of the seven
days, after he has given evidence, if the witness is found to suffer
from sickness, it implies that he has been adjudged by destiny to be a
perjuror, and hence he should be punished in accordance with the
aforesaid rule.

‘*Illness*’ stands for any kind of acute suffering;—‘*fire*’ for the
burning of cattle and conveyances;—and ‘*death of a relative*’ for the
death of the son or the wife or some other near relative;—all these
being indicative of his having given false evidence.—(108)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Yājñavalkya* (2.113).—‘If a man suffers no calamity, arising either
from the King or from some supernatural force, within fourteen days (of
his deposition), he should undoubtedly be regarded as pure (honest).’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 715).—‘If the man suffers some calamity after the
lapse of two weeks, he shall not be accused on that account (of
dishonesty).’

*Viṣṇu* (14.4-5).—‘He to whom any calamity happens within a fortnight or
three weeks—such as an illness, or fine, or death of a relative, or a
heavy visitation by the King,—should be known to be
dishonest,—otherwise, he should be known as honest.’

*Pitāmaha* (Aparārka, p. 715).—‘If within three days, or seven days, or
two weeks, some calamity befalls the man, he should be regarded as a
sinner. If he alone, and none other, should suffer from illness, or
death of a relative, or fine, this would be an indication of his sin.’
