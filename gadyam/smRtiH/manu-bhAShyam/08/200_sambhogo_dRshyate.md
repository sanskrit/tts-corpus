Where possession is evident, but no sort of title is perceptible, there title, and not possession, shall be the proof; such is the settled rule.—(200)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In a case where, in connection with such things as cattle, gold, lands
and so forth, one man is found to have ‘possession,’—while the ‘title,’
arising from inheritance, gift and other sources, indicates the
ownership of another man,—it is ‘title’ that is to be regarded as more
authoritative; and mere possession is no proof of ownership.

‘*Such is the settled rate*’;—the eternal rule is that mere possession
does not create ownership; what sort of possession does create ownership
has been explained before, under verse 147; and the seeming
incompatibility of the present verse with that has also been explained
under that same verse.—(200)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 635), which says that what is
meant is that what proof of ownership is, not mere possession, but
possession accompanied by ‘title’—*i.e*., something that indicates
actual ownership.

*Yājñavalkya* (2.171).—‘By title and by possession shall the rightful
owner establish his claim to a lost property; if he fails to establish
his claim, he shall be fined; he should be made to pay a fine the fifth
part of the value of the article concerned.’

200	Where possession is evident, but no title is perceived, there the title (shall be) a proof (of ownership), not possession; such is the settled rule.
