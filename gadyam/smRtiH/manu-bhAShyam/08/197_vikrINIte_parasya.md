The text now proceeds to deal with the head of dispute called ‘Sale
without Ownership.’

The ‘*property*’—articles—that belongs to another person,—if a person,
who is not the owner—*i.e*., who is not the son or any such relative of
the owner,—and who has not obtained the consent of the
owner,—‘*sells*,’—him the judge shall regard as a ‘*thief*’; though the
person who buys it from him may not regard him as a thief.

Him the judge ‘*shall not admit as a witness*,’— shall not call him as a
witness; because he is just like a thief; and being a thief, he is not
fit for being called as a witness.

The present exclusion is meant to be, not only from being called as a
witness, but from all such acts as are to be done by a gentleman.

When a property is sold by one who is not its owner, without the consent
of the real owner, it does not become the property of the buyer;—this
fact being already known, the forbidding of such a transaction by means
of asserting that such a person is not fit for being called as a
witness, is meant to be only a diversified way of saying things—(197)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 103), which explains the
phrase ‘*na tam nayet sākṣyam*’ as ‘should place no confidence in
him’;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 26b);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p.
41), which explains ‘*sākṣyam*’ as ‘trustworthy evidence’;—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (85b), which explains ‘*na tam nayet sākṣyam*’ as ‘no
trust is to be placed in him’—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 115b).

*Vyāsa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 100).—‘An article borrowed for use, deposit
