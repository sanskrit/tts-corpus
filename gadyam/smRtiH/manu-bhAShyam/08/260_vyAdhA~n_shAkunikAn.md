These persons wander about in the forests surrounding villages, without
entering the villages themselves, and might know the exact boundaries.
Passing by that way, they might have seen some persons cultivating the
fields lying within the disputed area, and might have asked them—‘what
is this village, in which you are cultivating fields?’ In this manner,
it is quite possible for them to have acquired the required experience.

‘*Hunters*’;—those who live by hunting; these also come into contact
with villages, when pursuing game that has escaped from forests.

Similarly ‘fowlers,’ who live by bird-catching, roam about all the
villages, in search of birds.

‘*Cowherds*’ roam about in search of particular kinds of fodder for
their cattle.

‘*Fishermen*,’ ‘*Dāśas*,’—those who live by digging tanks, etc., wander
about in search of work.

‘*Boot-diggers*,’—those who dig up the roots of thick grasses and other
plants.

‘*Snake-catchers*,’—those who catch serpents, by way of livelihood.
These men are likely to visit several places, and thus come into contact
with the inhabitants of several villages.

‘*Gleaners*’;—very poor people who, after wandering about several
villages, earn just enough to serve as food for the day.

‘*And others*’—who go about searching fruits, flowers, fuel and such
things.—(260)

‘*Vanācāriṇaḥ*’—‘Those who roam about forests in search of flowers,
fruits and fuel’ (Medhātithi);—‘*śabaras* and other foresters’
(Nārāyaṇa).

*Medhātithi* does not read ‘*śataśaḥ*’ as Hopkins says.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.152), on which *Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following notes:—‘*Vyādhān*,’ fowlers,—‘*śākunikān*,’ those who live
by killing birds,—‘*kaivartān*,’ those who live by digging tanks
etc.,—‘*mūlakhātakān*,’ those living by digging up the roots of trees
etc.,—‘*vyālagrahān*,’ serpent-catchers,—‘*uñchavṛttinaḥ*’ those who
live by gleaning corn,—‘*vanagocarān*,’ those who roam about in forests
in search of flowers, fruits and such things.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 209);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 272), which adds that ‘*anyān*’ includes persons whose
business it is to dig up and raise boundary marks;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(111b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 140b).
