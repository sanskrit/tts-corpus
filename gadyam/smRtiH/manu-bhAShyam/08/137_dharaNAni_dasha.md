Ten ‘dharaṇas’ are to be known as the ‘silver śatamāna’ (centimetre); and the ‘niṣka’ should be understood as four ‘gold-pieces’ in weight.—(137)

‘*Śatamāna*,’ ‘*Centimetre*,’ is the name for ten ‘*Dharaṇas*’; here the
term ‘*Silver*’ includes *Gold* also. Hence the name ‘*Śatamāna*’ here
put forth is applicable to both gold and silver; but its exact measure
when applied to gold is to be ascertained from other treatises; since it
is here distinctly specified as the ‘*Silver-Śatamāna*’—(137)
