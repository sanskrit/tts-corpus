<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In the sacrificial performance, the man who does the most laborious
parts of the work and is employed to do what demands much effort,
receives a larger fee, and he who does the easier parts receives loss;
similarly among ordinary workmen also, those, *e.g*., employed in the
building of houses and temples,—when they do the work ‘jointly,’ as
among the architect, the mason and the carpenter.—their several shares
shall be alloted ‘*by* *the application* *of* *these
principles*’;—‘principle’ is *rule* laid down in the *Veda*, hence this
phrase means ‘according to the rule laid down in the Veda in connection
with sacrificial performances.’

Similarly in the producing of a drama, and such other business, the
shares are to ho alloted among the dancers, the singers and the players
of musical instruments.

Even though everyone of the persons concerned may be well versed in the
science and quite capable of doing all the work, yet the shares are to
be alloted in accordance with the work that is actually done by each,
and according to the character of the man concerned.

Thus ends the treatment of ‘Joint Concerns.’—(211)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 221), which
remarks that this distribution pertains to only cases where the thing to
be divided is mentioned as common to all;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (90a);—and
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 119b), which says that this refers, *not*
to the fee that is prescribed for individual priests, but to the *common
fee* of 1200 cows, which is prescribed for all the officiating priests.

*Yājñavalkya* (2.259).—‘Among traders carrying on a joint concern for
profit, their profit and loss shall be commensurate with the share of
capital contributed by each.’

*Nārada* (3.1-3).—When traders or others carry on business jointly, it
is called *Partnership*. When several partners are jointly carrying on
business for the purpose of profit, the contribution of funds towards
the common stock of the association shall form the basis of their
undertakings. Therefore let each contribute his proper share. The loss,
expenses and profit of each partner are either equal to those of other
partners or exceed them, or remain below them, according as his share is
equal to theirs, or greater or less.’

*Bṛhaspati* (14.3).—‘As an equal, smaller, or larger share of the joint
stock has been contributed by a partner, in the same proportion shall he
defray charges, perform labour and obtain profit.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.614-618).—‘Those who deal in gold, grains and liquids,
jointly, will have the earnings according to the amount of their share,
greater, equal or less. Whatever portion has been stipulated
beforehand,—equal, less or greater,—that shall he accepted. Expenditure
he shall pay and do the labour also proportionately, and take the profit
also in the same manner.’
