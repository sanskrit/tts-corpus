<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The author is going to describe the details regarding the ‘*safe
keeping*’ (mentioned in the preceding verse).

One who ‘keeps’ the ‘cattle’ is the ‘*cattle-keeper*,’ the herdsman.
Sometimes he is engaged on fooding and other kinds of wages, and
sometimes on milk. Of these he who is ‘*paid with milk shall milk the
best*—*varām*—*out of ten*’;—or the ‘*worst*,’ ‘*avarām*,’—the initial
‘a’ being mixed up with the preceding vowel.

The wages are to be commensurate with the labour involved in the
keeping. If the man receives nothing else,—in the shape of
subsistence,—he shall take the milk of one cow. The exact wages, more or
less, of the man shall be determined according to this rate. Thus for
the work of looking after milch and non-milch cows, heifers, bulls and
calves, the owner shall apportion to the keeper sometimes the third, and
sometimes the fourth, part of the entire milk-produce.

This verse is meant only to alîord some indication of the subject. In
fact in each individual case, local custom has got to be followed.

If the herdsman of the village omits to look after the eattle, with the
idea of having his wages fixed beforehand, then he shall not. milk one
of the ten cows, without having obtained the owner’s permission.

‘*With the owner’s permission*’;—this has been added for the purpose of
precluding the possibility of the keeper taking the milk in lieu of the
‘fooding’ on which he has been engaged. The meaning is that if he milks
the cow without the owner’s permission, he shall he punished.

‘*This*’—*i.e*., what has been just mentioned—‘*shall be the wages if he
receive no other wages*’; *i.e*., this shall be the wages of the keeper
engaged ‘on milk.’

‘*Hired*’—*i.e*., he who takes up the work of keeping the cattle for the
purpose of making a living, and not for acquiring spiritual merit.

Or, the meaning of the verse may he that “if the man, entirely out of
his own wish, takes the milk of every tenth cow, he shall he regarded as
a thief; but if he has obtained the owner’s permission, then it becomes
his due ‘wages,’ and there is nothing wrong.”

“But in the case mentioned in the verse also, if the man took the milk
without the owner’s permission, he would be doing something wrong.”

True; but in this case he would be only liable to punishment, and he
would not be a ‘thief’; while in the other case he would be either a
‘thief’ or a ‘misappropriator of a trust.’

This verse should have gone before; some people read it later on.—(231)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 170), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kṣīrabhṛtaḥ*’, whose wages consist of milk
only;—‘*duḥyad daśato varām*,’ he should milk that cow (for himself)
which is the best among ten cows;—‘*sā*,’ the said milk of the one
cow;—‘*pāle*’, for the cowherd;—‘*abhṛte*,’ who is not paid any thing
else in the shape of fooding, clothing, and so forth.

This is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 772) winch adds the following
explanation:—That keeper of the cattle who has his wages paid in milk,
shall, with the owner’s permission, milk the best cow among ten milch
cows, taking that for himself,—this being the ‘wage’ of the
cattle-keeper who does not receive wages in any other form;—in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 80), which explains ‘*Kṣīrabhṛtaḥ*’ as ‘one whose
wages are paid in the form of milk only’;—he shall milk the best of ten
cows;—‘*abhṛte*’, the keeper who gets no fooding and clothing,—and notes
that this refers to the keeper of milch-cattle only:—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(104b), which explains ‘*Ksīrabhṛtaḥ*’ as ‘one whose wages consist of
milk only; he shall milk for himself that cow which may be the best
among ten cows—but only once’; —‘*abhṛte*’ one who receives no food or
clothing;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 136b), which says that the
milk of the best among ten cows is to be taken by the cowherd only when
he receives nothing else as wages.

*Viṣṇu* (5.139).—‘If the cowherd milks a cow without permission, he
shall pay twenty-five *Kārṣāpaṇas* as a line.’

*Nārada* (6.10).—‘For tending a hundred cows, a heifer shall be given to
the cowherd as his wages every year; for tending two hundred cows, a
milch cow, and he shall be allowed to milk all the cows every eighth
day.’

*Bṛhaspati* (16.19).—‘A man hired for attendance on the wild cows of
another person shall receive the whole milk every eighth day.’
