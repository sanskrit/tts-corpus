<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The present verse shows by what sort of purchase real ownership is
produced.

‘*Vikraya*,’ ‘*market*,’ is the place where people sell their goods. If
one obtains from the market, some property,—goods put up for sale, in
the shape of cattle and the rest,—or the price is paid for it,—‘*he
acquires it*’— by ‘*legal purchase*,’ by paying the proper price,—‘*in
the presence of witnesses*’—in the shape of intermediaries and brokers;
and thus ‘*he acquires it*,’ and does not forfeit it. If the thing has
been purchased from one who is not the rightful owner of it, then the
property is restored to the rightful owner, and the *bonafide* purchaser
obtains the price he had paid from the person who had sold it to him. In
the event of his purchase being not *bonafide*, he is punished and also
forfeits the property. This is what is thus asserted—‘The purchaser
proves his *bonafides* by producing the seller, the rightful owner
receives the property, and the king receives the fine paid by the
seller, the purchaser receives back the price he had paid from the
purchaser’ (*Yajñavalkya*, 2.170).

This same idea is set forth in the present verse.—(201)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 103), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Vikrayāt*,’ from the market-place;—‘*Kulasannidhau*,’
in the presence of trustworthy traders and brokers;—‘*Nyāyataḥ*,’
qualifies ‘*krayeṇa*’;—‘*viśuddhaḥ*’ (which is its reading for
‘*viśuddham*,’) faultless;—‘*labhate dhanam*’, *i.e*., from the
seller;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (85b), which has the following
notes:—‘*Vikrayāt*,’ ‘from the ‘*market place*,’ the word being
explained as ‘*vikrīyate asmin iti vikrayaḥ*,’—‘*kulasannidhau*,’ in the
presence of a number of business-men,—‘*nyāyataḥ*’ is to be construed
with ‘*krayeṇa*,’ and means a *bona fide* purchase, on payment of the
proper price.

*Bṛhaspati* (13.7, 8, 10).—‘When a purchase has been made before an
assembly of merchants, the king’s officers also being aware of it,—but
from a vendor whose habitation is unknown, or when the purchaser is
dead,—the owner may recover his own property by paying half the price
tendered; the custom in that case being that one half of the value is
lost to each of the two parties. When a man purchases a commodity at a
fair price, and the purchase has been announced to the King, there is no
wrong about it.’

*Bṛhaspati* (12.3, 4).—‘When the vendor has been produced and has been
cast in the suit, the judge shall cause him to pay the price to the
buyer, a fine to the King, and to restore the property to the owner.
When the former owner comes forward and makes good his claim to the
article purchased, the vendor shall be produced by the purchaser; by
doing so, the purchaser may clear himself.’

*Nārada* (7.2-5)—‘No blame attaches to a sale effected in public; but a
clandestine sale is viewed in the same light as theft, according to law.
The purchaser must not make a secret of the way in which he came by a
chattel purchased by him. He becomes free from blame if he can point out
the way in which the chattel was acquired by him. In any other case he
is equally guilty with the vendor, and shall suffer the punishment of a
thief. The vendor shall restore the property to the rightful owner, and
shall pay to the buyer the price for which it was sold to him; besides
that, he shall pay a fine to the King.’
