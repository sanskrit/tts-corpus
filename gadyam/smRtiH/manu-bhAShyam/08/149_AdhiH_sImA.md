‘*Ādhi*’ is that which is *pledged*; an article given as pledge,—such as
cattle, land, gold and so forth,—to the creditor; and recovered from him
(upon re-payment of the debt).

‘*Upanidhi*’ has been explained,—in accordance with another treatise
(Yājñavalkya, 2.65) as a deposit, whose form is not shown and which is
handed over, covered with cloth and sealed. But this being already
included under ‘*deposit*,’ it is better to take the term ‘*upanidhi*’
as standing for what is given for use, through friendliness and favour.

‘*Boundary*’—the boundary-line between villages, etc. It is quite
possible that it being a public concern, men are likely to ignore
encroachments upon it. In the case of houses, the boundary-line, marked
by ditches or walls, two, three or four cubits in size, is common to
both; and if either side of it happens to crumble down in time, as the
matter would be a slight one, even encroachment might be ignored for
some time by a certain person. But since in such matters also the owner
fearing the loss of ownership through gift, etc., his sons or grandsons
do discover some hidden marks of the original boundary and assert their
claims to the recovery of the boundary encroached upon.

‘*Minor’s property*’;—this has been added only by way of illustration;
the *minor* having been already referred to by the name ‘*pogaṇḍa*’ (in
Verse 148).

‘*Women*,’—slave-girls or wife; as no other woman, save these two, have
anywhere been described as ‘property,’ ownership over which could be
lost through possession extending over ten years, as spoken of in Verse
147.

*Objection*.—“But the text (147) does not speak of ‘*property*’ at all;
the expression used is ‘*whatever thing*,’ which refers to *things in
general*.”

No; the use of the term ‘*dhani*,’ ‘*owner*,’ clearly indicates that the
expression ‘whatever thing’ refers *to property*, which, in this case,
is used in the sense of *anything that is used*; and this mention of
women as ‘property’ indicates all kinds of possessions. From this
analogy of ‘property,’ males also, as slaves, are actually regarded as
‘property.’

‘*The king’s propety*;’—the ‘*kings*’ meant here are the rulers of
provinces; the property belonging to such rulers. These people have vast
properties, which they cannot always watch over carefully; so that if
their property were liable to be lost through adverse possession, they
would soon be reduced to penury.

‘*The properly of Vedic Scholars*’—though poor in comparison,—has yet
got to be preserved with care.—(149)

‘*Śāstrāntareṇa*’—(Medhātithi, p. 965, l. 1)—This refers to Yājñavalkya,
2.65. ‘*Vāsanasthamanākhyāya haste nyasya yadarpayet*’; and
Nārada—‘*asaṅkhyātamavijñātam samudram yannidhīyate*.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 109), which
adds that the term ‘*śrotriya*’ includes also all such persons who have
their attention too much taken up by other things to allow their looking
after their belongings in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 158), which
notes the following reasons for neglect—(*a*) In regard to boundaries,
people are apt to be lulled into security by the ease with which the
boundary-line can be determined,—(*b*) in regard to women, their natural
shyness lulls men into security,—(*c*) in the case of the king and the
scholar, their minds are too much taken up with their temporal and
spiritual concerns respectively;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*, (Vyavahāra,
69b).

*Śukranīti* (4.5.445).—‘The following property cannot be destroyed by
length of adverse, possession:—pledge, boundary-land, minor’s property,

the property of Vedic Scholars.’

*Nārada* (1.81).—‘A pledge, a boundary, property of a child, an open
deposit, a sealed deposit, women, what belongs to the King, or to the

present occupant, or his son, in maintaining possession of the property
of an infant, or of a learned Brāhmaṇa, or the property inherited from
one’s father;—nor of cattle, a woman, a slave, or other property.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (16.18).—‘They quote the following:—“A pledge, a boundary,
the property of minors, an open deposit, a sealed deposit, women, king’s
property and property of the Vedic Scholar are not lost by being enjoyed
by others.”

*Gautama* (12.39).—‘Animals, land, and females are not lost by adverse
possession.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.25).—‘A pledge, a boundary, deposit—^(:) open and
sealed, the property of infants, idiots, and of the King, and of women,
and of the Vedic scholars;—with the exception of these, all property
becomes lost to the owner by adverse possession extending over twenty
years.’
