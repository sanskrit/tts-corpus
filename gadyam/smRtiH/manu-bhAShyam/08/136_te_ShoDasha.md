Sixteen ‘*Silver-Beans*’ make a ‘*Silver-Dharaṇa*’; of which the other
name is ‘*Purāṇa*.’

‘*Kārṣāpaṇa*’ and ‘*Paṇa*’ are the two names of the ‘Copper-karṣa’; the
term ‘*Karṣa*’ is used here in the sense in which it is used among the
people, and it is not used in any technical sense, in the way in which
‘*Kṛṣṇala*’ and other terms have been used.—(136)

“*Karṣa =* 16 *Māṣas* = 80 *Kṛṣṇalas*.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 115), which
adds that the names ‘*purāṇa*’ and ‘*dharaṇa*’ stand for the tenth part
of a ‘*pala*’ of *silver*; the name, ‘*māṣa*’ as applied to silver,
stands for the fortieth part of the ‘*karṣa*’.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 666), which explains the
construction as ‘*dharaṇam rājatam purāṇaśca rājataḥ*’; and explains
that ‘*kārṣāpaṇa*’ and ‘*paṇa*’ are the names of the *copper* ‘*karṣa*’.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (1.364 and 365), to the effect that
‘*dharaṇa*’ is only another name for ‘*purāṇa*’; and adds the
explanation that a piece of copper one *karṣa* in weight is called
‘*paṇa*’, and also ‘*kārṣāpaṇa*’;—in *Hemādri* (Vrata, p. 53);—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Dāna, 4a).

136	Sixteen of those make a silver dharana, or purana; but know (that) a karsha of copper is a karshapana, or pana.
