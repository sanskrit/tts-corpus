Even though one has lost her chastity, if the woman continues to be
protected by her father, brother or relatives,—and a Brāhmaṇa has
intercourse with her by force, he should be made to pay one thousand.

If however the woman is protected and still chaste, then the man is to
be banished and branded, in addition to the fine.

Even if the word ‘protected’ be taken to mean *chaste*, the Brāhmaṇa
would be absolved by paying a thousand ‘banishment’ and ‘branding’ being
the general punishment laid down for all cases of immoral intercourse
with other women.—(378)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 317), which
remarks that this refers to cases where the woman is not the wife of
one’s teacher or friend;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 393);—in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 105), as laying down the penalty for forcible
intercourse with a chaste Brāhmaṇa woman;—in *Mitākṣarā* (p. 256) where
*Bālambhaṭṭī* notes that inasmuch as the latter half contains the
epithet ‘*icchantyā*,’ ‘willing,’—which is in contradistinction to
‘*balāt*,’ ‘by force,’ of the former half,—it follows that in case the
first half refers to the *guarded* woman, the second half must refer to
the *unguarded* one; the meaning being that if a Brāhmaṇa has connection
only once with a willing woman of the same caste, he should be fined
500;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 330);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
144b and 155b), which explains ‘*guptam*’ as ‘properly guarded’; and
adds that this refers to cases of adultery other than those with the
wife of the *guru* or the *friend*, for which latter other penalties
have been prescribed.
