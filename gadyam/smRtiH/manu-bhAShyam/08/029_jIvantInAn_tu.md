<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This ‘punishment of thieves’ has been laid down for those relatives who
should appropriate the property of women. They appropriate her property
in manifold wavs; giving out., for instance, that—‘she is not mistress
of herself as regards what she gives away and what she enjoys,—I am the
real owner of the; property.’

It is in view of the possibility of people thinking that such
misappropriators are not ‘thieves’ that the text lays down the
‘punishment of thieves’ for them.

‘*While they are alive, if the relations*’—brother-in-law and
others—‘*should appropriate their property*,—*on them the king shall
inflict punishment*,’—shall punish them.

The ‘punishment of thieves’ is going to be described later on (verse
334)—‘With whatever limb a thief operates against men, each of those
limbs the King shall cut off, in order to prevent the repetition of the
act.’

What the verse means is that the property of helpless women should be
specially guarded against her own relations; guarding against thieves
being the duty that has been laid down for the King as owing to the
entire kingdom.—(29)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.147), in support of the view
that except the husband, no co-parcener should lay hands upon the
property of women during their life-time;—in *Aparārka* (p. 752), to the
effect that when the woman is *dead*, her relations do have a right to
her *Strīdhana* property;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 512); and in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 70).

*Kātyāyana* (Aparārka, p. 752).—‘While the woman is alive, her husband
or sons or brother-in-law or relations have no power over her
*strīdhana*; if they take it from her, they should be punished.’

*Agnipnrāṇa* (Rājadharma, 222.21).—(Same as Manu.)
