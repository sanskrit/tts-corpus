<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse forms the basis for all penalties and offences, described
above; and it is in accordance with this that all punishment is to be
determined.

‘*Motive*,’ ‘*anubandha*,’ literally means *repealed action* or *that
which leads to repeated action*; the meaning thus is that the king shall
ascertain what it was that led the man to commit the offence, *i.e*., he
shall find out if he was urged to it by the starving condition of his
family, or by association with criminals, or by reason of his being
addicted to drink and gambling,—and if he did it intentionally or by
mistake,—if he was urged to it by another person, or he did it
voluntarily. These are the points to be considered in the ascertaining
of the man’s ‘*motive*.’

‘*Place*,’—a village, forest, granary or pasture-ground.

‘*Time*’—whether it was night or day; whether it was a time of scarcity
or of plenty; whether the criminal is a youth or a full-grown person.

‘*Condition*,’—capability or otherwise to suffer the penalty,—whether he
is rich or poor.

^(‘)*Offence*’—under which of the eighteen categories the act falls.

Having, in due order, considered all this, the king shall ‘*inflict the
punishment*,’—so that the condition of the society may not suffer.—(126)

‘*Anubandham*’—‘Motive or frequency’ (Medhātithi and
Govindarāja)—‘frequency’ (Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Sārāprādhau*’—Nandana reading ‘*Sārāsārau*,’ explains it as ‘strength
or weakness of the offender.’

Tins verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 627), which explains
‘*Sāra*’ as *strength* and ‘*anubandha*’ as ‘repetition of the improper
act.’

*Gautama* (12.51).—‘The award of punishment must be regulated by a
consideration of the status of the criminal, of his bodily strength, of
the nature of the crime, and whether the offence has been repeated.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.367).—‘On those deserving punishment, the King shall
inflict punishment after having considered the nature of the crime, the
time, place and strength of the criminal, as also his age, conduct and
wealth.’

*Nārada* (Punishments, 38).—‘After carefully considering the nature of
the offence, the place and time, and after examining the ability of the
offender, and his motive, he shall inflict the punishments.’

*Bṛhaspati* (27.4-7).—‘When he has discovered a man to be an offender,
the King should inflict on him, reprimand, reproach or corporal
chastisement, or one of the four grades of fines. He shall inflict
gentle reprimand when the offence is very light; harsh reproach for a
crime of the first degree; a fine for a crime of the middlemost degree,
and arrest in the case of high treason. Banishment also may be resorted
to by a king desirous of promoting his own welfare;...... and all the
various forms of punishment should be combined in the case of one who
has committed a mortal sin. The King should punish elders, domestic
priests and persons commanding respect, with admonition only; other
litigants he should punish with fine, when they are found guilty; and on
the perpetrators of a heavy crime, he should inflict corporal
punishment.’
