This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 680), which adds the following
notes:—False evidence is given only through these causes;—‘*lobha*’ is
greed for wealth,—‘*moha*’ is mistake,—‘*ajñāna*’, imperfect
knowledge,—‘*bālabhāva*’ extreme youth;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (37a);—and
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 50b).

**(verses 8.118-123)**

*Śukranīti* (4.5.337).—‘The man who hears false evidence, and the man
who suppresses evidence are to receive double punishment.’

*Nārada* (1.193-97).—‘One who, weighed down by the consciousness of his
guilt, looks as if he were ill, or shifts his position constantly, runs
after everybody:—who walks involuntary and without reason, and draws
deep sighs; who scratches the ground with his feet and who shakes his
arms and clothes;—whose countenance changes colour, whose forehead
sweats, whose lips become dry and who looks about and above himself;—who
makes long and irrelevant speeches as if he were in a hurry, and without
being asked;—such a person may be recognised as a false witness, and the
King should punish that sinful man.’

*Viṣṇu* (8.18).—‘A false witness may be known by his altered looks, by
his countenance changing colour, and by his talk wandering from the
subject.’

Do. (Aparārka, p. 680).—‘Of false witnesses, the whole property should
be confiscated.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.81).—‘Forgers and false witnesses should be separately
punished with line which is double the value of the suit; but the
Brāhmaṇa should be banished. The witness who having made a statement
before others, conceals it from the court, through folly,—should be made
to pay a fine eight times the value of the suit; but the Brāhmaṇa should
he banished.’
