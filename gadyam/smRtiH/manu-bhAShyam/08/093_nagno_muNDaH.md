‘*Potsherd*’—a piece of the cup or some other earthenware pot. The rest
is easily intelligible.—(93)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

Hopkins remarks that ‘*gṛham*’ is the reading of Medhātithi (for
‘*Kulam*’). But there is nothing in the *Bhāṣya* to show this.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 674);—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Vyavahāra, p. 204);—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (35a).
