‘*Unfair punishment*’ is that punishment, that savours strongly of
injustice;—*i.e*., one that takes no account of what has been just said,
and which is determined cither entirely on the basis of the letter of
the law, or by the king’s whim, or by love, hatred and such other
feelings.

Such a punishment is ‘*destructive of reputation*,’ also ‘*subversive of
fame*’; ‘reputation’ consists in the man’s good qualities being known in
his own country, while ‘fame’ in their being known in foreign countries.
Or ‘reputation’ may consist in one’s good name during life.—Or the
passage being a purely commendatory one, some other distinction may be
drawn.

‘*Leads to loss of heaven*’;—*i.e*., obstructs the passage to heaven,
that might have been opened by other meritorious deeds.

‘*In the other world*’;—this has been added for filling up the metre;
‘heaven’ itself being the other world.—(127)

**(verses 8.127-128)  
**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (19.42-45).—‘If an innocent person is punished, the domestic
priest shall perform a *Kṛcchra* penance; and the King shall fast during
three days and nights.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.356, 358).—‘Punishment illegally inflicted by the King
destroys heaven, fame and worldly prosperity; legally inflicted, it
brings to the King heaven, fame and victory. If the King punishes those
who deserve punishment, and if he kills those who deserve to be killed,
he offers, thereby, sacrifices at which excellent sacrificial fees are
given.’

*Nārada* (Punishments, 61).—‘Let the King, faithful to the tenets of the
sacred law, practise the duties of his office and follow the rule of
inflicting punishment. Let him destroy, as governor, the evil-doers,
after having traced them by cunning stratagems and arrested them.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 649).—‘By not chastising evil-doers,
and by punishing those who are already submissive, kings and ministers
incur sin.’

127	Unjust punishment destroys reputation among men, and fame (after death), and causes even in the next world the loss of heaven; let him, therefore, beware of (inflicting) it.
