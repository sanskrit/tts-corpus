‘*Śūdra*’—*i.e*., down to the *Caṇḍāla*;—‘*having
intercourse*’—sexual—‘*with a twice-born woman*’;—‘*protected or
unprotected*’—by her husband,—shall be punished according to law.

What shall be the punishment?

If he has intercourse with an unprotected woman, he shall be deprived of
his ‘*limb*,’ and also of ‘*his whole property*.’

As to the question regarding what he is to be deprived of, the answer is
provided by the epithet ‘*aṅgasarvasvi*,’ which mentions the ‘*limb*’
and the ‘*whole properly*’; especially as nothing else is mentioned, and
no other thing is specified.

The limb of which he is to be deprived is that with which he has
offended.

If he has intercourse with a ‘*protected*’ woman, ‘*he is to be deprived
of everything*,’— not of only one limb, but of the whole body.

The present verse lays down the amputation of the limb, the confiscation
of his entire property, and the inflicting of death, as forms of
punishment,—the sense being that punishment should be inflicted on the
man. Says Gautama (12.2):—In the case of intercourse with women, there
should be amputation of the generative organ and also the confiscation
of his entire property,—if she happens to be protected’—(374)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra p. 378), to the
effect that when a Śūdra has intercourse with an *unguarded* woman of a
higher caste, his organ is to be cut off and all his property
confiscated, and if he has recourse to a *guarded* woman of the higher
caste, he shall suffer death and his entire property shall be
confiscated.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 395), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Dvaijātam varṇam*’, a woman of the twice-born
caste,—‘*āvasan*’, having recourse to,—‘*aguptaikāṅgasarvasvī*’ (which
is its reading for ‘*aguptamaṅgasarvasvī*’), if the woman is one who is
*not guarded*, the man shall be deprived of one limb and also of his
entire property; and of his entire property as also of his entire body
(if the woman is one who is *guarded*).

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.280), which has the same explanation as
the one in para 1 above;—in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 100), which also has
the same explanation—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 156a).

**(verses 8.374-378)**

[(See the texts under
372.)]

*Gautama* (12.2).—‘If a Śūdra has intercourse with an *Ārya* woman, his
organ shall he cut off, and all his property shall be confiscated.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.52).—‘Let him burn in straw-fire a Śūdra who has
intercourse with an *Ārya* woman.’

*Āpastamba* (2.27.9).—‘A Śūdra committing adultery with a woman of any
of the three higher castes shall suffer capital punishment.’

Do. (2-26.20).—‘If a man has actually committed adultery, his organ
shall be cut off, together with the testicles.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (21.1-5).—[(See under
372.)]

*Yājñavalkya* (2.286, 294).—‘If one has intercourse with a woman of the
same caste as himself, he shall be punished with the highest fine; if
with a woman of a lower caste, with the middle fine; if with a woman of
a higher caste, he shall be put to death and the woman’s ears and nose
shall be cut off. If a Caṇḍāla has intercourse with an Ārya woman, he
shall be put to death.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.40-43).—‘An adulterer shall be made to pay the highest
amercement, if he has had connection with a woman of his own caste;—for
adultery with a woman of a lower caste, the middle amercement. He who
has had connection with a woman of one of the lowest castes shall be put
to death;—as also for having connection with a woman of the highest
caste.’

*Nārada* (12.78).—‘Intercourse is permitted with a wanton woman who
belongs to another than a Brāhmaṇa-caste, or a prostitute, or a female
slave, or a female not restrained by her master; if these women belong
to a lower caste than oneself; but with a woman of a superior caste
intercourse is forbidden.’

*Bṛhaspati* (23.12).—‘The highest fine shall he inflicted for connection
with a woman of equal caste; half of that, for connection with a woman
of inferior caste; but a man who has connection with a woman of superior
caste shall be put to death.’

*Yama* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 395).—‘If a Śūdra has connection with a
Brāhmaṇa woman, the King shall put him to death on a heated iron-bed,
burning the sinful man there with wood, leaves and grass.’
