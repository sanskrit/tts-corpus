This rule does not apply to the case of the wives of dancers and singers, or of those who make a living of themselves; for these men secretly bring their women into contact (with other men), and tempt them on.—(362)

The aforesaid prohibition regarding conversing with women does not apply
to the case of ‘*wives of dancers and singers*’;—the term ‘*cāraṇa*’
standing for dancers, singers and other actors.

So also in the case of those ‘*who make a living of
themselves*,’—*i.e*., those wives who live upon their own beauty;—the
term ‘*jīviṣu*’ qualifying the masculine noun ‘*dārāḥ*’ (wives). Or
‘themselves’ may stand for ‘wives,’—the wife being half the self of the
man; and the term stands for *those who live upon their wives*;—*i.e.,
those who condone the presence of paramours for their wives*.

‘*Bring into contact*,’—unite their wives with other men.

‘*Secretly*,’—*i.e*., not in the open market-place. These women differ
from public prostitutes in this that they carry on their intrigues
within their own homes.

‘*Tempt them on*,’—eg g them on to actual sexual intercourse; enticing
the men by means of glances and jokes.

‘*Bringing into contact*’ implies *connivance*, while ‘*tempting*’
implies leading on to the actual act.

Or, the meaning may be that ‘they bring into contact, unite, their own
wives, and seduce, through their wives, the wives of other men’; *i.e.,
they* make their wives act as prostitutes as well as go-betweens.—(362)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 387), which adds the
following notes:—In the case of the wives of *Cāraṇas* and other people
of that class, and also in that of the wives of those who make a living
by ‘their own’ (wife’s beauty),—the aforesaid rule prohibiting
conversation, or that prescribing the punishment for conversing, does
not apply,—because it is the business of these people to help their
wives to come in contact with other men, and themselves to bring about
their intercourse in secret.’

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.285), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* has the
following notes:—‘The said rule is not applicable to cases where
conversation is held with the wives of actors, singers and people of
that class who make a living by the beauty of their own (wives), *i.e*.,
those who permit other men to have intercourse with their *wives*,—the
wife being called ‘*ātman*,’ in accordance with the dictum that ‘the
wife and son of a man are his very *self*,’—‘for the purpose of making
money, and help their wives to meet other men, and even connive
secretly—showing as if they did not see it—at other men coming to their
wives.’

It is quoted in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 174), which has the following
notes:—‘*Cāraṇa*,’ dancer,—‘*ātmopajīvin*’ is the professional actor,
who makes a living by his ‘*ātman*,’ *i.e*., his *wife*,—these two
clashes of men deck up their wives for the purpose of entrapping young
men, and hence conversation with their wives is not to be penalised,
though intercourse with these also is to be punished;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 156a).

**(verses 8.362-363)  
**

*Baudhāyana* (2.4.3).—‘Corporal punishment shall not be inflicted for
adultery with the wives of minstrels and play-actors; for their husbands
themselves either actually lead them to other men, or concealed at home,
permit them to hold culpable intercourse.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.293).—‘For approaching a female ascetic, the fine is
twenty-four *Paṇas*.’
