<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The sin accruing from false evidence relating to the water—much or
little—contained in wells, tanks and other reservoirs—is similar to that
in the ease of land.

‘*Sexual enjoyment of women*’;—*i.e*., in answer to the question—‘by
whom has this woman been ravished sexually.’

‘*Water-born gems*,’—such as the pearl;—‘*granitic gems*’—the emerald
and the like;—the term ‘*gems*’ being construed both ways. There are
various kinds of gems, waterborn and granitic; hence all that was
necessary was to mention the ‘*gems*’ only; and the mention of the
qualifying epithet must he taken only as serving the purpose of filling
up the metre.

‘*Water-born*’—produced in water.

‘*Granitic*’—formed from stones.—(100)
