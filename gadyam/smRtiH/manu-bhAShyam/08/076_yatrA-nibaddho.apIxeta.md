Even though not put down as a witness, if a person happens to see or hear anything in regard to a case,—when he comes to be questioned about it, he should speak out exactly as he has seen or heard it.—(76)

“Under verso 74 it has been already declared that even though a man may
not have been originally appointed as a witness, his evidence, as
bearing upon what is directly known to him, is admissible; what then is
the use of saying again that ‘*even though not put down*, etc., etc.’?
What additional information is provided by this verse?

People might be led to think that—‘when a man has been put down as a
witness on the original document, his evidence is admissible as a matter
of course,—but not so that of one who has not been so put down,—for if
both were admissible, then there would be no point in entering any
witnesses upon the document.’ It is with a view to set aside this idea
that the author has added the present verse. The former verse refers to
cases where no witnesses have been put down, while this refers to a case
where the document is duly attested by witnesses.

‘*Not put down*’—not entered in the document.

‘*Seeing*’ and ‘*hearing*’ have been already explained.

The rest is clear.—(76)

‘*Anibaddhaḥ*’—‘Not entered as a witness in the document’
(Medhātithi),‘—but accidentally present at the transaction’ (Kullūka,
Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vyavahāratattva* (p. 26);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(28a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 46a), which explains
‘*anibaddhaḥ*’ as ‘not cited or entered.’

*Viṣṇu* (8.12).—‘An appointed witness having died or gone abroad, those
who have heard the tacts from him may give evidence.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.392).—‘A person present in court must depose truly as
to what he has seen or heard, when asked, even though he may not have
been cited as a witness.’

*Nārada* (1.161).—‘He who, without having been appointed to ho a
witness, comes of his own accord to make a deposition, is termed a *spy*
in the law-books; he is unworthy to bear testimony.’

Do. (1.166).—‘If a witness dies or goes abroad after having been
appointed, those who may have heard his statement may give evidence; for
indirect proof makes evidence.’
