पूर्वोक्तस्य जानपदादेर् धर्मस्य दृष्टादृष्टतानेन प्रदर्श्यते । **स्वानि कर्माणि** कुलस्थित्यनुरूपाणि ये कुर्वन्ति ते दूरस्था अपि **प्रिया भवन्ति** । सर्वस्यान्यो निकटवर्ती संसर्गातिशयात् प्रियो भवति । स्वकर्मकारी तु दूरस्थ एव प्रियः । **स्वे स्वे कर्मण्य् अवस्थिता** इत्य् अनेन परकर्माननुष्ठानम् आह । ये न परकर्माणि कुर्वन्ति ते सर्वस्य प्रिया भवन्तीति श्लोकार्थः ॥ ८.४२ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse shows that the aforesaid ‘local’ and other laws serve both
visible (temporal) and invisible (spiritual) purposes.

‘*Their respective occupations*,’—in accordance with the condition of
their families;—the men who follow these^(‘)*come to be liked*.’ As a
rule it is only men living near each other that come to be liked; but
the man who follows his own occupation is liked also when he is at a
distance.

‘*While they remain firm in their own duties*’;—this stands for not
encroaching upon the work of other persons;—the meaning of the verse
being that—‘those who do not encroach upon the work of others come to be
liked by all men.’—(42).
