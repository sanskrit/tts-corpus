Even though set free by the master, the Śūdra is not released from service; since that is innate in him, and who can release him from it?—(414)

Even though ‘*set free*’ by the master to whom he belongs, by the seven
modes of slavery,—*i.e*., even though emancipated by him.

Service is ‘*innate in him*,’— is in the very nature of his caste.

Who can therefore release the *Śūdra* from servitude? Just as the
Śūdra-caste cannot be removed from him, so also servitude.

This is purely declamatory; since it is going to be declared later on
that under special circumstances, the Śūdra does become released from
*servitude*.—(414)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 146), which adds the
following:—Even through the favour of the owner of the Śūdra-slave,
there is no freedom for the latter from the lowest service or slavery.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 786);—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (97a),
which explains the meaning as that howsoever favourably inclined he may
be towards either the borne Śūdra or to the bought slave, cannot absolve
him from servitude.

414	A Sudra, though emancipated by his master, is not released from servitude; since that is innate in him, who can set him free from it?
