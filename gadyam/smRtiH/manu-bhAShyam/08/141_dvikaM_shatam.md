‘*Two in the hundred*’,—*i.e*., for each hundred an interest of two is
paid.

This rule permitting an interest of two per cent, is for that
money-lender who, having a large family, is unable to maintain them if
he charges only the rate laid down in the preceding verse.

The term ‘*monthly*’ (of the preceding verse) has to be construed with
this also.

‘*Remembering, etc*.’;—all this is merely commendatory. The meaning is
that the taking of this interest also is within the province of the
conduct of good men; so that by charging it one does not lose his
righteousness.

The author proceeds to show that such a money-lender is not regarded as
greedy of wealth—‘*He does not incur the sin of extortion*’; the sin
involved in unlawfully taking what belongs to another is called ‘the sin
of extortion’; and he who does such an act is said to ‘*incur the sin of
extortion*.’—(141)

This applies to debts not secured by a pledge—say Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda;—according to Medhātithi this higher rate is permitted for
those who have a large family to support and hence require a huge income
from their loan-transactions.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 349), which adds that
‘*Dvikam*’ means *two Purāṇas*;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 8);—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 420), which explains ‘*Dvikam*’ as
*Purāṇas*;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (81a).
