‘*Commodities*’— goods, such as clothes, grains and so forth; when carts
are laden with these, they should be made to pay the ferry-toll, in
accordance with their ‘value.’ If they are laden with doth and other
things of great value, they should pay heavily; while if they are
carrying only grains and other cheap things, they should pay less.

Similarly the toll to be paid may be regulated in accordance with the
lesser or greater difficulty involved in crossing a particular river.

Carts not laden with commodities may pay ‘some *little trifle*’—*i.e*.,
a *paṇa*.

The term ‘*commodity*,’ ‘*bhāṇḍa*,’ here stands for *riches*.

Those men who are without any luggage shall pay, not half of the
*quarter-paṇa* (as laid in 404), but any little trifle, more or less;
and no bard and fast rule can be laid down on this point. Such is the
sense of the scriptures.—(405)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.263), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* has the
following notes:—Carts laden with merchandise should be made to pay
according to the value of the merchandise they carry; those that are
empty as also ‘*aparicchadāḥ*,’ poor persons, may be made to pay some
little amount.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 834), which has the following
notes:—Carts laden with merchandise should each pay according to the
value of the merchandise carried; when they are empty, they may pay a
small amount; so also persons without accoutrements.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 270), which adds the
following explanations:—Carts laden with merchandise should be made to
pay in accordance with the large or small value of the merchandise
carried; empty carts and poor persons may pay some amount smaller than
the eighth part of a *paṇa*. It adds that the rule applies to river-
*crossings*. For voyages by river the rates are different (see next
verse).
