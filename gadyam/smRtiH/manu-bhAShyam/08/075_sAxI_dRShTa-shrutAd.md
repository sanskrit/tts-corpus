<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The present verse describes the results accruing to the witness who
deposes falsely.

The term ‘seen and heard’ is synonymous with ‘apprehended,’ as has been
already explained; ‘*apart from this*’ is what *is not apprehended*, or
known to him;—if he asserts any such thing, ‘*in an assembly of noble
men*,’—in the court consisting of honourable persons,—he ‘*falls
downwards*’—headlong—‘*into hell*’—to a place where he undergoes
punishments at the hands of the god Yama;—‘*after death*’—‘and *becomes
shut out from heaven*,’—*i.e*., falls down. That is, even though he may
have committed deeds entitling him to go to heaven, yet he becomes shut
out from it, by virtue of the more serious nature of the sin of perjury.
It is not that the ‘*Karma*’ calculated to carry him to heaven is
destroyed by this sin; since every act is conducive to the fulfilment of
its own reward (and does not interfere with that of others), with the
sole exception of the Expiatory Rites (which have no results of their
own, and only tend to nullify those of the corresponding sinful
acts).—(75)

‘*Saṃsadi*’—‘In the Court’ (Medhātithi);—‘in an assembly of Brāhmaṇas’
(Govindarāja).

‘*Svargāt hīyate*’—‘Falls off from heaven which he may have earned by
meritorious acts’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and Nandana);—‘even
after passing through hell, he cannot get into heaven’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 200);—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (38a).

*Gautama* (13.7).—‘Heaven is the reward of witnesses, if they speak the
truth; in the contrary case, hell.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.19.14-15).—‘If the witness rightly recollects the facts
of the case, he will receive commendation from the most eminent men;—in
the contrary case, he will fall into hell.’

*Āpastamba* (2.29.9-10)—‘If he tells an untruth, hell will he his
punishment after death;—if he speaks the truth, his reward will be
heaven and the approbation of all beings.’

*Viṣṇu* (8.14).—‘Witnesses are free from blame, if they give true
evidence.’
