The King who imparts security is ever to be honoured; his sacrificial session constantly prospers, accompanied as it is by the gift of ‘security.’—(303)

‘*Security*’—from thieves and such dangers, as also from his own
officers, who are prevented from inflicting undue punishments.—He who
‘*imparts*’ such security ‘*is to be honoured, ever*’; *i.e*., even in
ordinary conversation, and also when he happens to retire to the forest
on having lost his kingdom.

‘*Sacrificial session*,’—a particular form of sacrificial performance,
such as the *Gavāmayana* and the like—‘*prospers*’—becomes accomplished
in all its details; this is what is meant by the ‘prospering’ of the
sacrifice.

What is meant is that the king acquires every day the merit that is
obtained by the due performance of the sacrificial session.

‘*The gift of security*.’—In other sacrificial sessions there is no gift
or fee; the act here referred to however is superior to them all, in as
much as it is accompanied by a gift, and the gift too is not in the form
of cows and horses and the like, but of a totally different form; hence
it is only right that it should be regarded as superior to the
sacrificial session—(303).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 293), which adds that this
act is called ‘*Sattra*’ on the ground of its having to be done day
after day; and ‘*abhaya-dakṣinām*’ means ‘*Sattra* at which security is
the sacrificial fee’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 124).

303	That king, indeed, is ever worthy of honour who ensures the safety (of his subjects); for the sacrificial session (sattra, which he, as it were, performs thereby) ever grows in length, the safety (of his subjects representing) the sacrificial fee.
