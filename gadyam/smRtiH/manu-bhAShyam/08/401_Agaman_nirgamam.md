The vendors in the market should not he allowed to fix their prices at
their own will; nor should the king buy things at his own arbitrary
price. What should be done then? This is what should he done:—‘*Source*’
from where a certain commodity comes, from a near or a remote
country;—so also ‘*destination and detention*’—whether it is going to be
sold immediately, or will have to be kept? When a commodity is sold
immediately, even a small profit comes very useful, as the profit can he
invested in some other commodity and thus bring in another profit;—while
from ‘detention,’ both ‘profit and loss’ are possible—and how much more
profit will the detention bring in, and what amount of loss it would
involve,—all this should be taken into consideration by the king, who
should then regulate the sales and purchases in his realm; and the
prices should be fixed in such a manner that there may be no oppression
caused to the traders, or to the buyers.—(401)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 301), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Āgamam*,’ the import of foreign commodities from
countries either remote and inaccessible, or proximate and easily
accessible—‘*nirgamam*,’ export of commodities of the country to the
said foreign countries;—‘*sthānam*,’ the determining of the expenses
incurred in the storing of the commodity during the larger or shorter
interval between its purchase and sale;—similarily ‘*vṛddhikṣayam*,’ the
profit or loss actually accrued;—‘*vicārya*,’ having fully considered
all this,—the king shall so regulate buying and selling that there may
be no undue profit or loss to the traders.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 827);—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
942).

**(verses 8.401-402)  
**

*Yājñavalkya* (2.251-253).—‘Sales should be carried on according to the
prices fixed by the King day by day; whatever profit accrues from such
sale is lawful for the trader. In the case of commodities purchased in
the country itself, the merchant shall take a profit of 5 per cent.; and
in that of those imported from outside, 10 per cent.; this rule applies
to commodities bought and sold quickly. The King shall consider the
intrinsic value of the merchandise and the cost incurred in its
marketing and then fix a price which shall be favourable alike to the
vendor and the vendee.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 302).—‘Fixing of weights and
measures, and the fixing of the price of commodities shall be placed in
charge of a trustworthy official.’
