The preceding verse was supplementary to the injunction regarding the
consideration of the ‘motive’ and other things; while the present verse
*prohibits* the punishing of persons who are not guilty of any offence,
and enjoins that of those who are guilty;—and this is emphasised because
of the possibility of the king regarding punishment as futile and hence
omitting to inflict it, which would lead to much evil.—(128)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 649);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 391), as prohibiting the punishment of the innocent;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 25);—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.1), to the
effect that the non-investigation of cases as well as the wrong
investigation of them,—both bring sin upon the king;—in *Nītimayūkha*
(p. 59);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 5a).
