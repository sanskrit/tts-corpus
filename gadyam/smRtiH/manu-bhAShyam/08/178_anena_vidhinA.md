‘*This*’ refers to all that has been said above.

‘*Manner*’—method.

‘*Deciding them with the help of witnesses and other
evidence*,’—‘Deciding’ is to be construed with each of the two names
‘*sūkṣi*’ (witness) and ‘*pratyaya*’ (evidence);—‘*evidence*’ standing
for inferences and ordeals.

‘*Disputes*’—Not only the *non-payment of debts*, but others, also.

‘*Settle*,’—*i.e*., remove the differences of opinion between the
plaintiff and the defendant: and restore them to agreement.

The treatment of the ‘non-payment of debts’ has been finished. This also
is the end of all suits; victory or defeat in all of them being
adjudicated on the same lines. Even in the ‘Heads of Dispute’ that
follow there is no other means available for deciding except ‘witnesses
And the rest’; the only difference that there is is in regard to the
character of the punishment to be inflicted, whose exact nature has got
to be prescribed; and it is for this purpose that we have the following
sections; and in course of this it shall also be determined what is
meant by ‘Selling without Ownership,’ ‘Rescission of Sale’ and so
forth.—(178)

‘*Pratyaya*’—‘Inference and supernatural proof’
(Medhātithi);—‘inference, oaths and so forth’ (Govindarāja);—‘oaths’
(Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 618).
