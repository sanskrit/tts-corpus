Excepting his legal dues, in the shape of taxes, tines and duties, all
that belongs to the citizens is ‘*what ought not to be taken*’ by the
king, even though his treasury may have become depleted. But what is
legally his due,—by reason of his arranging for the security of their
life and property-even a pice of that he shall not relinquish. Since it
has been laid down that—‘the King shall increase his treasury in the
manner of the ant-hill.’—(170)

**(verses 8.170-171)**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (19.14-15).—‘Let the King not take property for his own use
from the inhabitants of the realm. Only the measures and price of such
property shall he liable to deduction by way of taxation.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.338-339).—‘If the King increases his treasury out of
his realm, in an illegal manner, he, very soon, loses his property and
becomes ruined, along with his relations. The fire arising out; of the
harassment of his people becomes extinguished only after it has consumed
the king’s family, prosperity and his very life.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do.).—‘If the King realises from his realm, in an unlawful
manner, either lines or taxes, or tolls or share of agricultural
produce, he incurs sin. The King who rules in the right maimer, without
covetousness, obtains sons and his treasury and kingdom prosper.’

*Mahāhhārata* (Do.).—‘If the King’s treasure is obtained righteously, he
rules the entire earth, even though his strength may not be great.’
