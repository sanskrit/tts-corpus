<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

But when the man, who has made the statement ‘this treasure was hoarded
by me, or by my forefathers,’ fails to prove this,—then being a liar, he
should be fined the eighth part of what his own property may be,—or a
smaller fraction of that same treasure-trove, it is not necessary that
he should he made to pay in the same metal, gold or otherwise, as that
which has been found; he may pay in some other metal of equal value to
the former; the exact amount of the fine being such as does not ruin the
culprit, and yet teaches him a lesson.

The option is based either upon the peculiarity of the attendant
circumstances of each case, or the qualities of the person concerned.
That this is so is indicated by the fact that the latter punishment is
lighter than the former one, which is excessive. Thus then, where the
man is possessed of a large property, and the treasure concerned is
small, there the fine shall not be in proportion to the latter; in this
case the fine shall be in proportion to the man’s property; the former
would be too little (to be a deterrent).—(36)

The amount of the fine depends on the circumstances of the case and the
virtues of the offender (Medhātithi),—or only on the virtues of the
offender (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 641);—and the
whole verse in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 642), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Alpīyasīm kalām*’ implies that'the fine is to be imposed in
such a manner that the entire treasure may not become absorbed,—this
being meant for those cases where the exact extent of the
entire-property is not known.

*Agnipurāṇa* (Rājadharma, 222.16).—(Same as Manu.)

*Viṣṇu* (3.64).—‘The man, who falsely claims property hidden by another
as having been hidden by himself, shall he condemned to pay a fine equal
in amount to the property falsely claimed by him.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.35).—(See under 31.)

*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 642).—‘If a man recovers his own lost
property, he shall report it to the King; and if he makes good his
claim, he shall take it; otherwise he would be suspected.’

036	But he who falsely says (so), shall be fined in one-eighth of his property, or, a calculation of (the value of) the treasure having been made, in some smaller portion (of that).
