For out of that arises the admixture of castes among people;—whence follows root-rending unrighteousness, tending to total destruction.—(353)

‘*Arising*’ means *coming into existence*, ‘*out of that*’—*i.e*., from
the act of having intercourse with the wives of other men,—there
arises—‘*admixture of castes*’—in the form of
‘half-castes’;—‘*whence*’—*i.e*., on account of whoso coming into
existence,—‘*follows unrighteousness*,’ which ‘*rends*’—destroys—the
very ‘*root*’— of the people,—in the form of rain from heaven. It is
only when righteousness prevails that rain proceeds from the sun. When,
on the other hand, the world becomes full of ‘half-castes,’ such
righteous acts as the *Rārlri* sacrifice or gifts to proper men and the
like cease to be performed; thus there being absence of gifts,
sacrifices, oblations and the like,—which form the source out of which
all corn is produced,—the said unrighteousness becomes capable of
bringing ruin to the entire world.

For this reason, taking into consideration the fact that the act would
be productive of ‘half-castes,’ and with a view to safeguard the supply
of rain necessary for corns and other things,—tho king should always
banish adulterers.—(353)
