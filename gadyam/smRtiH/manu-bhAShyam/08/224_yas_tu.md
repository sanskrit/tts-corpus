When a maiden happens to be defective, but she is not described as being
so, to the bridegroom, and is given to him without disclosing her
defects,—then, on these becoming known, the king shall punish the giver.

The term ‘*himself*’ is meant to indicate the gravity of the offence.

Such circumstances in connection with the girl as may be detrimental to
morality, to progeny, and to capacity in general are to be regarded as
her ‘*defects*’; *e.g*., such diseases as consumption and the like, loss
of virginity and so forth.

The punishment in this case is to be cither what is laid down in the
present text, or that prescribed above, under 205.—(221)
