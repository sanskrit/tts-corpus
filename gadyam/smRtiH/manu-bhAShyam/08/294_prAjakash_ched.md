When however, on account of the driver’s ineptitude, the cart turns off and causes injury, the owner shall be punished with a fine of two hundred.—(293) If the driver is a trained one, it is he that should be punished; if the driver is untrained, all the occupants of the cart should be fined a hundred each.—(294)

**(verses 8.293-294)  
**

‘*Driver*’—the man who drives the cart; his ‘*ineptitude*’ consists in
his being not trained. What is said here applies to the case where the
accident is due to this, and not to want of care; for when the driver is
a trained one, the punishment should fall on him, there being no fault
on the part of the master.

On account of the said ‘*ineptitude*,’ if the cart suddenly happens to
‘*turn off,’—i.e*., giving up the right path, swerves off either
sideways or backwards,—and should thereby cause some damage, the owner
should he fined for having employed an untrained driver.

In view of what is going to be said regarding the case ‘when a man is
killed’ (296), where diverse penalties are prescribed in accordance with
the nature of the living being injured or article damaged,—significance
cannot be attached to what is said in the present verse regarding the
fine being ‘two hundred’; all that is meant by the declaration is that
the case cited is one calling for punishment; specially as there is
nothing else (apart from the specific cases mentioned below) to which
the exact amount of fine here laid down may he taken as
applicable.—(293-294)

**(verse 8.293)**

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 863), which explains ‘*prājaka*’
as the *driver* and ‘*swāmi*’ as the man riding in the chariot;—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 530), which explains the meaning to be that, in a case
where the chariot goes astray on account of the inefficiency of the
driver, and causes hurt to some one, a fine of 200 should be imposed on
the owner of the chariot for the offence of having engaged an inept
driver;—in *Bālambhaṭṭī* (2.299) which adds the same explanation as the
one just given;—and in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 282), which adds the
following notes:—In a case where the owner of the chariot has employed
an inefficient driver, and the horses go astray by reason of the
driver’s inefficiency, and if there be any damages caused by this, then
the owner should be fined 200.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1041).

**(verse 8.294)**

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 282), to the effect that
in a case where the driver is efficient, the punishment shall be
inflicted upon him; and it explains ‘*āptaḥ*’ as ‘fully expert’;—and in
*Mitākṣarā* (2.300) which adds, that if the owner employs an expert
driver, then it is the driver that is to be punished, not the owner;—and
in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1042).
