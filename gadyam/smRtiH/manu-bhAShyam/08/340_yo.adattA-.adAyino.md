If a Brāhmaṇa seeks, even by sacrificing and teaching, to obtain wealth from one who has taken what has not been given to him,—he is just like a thief.—(340)

This text is in the form of a corollary. the meaning is that the
Brāhmaṇa who derives his livelihood from thieves should he punished like
a thief.

‘*Even by sacrificing and teaching*’;—the term ‘even’ indicates other
acts also; so that *accepting gifts* and friendly presents, etc., also
become included.

Of the *Kṣatriya* and other castes, the means of living are other than
these; such as trade and the rest. So that to their case the rule would
apply if they received the property of thieves in the course of such
transactions.

The Brāhmaṇa has been specially mentioned, with a view to prevent the
possibility of his entertaining such ideas as ‘I have acquired this by
the lawful me ms of sacrificing for the man.’

‘*Who has taken what was not given to him*’—*i.e*., the thief.

‘*Seeks to obtain*’—wishes to acquire.

If even though he may not have actually received the sacrificial fee,
yet, he should he punished like a thief, simply on the ground of his
having associated and having had dealings with a thief.—(340)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 340), which explains
‘*adattādāyin*’ as *the thief*, and adds that ‘*api*’ includes also
*gifts* and so forth;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (2.113), which remarks that if
‘proprietary right’ were something purely *temporal*, then there would
be no justification for the penalty being inflicted on the Brāhmaṇa who
acquires wealth by teaching and sacrificing for thieves, as laid down in
the present text. *Bālambhaṭṭī* has the following notes:—‘*Adattādāyin*’
means ‘one who *takes* (*ādadāti*) another’s property when it is *not
given* (*adattam*) by him’;—in ‘*yājanādhyāpanena*’ (or ‘—*nāt*’ as read
in *Mitākṣarā*) we have the causative copulative compound;—‘*api*’
includes *gift* also.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 992);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 144).

*Gautama* (12.49-50).—‘A man who knowingly becomes the servant of a
thief shall be treated like a thief;—likewise he who knowingly receives
goods from a thief or an unrighteous man.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 340).—‘Purchasers of stolen property
and accepters of gifts from thieves, as also those who lend them cover,
have been declared to be deserving of the same punishment as the thief.’
