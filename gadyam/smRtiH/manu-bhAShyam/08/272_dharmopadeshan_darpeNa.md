<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Sometimes *Śūdras*, ‘through arrogance’ due to a slight knowledge of
grammar, address to Brāhmaṇas such advice as—‘this is your duty,’—‘such
is the procedure of this rite’—‘do not do it in this manner, you who are
learned in the Veda.’ And the text lays down the penalty for such
*Śūdras*. If however a *Śūdra* has learnt things through his association
with Brāhmaṇas, and points out lapses as to proper time and place due to
forgetting the details, in a friendly manner, with such words as—‘Do not
please omit the morning time,’ ‘fulfil your duties towards the gods,’
‘satisfy the gods,’ ‘wear the cloth over your right shoulder, and not
the reverse,’—then there is nothing wrong in this.

‘*Heated*’—put into fire and hence painful.

‘*Pour*’—make it flow.

“It is right that it should be poured into his mouth, since it is with
the mouth that he offers the advice. But what is the fault of the ears?”

Their fault lies in having listened to misguided reasonings (which make
him think himself qualified for offering the advice).—(272)

*Cf*. 11.115.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 809), which adds that ‘*asya*’
stands for the *Śūdra*;—and in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 254).

*Viṣṇu* (5-24).—‘If a low-born man, through arrogance, give instruction
to a member of the highest caste, concerning his duty, let the King
order hot oil to be poured into his mouth.’

*Nārada* (15-16.24).—‘If the Śūdra is insolent enough to give lessons to
Brāhmaṇas regarding their duty, the King shall order hot oil to he
poured into his mouth and ears.’

*Bṛhaspati* (20.12).—‘A Śūdra teaching the precepts of religion, or
uttering the words of the Veda, or insulting a Brāhmaṇa, shall he
punished by cutting out his tongue.’
