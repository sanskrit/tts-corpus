<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The present text proceeds to show that in some oases, even though some
damage may be done, it is not regarded as an offence.

‘*Conveyance*’—the cart and so forth, riding on which people go on a
journey. These carts are drawn by bullocks, mules, buffaloes and such
animals. These same animals also, when ridden upon, may be taken as
meant by the term ‘*Conveyance*.’

‘*Rider*’—the driver and other persons riding in the cart.

‘*Owner of the conveyance*,’—the person to whom the conveyance belongs.

By the force of the running wheels of these carts, or by that of the
horse or other animals pulling the cart on the

road, some damage or death may be caused; and all such cases would come
under the law relating to ‘owner and keeper’ laid down in verse 229 *et
seq*. But in all these, the fault lies sometimes with the rider,
sometimes with the owner, sometimes with both, sometimes with no one;
and these details not having been dealt with on the previous occasion,
they are taken up now.

‘*Exclusions*’—*i.e*., cases where there is no punishment for the
injury; and which therefore are not regarded as offences to be
penalised.

‘*For the rest*’;—*i.e*., for cases other than those just, enumerated,
penalties are prescribed; and these are now going to be described.—(290)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 280), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Yāna*’, the chariot and the rest,—‘*yantṛ*’, the
charioteer,—‘*ativartanāni*’, ‘lying beyond punishment’, *i.e*., not to
be punished;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1040).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

**(verses 8.290-294)  
**

*Yājñavalkya* (297-299).—‘In the cases of injury caused through
quadrupeds, or through wood and bricks, or through stones, beasts of
burden or conveyances, there is no offence, if the man operating calls
out—*Move* *out* *of the* *way*;—nor does any offence attach to the
owner of the conveyance, if the injury caused by it has been due, either
to the snapping of the nose-string, or to the breaking of the yoke, or
to the cart moving backwards. In the case of tusked and horned animals
committing havoc, if the owner, though able to do so, does not check
them, he should be made to pay the first amercement; and double of this
when the man about to be injured has cried for help.’
