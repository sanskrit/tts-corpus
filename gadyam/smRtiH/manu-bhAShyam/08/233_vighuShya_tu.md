But the keeper shall not have to make good what has been taken away by
thieves openly,—if he informs his own master of it at the proper place
and time.

‘*Openly*’—publicly, with beat of drums;—when the cattle is thus taken
away by thieves, the keeper is not made to pay for it. The term ‘openly’
is meant to indicate the helplessness of the keeper; the sense being
that in a case where there are a large number of thieves, and they have
taken away the cattle by force,—the keeper is let off; specially if he
‘*at the proper time*—*i.e*., immediately—informs the master,—‘*at the
proper place*’—*i.e*., wherever the master may happen to be.

“But how could the man know whether the master was on the spot or at his
house?”

There is no force in this; even in a case where the master is not on the
spot, some substitute of his is bound to be there, who would inform the
king or his officer and would have the thieves pursued.

‘*His own*’;—this has been added for the purpose of precluding the
possibility of the information being given directly to the king. The
keeper’s own master could make every effort to recover his property—on
being informed by the keeper;—not so the king;—and further, it would be
extremely difficult for the keeper to convey any information to the king
directly.

If the keeper gives the information after the thieves have gone away
after taking the cattle,—the blame would lie with him.—(233)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 772), which explains ‘*Kilviṣī*’
(its reading being ‘*na* *pālastatra kilviṣī*,’ for ‘*na* *pālo
dādumarhati*’) as ‘blame-worthy’;—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.164) to the effect
that the keeper should not be made to pay to the owner the value of such
cattle as are carried away by thieves ‘*by force*,’ *i*.*e*., openly, by
beat of drums and so forth;—provided that he reports it to the owner at
the same time and places (this latter being added in *Bālambhatṭṭī* as
explaining the latter half of the verse);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*, (p. 81)
which explains ‘*deśe*’ as ‘place where a search could be made;’—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru*, (105a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 137a),
which explains ‘*vighuṣya*’ as ‘with a flourish of the trumpet’ and so
forth,—‘*deśe*’ as at ‘the place where the master lives’,—and *kāle* as
‘immediately after the robbery’.

*Nārada*.—(6.12, 16).—‘If a cow under the cowherd’s charge meets with am
accident, he shall struggle to save her as best he may. If he is unable
to rescue her, he shall hasten to announce the fact to his master. For
an animal seized by robbers, though he raised a cry, the cowherd shall
not be made to pay; provided he gives notice to his master at the proper
time and place.’

*Vyāsa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 172).—‘If a cattle perishes or is taken
away, when the cowherd has been captured, or during an attack on the
village, or during anarchy,—the cowherd shall not he held to blame.’
