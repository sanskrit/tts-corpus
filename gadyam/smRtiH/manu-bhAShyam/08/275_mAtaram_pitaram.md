‘*Alienating*’ means *estranging* (sowing dissension), by false
insinuations; *e.g*., when one tries to sow dissension by making such
assertions as—‘This mother of yours has no love for you, she has a great
hankering after her other son, and has secretly given him a golden
ring.’ Similarly when he sows dissension between the father and son, or
between the husband and wife, or between brothers, or between the
preceptor and disciple.

The term ‘*child*’ has been mentioned with a view to indicate the other
member in the dissension. If this were not added, the punishment would
apply only to one who would alienate the ‘mother’ from her son,—and not
to one who would alienate the ‘son’ from his mother; though ‘alienation’
is always between two parties, yet that party is spoken of as being
‘alienated’ through whom the estrangement is attempted. Under the
circumstances, if the ‘child’ were not mentioned, the punishment would
apply only to one who would ‘alienate the *mother*’ by saying—‘this son
of yours is not devoted to you, and is ill-behaved,’—and not to one who
would ‘alienate’ the *son*, in the manner described before.

Others have explained the word ‘*ākṣārayan*’ as *causing mental
suffering*; by making such statements as—‘I am going away from the
country for the purpose of acquiring learning or wealth,’—when the fear
of the going away of the son causes pain to the father and others; and
hence this should not be done.

As regards the ‘preceptor,’ so long as he is alive, one should not go
over to another, specially so long as he does not permit him to do so.
In a case where the disciple causes mental suffering to his preceptor,
by disrespect and such acts,—the man cannot escape by paying the fine of
a hundred only; as ‘disregarding of the preceptor’ has been held to be a
very serious offence.

The ‘*alienating*’ of the loving wife with children is attempted by
telling her that her husband is going to marry another woman. Similarly
that of the son with excellent qualities, by representing him to be
otherwise.

If in any way, one does not give the way to his preceptor, bis fine
shall be one hundred.—(275)

‘*Ākṣārayan*’—‘Defames, by causing dissension’ (Medhātithi),—‘accuses of
a heinous crime’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda),—‘accuses of
incest’ (Nārāyaṇa),—‘makes them angry’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.204), which (reading ‘*Śvaśuram*’
for ‘*tanayam*’) adds that this refers to cases where the wife is
*innocent* of what is said against her, and. where the mother and the
rest are even *guilty* of what is alleged. *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the
following notes:—‘*Ākṣārayan*,’ defaming,—‘*adadat*,’ not leaving in
favour of;—what *Mitākṣarā* says in regard to this rule answers the
objection taken against it by Kullūka, that some explanation should be
found for the same penalty being prescribed for insulting all the
persons mentioned here;—Medhātithi, on the other hand, adopting the
reading ‘*tanayam*,’ has explained ‘*ākṣārayan*’ as *causing dissension*
among the persons mentioned.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 149b), which explains
‘*bhrātaram*’ as ‘elder brother,’ and adds that this refers to cases
where the elders have done some mischief, and the wife has done nothing
wrong;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 295), which adds the same
note as *Mitākṣarā*;—and in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 99), which adds that
the ‘brother meant here is the *elder* one, since he is mentioned along
with the father and the rest,’ and adds that *Mitākṣarā* and other works
have declared that this refers to the wife only when she is innocent,
and to the mother and others even when they are guilty.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 250), which reads ‘*tanayam*,’ and
explains ‘*ākṣārayan*’ as ‘subjecting’ to insult—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Vyavahāra, 44b).

*Viṣṇu* (5.28)—‘He shall he fined a hundred *Kārṣāpaṇaṣ* for defaming a
*Guru*.’

*Bṛhaspati* (20.13).—‘One reviling the sister or other relations shall
pay a fine amounting to 50 *Paṇas*.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 250).—‘If one reviles the King’s
officers or elders or Brāhmaṇas, he shall be chided or beaten or
besmeared with cowdung, or made to ride a donkey, or fined to such an
extent as would cure him of his arrogance.’
