“It has been asserted that ‘the wife and the sou form one’s own body’;
what would be the punishment inflicted upon one’s self?”

It would consist of expiatory rites, austerities and charities. Whoever
does not perform his duty, or deviates from his duty, should be
punished.—(335)

This verse is qüoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 391);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 291), which adds that the father and
mother must be exceptions to this rule, as is clear from the following
Smṛti-text quoted by *Vijñāneśvara*:—‘The following are
unpunishable—Father, Mother, Accomplished Student, Priest, Wandering
Mendicant, Anchorite, &c.’ Similarly the ‘very learned man’ should not
be punished.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 628).

*Dakṣa* (Aparārka, p. 590).—‘If a man after having become a wandering
mendicant does not remain firm in his duty, he shall be banished after

*Nārada* (7.17).—‘Should a man, after entering the order of religious
ascetics, violate the duties of his order, the King shall cause him to
be branded with a dog’s foot and banish him immediately from his realm.’

*Bṛhaspati* (27.7).—‘The King should punish elders, domestic priests,
and persons commanding respect, with gentle admonition only.’

*Gautama* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 291).—‘He who is very highly
learned should not suffer corporal punishment, or imprisonment, or fine
or banishment or blame.’
