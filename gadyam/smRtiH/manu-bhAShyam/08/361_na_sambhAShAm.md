One should not converse with the wives of other men, when forbidden. If, on being forbidden, he does converse, he becomes liable to be fined one ‘suvarṇa.’—(361)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Some people think that the punishment here laid down is meant for the
case where mendicants and the rest first mentioned carry on the
conversation, even after being forbidden.

This however is not right. It has been said that these men are not to be
forbidden. Then again, how could the fine of a ‘*suvarṇa*’ be imposed
upon a mendicant?

Hence the person meant to be fined one ‘*suvarṇa*’ is one who, even
though not previously accused, has been forbidden by the woman’s
husband, and yet goes on conversing with her.—(361)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 386);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1011);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 173),
which explains ‘*niṣiddhaḥ*’ as ‘forbidden by the husband or other
relatives of the woman.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.285).—‘If a man converses with a woman who has been
forbidden to do so, the woman shall be fined one hundred, and the man,
two hundred; if both have been previously forbidden, the punishment for
conversing shall be the same as in adultery.’

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 856).—‘A mendicant male or female, a
player,—if these enter the residence of women, after being forbidden,
they shall be fined two hundred; and the man who may have admitted them,
or who affords them the opportunity for entering, shall be punished like
an adulterer.’
