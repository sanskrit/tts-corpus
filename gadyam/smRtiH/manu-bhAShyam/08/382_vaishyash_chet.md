If a Vaiśya approaches a protected Kṣatriya woman, or the Kṣatriya a Vaiśya woman,—both these deserve the same punishment as that in the case of an unprotected Brāhmaṇa woman.—(382)

It has been said above (in 376) that in the case of approaching an
unprotected Brāhmaṇa woman, the Vaiśya ‘should be committed with five
hundred and the Kṣatriya with one thousand.’ So in the present case also
the fine for the *Vaisḥya* would be five hundred.

The heavier punishment for the *Kṣatriya* is justified on the ground
that being entrusted with the task of protecting the people, if he takes
to offending against them, he incurs a great sin.—(382)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 393), which remarks that
‘*daṇḍa*’, ‘punishment,’ meant here is the ‘middle amercement’;—in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 106);—in *Aparārka* (p. 857), which remarks that
the meaning is that in the case of the Vaiśya having intercourse with an
unguarded Kṣatriya woman who is entirely corrupt, the fine is 500; while
if the woman is guarded and chaste, then death-penalty;—if the woman
belongs to the same cāste as himself, the penalty is the ‘highest
amercement.’

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.286);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p.
319), to the effect that between the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya, if one has
recourse to the woman of the other caste, the penalty is a fine of 1,000
and 500 *paṇas* respectively;—and in *Vīramitrodya* (Vyavahāra 156a).

382	If a Vaisya approaches a guarded female of the Kshatriya caste, or a Kshatriya a (guarded) Vaisya woman, they both deserve the same punishment as in the case of an unguarded Brahmana female.
