‘*What ought not to be taken*’ is that which he is not entitled to
receive; the verbal affix denoting *title*.

‘*Weakness becomes proclaimed*’—*by* his subjects, who say—‘This king
punishes us, but he is unable to suppress thieves, robbers and
recalcitrant tributary kings’; his enemies also assert their power; and
being attacked by these, ho becomes disgusted with life and thus
‘*becomes ruined here*’—in this world—and by taking what he ought not to
take—*i.e*., by imposing illegal fines, etc.—he ‘*becomes ruined, after
death*’ also.—(171)
