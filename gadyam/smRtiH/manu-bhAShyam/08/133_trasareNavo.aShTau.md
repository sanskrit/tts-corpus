The gradually ascending measures are now described.

The term ‘*likṣā*,’ ‘*louse*’ does not stand for the sweat-born insect,
when it is said that ‘three Louse-eggs make one Black Mustard’; what is
meant is that the three of the measures known as the ‘Louse-egg’ make
one of that particular measure which is known as ‘Black Mustard.’ This
meets those objectors who argue that the ‘barley-grain,’ etc., that we
see are not found to be exactly of the same size as those described
here. Because the measure here described is not of the barley and other
*grains*; what is meant is that these terms constitute the names of
those particular measures. The subject has been introduced also with the
words—‘I am going to describe the *measures*.’

The ‘*Triad*’ is an object whose measure is fixed; and through this
Triad all the other measures are to be determined. Clever men are
capable of forming compounds of ‘Triads’; so that the text has not put
forward anything impossible or unknown. What is here described becomes
clear by referring to the opinions and ideas current among goldsmiths.
In fact the details of the subject can be ascertained only by referring
to them.—(133)
