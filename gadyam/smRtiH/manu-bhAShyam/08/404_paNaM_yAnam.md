<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

At a river-crossing, a ‘*cart*’—a conveyance, in the form of a chariot
and other things,—should pay one ‘*paṇa*.’ This is the king’s tax to be
paid by all carts that come in loaded with commodities and go out again
after having delivered these commodities, for bringing in another
supply.

‘*One man’s burden*’—when one man’s load of commodities is brought in,
the duty payable is *half-paṇa*.

‘*Animal*’— bullock, buffalo and the like;—as also a ‘*woman*’—should
pay a *quarter-paṇa*.

‘*The unloaded man*,’— who is carrying no load, should be made to pay
half of the *quarter-paṇa*. A small toll is levied from the unburdened
man, since he can cross the river by himself, and hence the help
accorded to him is comparatively small. While a woman, who is unable to
cross by herself, is made to pay more.

‘*On a ferry-crossing*’— for the purposes of crossing.—(404)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p, 270), which adds
the following notes:—This rule applies to the case of *unladen*
carts;—an empty cart, for crossing a ferry, should be made to pay one
*paṇa*;—a man with load, one-half of a *paṇa*, cattle and women, a
quarter *paṇa* and a man without load the eighth part of a *paṇa*.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 834), which adds the following
explanatory notes:—The *Pālki* and such conveyances, for crossing a
ferry, should be made to pay one *paṇa*,—a man should pay one-half of a
*paṇa*,—cattle and woman should pay a quarter *paṇa*,—as also a man,
with only his two hands, *i.e*., without any load.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 640), which adds that ‘*yānam*’
here stands for the *empty chariot*, and so forth;—‘*pauruṣaḥ*’, load
carried by one man,—‘*pādārdham*’, the eighth part of a *paṇa*.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.263), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* has the
following notes:—An empty cart should pay a *paṇa*,—a man with a load,
one-half of a *paṇa*,—cattle and woman (with the exception of those
specified below in 407) a quarter *paṇa*; and a man without load, the
eighth part of a *paṇa*. It adds that this refers to river-crossings;
the rates for sea-voyages are different.

**(verses 8.404-406)**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (19.21, Vivādaratnākara, p. 639).—‘The toll for crossing a
river whose width is within an arrow-reach is 8 *māṣas*; for crossing a
river whose width is more than an arrow-reach is a quarter of a
*Kārṣāpaṇa*; and that for crossing a river in which there is scanty
water, it is one *māṣa*; it is to be one and a half times these in the
case of women...... If a man swims a river-crossing, he should he made
to pay a sum hundred times of the toll.’
