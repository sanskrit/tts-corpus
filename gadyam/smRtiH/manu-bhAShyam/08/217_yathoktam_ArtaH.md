If the employer does not dismiss the man, when he has fallen ill, after
having paid off his wages for the part of the work done,—then he should,
after recovery, be made to finish the work. But if the employer should
say—‘I have no work for you,’ then he should receive his wages in
accordance with the part of the work that he may have done.—(217)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 797), which explains
‘*Yathoktam*’ as ‘as agreed upon’;—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.198), to the effect
that—‘if the man,—on recovery, if he has been ill, or even while he is
in perfect health’,—does not complete the task of which only a little is
left undone,—either himself or through some one else,—then he should not
be given any wages at all—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (102a), which explains
‘*kārayet*’ as ‘gets it done by another person’, and ‘*alponasyāpi*’ as
‘even though only a very little be wanting in the completion of the
work.’
