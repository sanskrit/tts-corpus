If, at a festival where twenty twice-born men are invited, a Brāhmaṇa does not entertain his frontal and back neighbours, who are quite worthy,—he deserves to be fined one ‘māṣa.’—(392)

‘*Veśa*’ is that where people live, a dwelling-house; the house that is
in the front of one’s house is ‘*prativeśa*’; and he who lives in that
is the ‘*prativeśya*,’ ‘*frontal neighbour*’ If we read ‘*prātiveśya*,’
we would add the reflexive affix ‘*aṇ*.’ Similarly ‘*anuveśya* ‘is one
dwelling at the back of one’s house.’

Persons occupying houses on the two sides also are called ‘neighbours’;
hence the two terras ‘*prativeśya*’ and ‘*anuveśya*’ may be taken as
standing for persons occupying houses next, and on both sides, to one’s
own house.

If the man does not entertain these two, after having invited them to
the ‘*festival*’ in his house, in the shape of marriage and the
like,—‘at which *twenty other twice-born persons are invited*,’—then he
should be made to pay a fine of one ‘*māṣa*.’ That this ‘*māṣa*’ is to
be of gold is indicated by its being distinctly specified in another
place.

‘*Worthy*’;—if the frontal and back neighbours are both worthy,—*i.e*.,
neither inimical, nor absolutely unqualified.—(392)

‘*Prativeśya-anuveśya*’—‘Neighbour living in front—neighbour living at
the back’ (Medhātithi);—‘the next neighbour and the neighbour next to
him’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghvānanda).

‘*Māṣakam*’—‘Of gold’ (Medhātithi);—‘of silver’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 358), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kalyāṇe viṃśatidvije*,’ ‘at which twenty Brāhmaṇas
are entertained’;—at such a festival if one does not feed his front
neighbour and back neighbour,—both of whom are perfectly fit persons for
being entertained,—he should be fined one ‘*Māṣa*’ which should be
understood to be of *silver*, in view of the fact that Manu in the next
verse prescribes the *golden* ‘*māṣa*’ as the fine for the offence of
not feeding the neighbours at a rich entertainment.

**(verses 8.392-393)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (5.94-96).—‘A fine of 25 *Kārṣāpaṇas* should he inflicted for
neglecting to invite at a *śrāddha*, a Brāhmaṇa neighbour; also for not
offering him food after inviting him. He who, after having accepted an
invitation, does not eat, shall pay a fine of a gold Māṣaka to the King,
and double the quantity of food to the inviter.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.263).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa omits to invite his neighbours, he
shall be fined 15 *Paṇas*.’

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 835).—‘If a twice-born who is in the habit
of accepting gifts, fails to attend an invitation, he should be made to
pay a fine of 108.’

392	A Brahmana who does not invite his next neighbour and his neighbour next but one, (though) both (he) worthy (of the honour), to a festival at which twenty Brahmanas are entertained, is liable to a fine of one masha.
