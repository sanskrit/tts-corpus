महांभांसि **तडागानि** । **वाप्यः** पुषकरिण्यः । **उदपानानि** कूपप्रभृतीनि । **प्रस्रवणान्य्** उदकस्यन्दा ईषत्स्रवदुदका भूप्रदेशाः । **देवतायतनानि** यक्षगृहादीनि । एतानि प्रकाशकानि । न ह्य् एतानि स्वल्पेनायासेन नाशयितुं शक्यन्ते । नाश्यमानेषु च महान् प्रत्यवायो भवति । सर्वस्य चोदकार्थिनो देवतादर्शनार्थिनश् च तत्र संनिधानात् सुज्ञातश् च साक्षिणां सीमासंधिर् भवति ॥ ८.२५० ॥

‘*Tanks*’—large reservoirs of water.

‘*Ponds*’—pools.

‘*Water-reservoir*’—wells and the like.

‘*Fountains*’— plots of ground from which small quantities of water
trickle out.

‘*Temples*’—houses for the worshipping of *Yakṣas* and other demi-gods.

All these are such marks as are publicly visible; and cannot be easily
obliterated; specially as the destroying of these entails a great sin;
and further, since all men desiring to fetch water, and to visit the
deity in the temple, are constantly on the spot, the boundary-line
becomes well known to witnesses.—(248)
