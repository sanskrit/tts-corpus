‘*Kusīda*,’ ‘*monetary loans*’—the advancing of money for earning
interest; or the money advanced may itself be called ‘*Kusīda*’; *i.e*.,
the money which is advanced with the idea ‘having advanced a small
amount I shall get back a larger amount.’

The interest on such loans ‘*shall not exceed the double*—the creditor,
having advanced the money to the debtor, shall receive from him only
such an amount as may be the double of his principal.

“What the text says is that the interest should become ‘Double’; and
this, along with the principal itself, should make the total amount
received *thrice* the principal.”

It is not so; in the term ‘*Dviguṇa*,’ ‘double,’ the term ‘*guṇa*’
signifies *part*; and when we come to look out for a *whole* of which it
would be the ‘*part*,’ it is the *principal* which, from the context,
appears to us as the ‘whole.’ Hence when the text speaks of the
‘double,’ what is meant is the double of the capital advanced. To this
end we have other Smṛti-texts—(*a*) ‘When there is delay, the capital
advanced shall become doubled’ (Gautama, 12. 81); and (*b*) ‘The deposit
is to be redeemed when the principal has become doubled’ (Yājñavalkya,
Vyavahāra, 64).

‘Interest’ is paid in several forms:—(1) when coins are advanced,
interest is paid in coins; (2) sometimes it is paid in the form of
progeny; as in the case of female cattle; (3) sometimes in the form of
the use of pledges, in the shape of cattle, land and the like.

The doubling of the interest is, according to some people, meant to
pertain to those cases where the interest paid is of the same kind as
the capital advanced; and the reason for this lies in the fact that it
is only in such cases that the exact ‘double’ can be ascertained; while
in the case of interest in the form of ‘progeny’ of animals, it cannot
be ascertained whether the ‘doubling’ is to be computed by *number*, or
size or measure; as in the case of such animals as elephants and horses,
it is found that when they are bought or sold, their price depends upon
their size; as a rule animals of larger size fetching higher prices.

“There is similarity of kind in the *progeny* also; the progeny of the
cow is of the same species as the cow. So that there is no justification
for any distinction as that into (*a*) ‘interest of the same kind’ and
(*b*) ‘progeny.’”

The answer to this is as follows:—‘Sameness of kind’ does not depend
only upon belonging to the same species; in fact it depends upon
similarity of age, size and other factors. Hence the distinction is
quite correct. Further, in the case of interest in the form of the *use
of deposits* also, how would the ‘double’ be determined? And when cows
and lands are pledged, the benefit derived from the use of the cow is in
the form of *milk*, while in the case of land, it is in the form of
fodder and other produce; so that in these cases also what sort of
‘double’ would there be? In actual usage it is found that if the
principal gold is not paid, land continues to be used and enjoyed for
hundreds of years. Says Yāyñavalkya (*Vyavahāra*, 90)—‘The pledge
continues to be enjoyed so long as the capital is not paid off.’ \[From
all this it is dear that the limit of ‘double’ cannot he applicable to
all cases.\]

Our answer to this explanation of some people is as follows:—When what
is asserted is the ‘doubling’ in regard to ‘interest’ in general, how
can we restrict it to any particular kind of interest only? When the
words of the text afford a certain meaning in a general form, we cannot
restrict it to any particular case, unless there is some authority for
doing it. As regards the argument that “there can be no *doubling*,’ in
the case of *progeny*,”—ju st please make an effort to understand the
matter: when an animal is pledged, its value is duly determined, and
certainly the value of its progeny also could be similarly determined.
Similarly in the case of the enjoyment of landed property also, when the
fodder and grains become ripened, it can he easily determined when their
value becomes equivalent to the principal.

Then again, the term ‘*Guṇa*’ (contained in ‘*dviguṇa*,’ ‘double’)
signifies *usefulness* also. “in that case what is there that would be
as *useful* as the principal?” It can always be found if a certain thing
serves any useful purpose at all. And if the interest accruing he
computed only at the price obtained from the sale of the grain and
fodder produced from the land,—then also it would be possible for the
interest to become equivalent to the principal,—even though there may be
no exact equality of size and other details.

As for the ‘local custom’ that you have put forward,—that argument has
been answered by yourself, when you called it ‘local.’ further, whenever
there is any chance of customs being abandoned, it is Smṛti-texts that
serve the useful purpose of affording the requisite check.

As regards the text—‘the pledge is enjoyed so long as the principal is
not paid up,’—the phrase ‘so long as the principal is not paid up’ can
he taken to mean ‘so long as it has not become doubled.’ In fact, with a
view to reconciling it with other Smṛti-texts, it is best to take it in
this sense. This has been fully explained by us elsewhere.

‘*Stipulated at one time*’—*i.e*., what has been fixed upon at one time,
in eases of the renewal of the loan. ‘Stipulating’ means *fixing*; and
what is settling by verbal contract is also *fixing*. The loan is
renewed, when the principal has become doubled and is not paid up. Even
after the principal has been doubled, if the creditor is willing to earn
further interest on it, and the debtor also wishes to retain the money
for the purpose of currying on some large business, he renews the deed,
entering as principal, the former principal along with the accrued
interest, and thenceforward it is on this principal that the interest
begins to accrue. And in that case, the principal, even though doubled,
continues to grow further.

It continues to grow also when transferred to another person; for
instance, when the principal has become doubled and the creditor has
need of the money and asks the debtor to pay, the latter takes him to a
third party, and says^(‘)this man will make the payment for me in so
many days’; and in this case during these additional days, further
interest shall accrue. The third party in this case is not a ‘surety’
for payment, but only a ‘trustee,’ the man who actually does the
payment. This is what has been explained by Ṛju to be the meaning of the
debt being ‘transferred to another person.’

Or. ‘transference to another person’ may refer to the following
transaction:—Even before the principal has become actually doubled, if
the pledge is banded over to another person,—when the money with accrued
interest has become doubled, then it is only right and proper that the
pledge should be redeemed; but in this case it is taken away before the
principal has reached the limit,—then, interest begins to accrue from
that date, and the limit of ‘double’ shall be computed upon the total
amount of the principal along with the interest accrued up to the date
of the transference. That is, when the creditor, with the sanction of
the debtor, hands over the latter’s pledge to a third party and receives
his due from him, then the interest continues to accrue.

In both these cases (of ‘transference to another person’), before the
doubling of the principal, the money-lender is, somehow or other, made
to agree to receive payment from another person; or, ‘transference to
another person’ may mean that case where the debtor takes a further loan
from the creditor, but having to go away to foreign lands, transfers the
loan by means of another document.

Ṛju however holds that, except in the case of the same debtor renewing
the loan, no interest beyond the doubling of the principal can accrue.
It is in accordance with this view that he has declared—‘In the case of
transference to another person, there should be renewal of the deed, and
the need for this we shall explain.’

Some people have held the following view:—“The rule laid down in the
present text refers to a case where the whole amount of interest
accruing during the year is *paid at one time* \[this being the meaning
of the phrase ‘*sakṛdāhiṭā* \]; whereas if all the interest that has
fallen due is not paid off wholly, then it will go on accruing, even
beyond the limit of ‘double the principal.’”

But in this explanation, neither the negative particle ‘*na*’ nor the
term ‘*āhita*’ retains its real meaning. For if the interest accrued
during the first year has been received, and at the end of the second
year, the interest is again brought up for payment,—where would there be
any chance of the principal becoming doubled?

“The prohibition of excess may apply to a case where the debtor brings
up for payment the amount of the principal which has become doubled with
accrued interest. Even before the principal becomes doubled, if the
debtor is able to pay up the interest only, he can do so, and there can
be no limit placed upon the principal to be accepted.”

This view also is nothing. When the debtor is ready to pay up, he
deserves favourable consideration, and he should not be made to pay
more; and if a debtor is forced by the king to pay up, it cannot be
right to remit the excess in his case. Nor does the term ‘*āhitā*’ of
the text mean this.

If the word is read as ‘*āhṛtā*,’ then the exact signification of the
term ‘*sakṛt*’ would be doubtful; reason would be scattered to the
wings, and the text would he a self-conceived one, and not the one
propounded by Manu.

From all this it follows, that the most reasonable conclusion is as
explained by us above.

In the case of grains and other things, it does not exceed the
‘*quintuple*’—*i.e*., five times.

Another Smṛti text lays down ‘quadruple’ in the case of grains:—‘In the
case of gold, cloth and grains, the interest is to be double, triple and
quadruple respectively’ (Nārada, 107). And the law on this point is as
follows: If the moneylender has become reduced to poverty, and the
debtor has become opulent with much wealth, having earned much wealth by
means of the grain he had borrowed,—then the interest is to be *five
times*; and in other cases it is to be only *four times*.

‘*Sada*’—stands for the *fruit of trees*,—‘grains’ being mentioned
separately.

‘*Lava*’—stands, among northerners, for *wool*.

‘*Beasts of burden*’—ass, camel, ox and so forth.—(151)

‘*Smṛtyantare*’—(Medhātithi, p. 967, l. 30)—see Yājñavalkya (2. 39
)—‘*Vastradhānyahiraṇyānām catustridviguṇā parā*’, and in *Nārada*
(107)—‘*Hiraṇyadhānyavastrāṇām vṛddhirdvitricaturguṇā*.’

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.39), which adds the following
notes:—Capital invested for increase is called ‘*kusīda*’,—the increase
thereof is called ‘*vṛddhi*’;—and this never goes beyond, exceeds, the
double,—if it is the first original investment; in the case of the
investment being one that has been transferred from one person to
another, it *can* exceed the double,—as it becomes, in tins case, a
fresh transaction.—If we adopt the reading ‘*āhṛtā*’ (in place of
‘*āhitā*’), the meaning would he that the amount cannot exceed the
double only in the case where the interest is paid all at one time, and
that in a case where it is paid by gradual instalments—daily, monthly or
yearly,—it does exceed the double. It goes on—‘The rule applies to cases
where the loan has been advanced in one instalment, and is also paid
back in one instalment; in cases where the loan has been transferred to
another person, or a fresh transaction is entered into by the same
parties after certain additions and subtractions, the interest does go
on accumulating even after the principal, along with the interest, has
reached the amount which is double of the original principal.—On the
second half of the verse it remarks that in the case of grains and roots
and flowers and fruits, the quantity payable may become five times of
the principal. It explains ‘*śada*’ as *agricultural products*, fruits,
flowers etc.,—‘*lava*’ as the wool of sheep, the hair of the *camarī*
cow find so forth,—‘*vāhya*’ as ‘bullocks, horses and the like.’
Interest on these cannot go beyond five times the principal.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 643), which adds that the term ‘*sakṛt*’
makes it clear that the amount can exceed the double, in a case where
with the consent of the debtor the accrued interest is added on to the
principal and a fresh transaction entered into. It adds that this
applies only to transactions in *gold*.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 76), which adds that Vijñaneśvara
and others have held that in a case where interest has been paid by
instalments at intervals, the total amount of the amount to be paid
ultimately may exceed the double.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 17), which adds the following
explanatory notes:—‘*Dhānye*’, barley, *vrīhi* and the rest,—‘*sade*’,
fruits and other products from trees,—‘*lave*’, wool of the sheep, hair
of the *Camarī* and so forth, the etymological meaning being ‘what is
shorn’, ‘*lūyate*’;—‘*vāhye*’, ‘what is *driven*’, the horse and so
forth;—if any of these things is lent, on interest, like gold and
silver,—the amount to be paid should not exceed five times the
principal. It is just possible that some one may borrow a hundredweight
of grains, or a hundred horses, on loan at the rate of 2 per cent
interest;—such a debtor, even after a very long time, can repay only
*five hundred*, not more. The present text lays down ‘five times’ as the
limit in the case of grain; but Bṛhaspati has fixed this limit at ‘four
times’; while ‘three times’ is the limit fixed by Viṣṇu, Marīci,
Vaśiṣṭha and Hārīta. In view of these alternative limits, the decision
in any particular case will have to be determined by the character of
the debtor concerned, or the nature of the time, and consideration of
scarcity or affluence.

This verse is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 18b);—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 326), which explains ‘*sada*’ as the produce of
cultivation, other than, corn,—*e.g*., fruits and other
things,—‘*vāhya*’ as ‘bullock and the rest’,—and ‘*lava*’ as ‘wool and
the like;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 11), which says that at one
transaction, in the case of gems and things of that kind also, the
interest cannot go beyond the double;—that in grains etc. it can go upto
fivefold; but in repeated transactions it can go beyond the said
‘double’; it notes the reading ‘*sakṛdāhitā*’; it explains ‘*vāhya*’
as‘bullock and the like’,—‘*śada*’ as ‘field-prodce’,—‘*lava*’ as ‘that
which is lopped off’, *i.e*., wool, except that of the sheep.

*Gautama* (12.31, 36).—‘If the loan remains outstanding for a long time,
the principal may bo doubled; after which the interest ceases. The
interest on animal-products, on wool, on agricultural produce, and on
beasts of burden shall not increase more than the live-fold value of the
object lent,’

*Viṣṇu* (6.11-14, 16, 17).—‘On gold, the interest shall rise no higher
than to make the debt double; on grain, three-fold; on cloth, fourfold;
on liquids eight-fold; on substances from which spirituous liquor is
extracted, on cotton, thread, leather, weapons, bricks, and charcoal,
the interest is unlimited; on objects other than those just mentioned,
it may be double.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.39).—‘For cattle and for women, the interest consists
in the form of their offspring; in the case of clarified butter and
other *Rasas*, the highest limit of interest is eight-fold; in that of
cloth, fourfold; in that of grains, threefold; and in that of gold,
double.’

*Kātyāyana* (Aparārka, p. 643).—‘The money-lender shall receive double
the amount lent.’

*Nārada* (1.105-107).—‘There are special rules according to the local
usages of the country where the loan has been made. In some countries
the loan may grow till the amount of the principal has been reached; in
other countries it may grow till it becomes three, or four, or eight
times as large as the principal. The interest on gold, grain and clothes
may rise to two, three, or four times the principal. On liquids, the
interest may become octuple; of women and cattle, their offspring forms
the interest.
