‘*Flowers*’—The *navamallikā* and the rest.

‘*Green com*’—while still in the field.

‘*Other unhusked*,’—‘*anyesu aparipūteṣu*’;—in as much as this has the
plural form, and ‘*husking*,’—which consists in the removing of chaff
and husks—is possible only in the case of ‘*grains*,’ we construe this
along with the term ‘*dhānyesu*,’ ‘grains,’ of the next verse. As for
‘*shrubs, creepers and trees*’ and (‘*flowers*’ which are expressed by
the only other words in the verse with the plural ending), though the
former have leaves, and the latter also are generally mixed up with
leaves, yet they are never spoken of as ‘*husked*.’

The Locative ending refers to the ‘*stealing*,’ mentioned in the
preceding verse, from where it is construed here also.

In the case of these, there shall be a fine of ‘*five kṛṣṇalas*’;—the
‘*kṛṣṇalas*’ meant being of various metals, to be determined in
accordance with the greater or less utility of the things stolen. The
ancients have held that it refers to *gold* only.—(330)

‘*Anyeṣu*’—Medhātithi does not read ‘*alpeṣu*’ as asserted by Hopkins.

‘*Pañcakṛṣṇalaḥ*’—‘Medhātithi says that the *kṛṣṇalas* meant may be gold
or silver, in accordance with the gravity of the offence’—that ‘it is
meant to be *gold* only’ is the view that he quotes as held by the
‘ancients.’ Buhler therefore is not right in attributing this latter
view to Medhātithi himself.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 325) which adds the
following notes:—‘*Harite dhānye*’, which is still lying unripe in the
field; on this being stolen for purposes of fodder ,—‘ *naga*’,
tree,—‘*alpeṣu*’ (which is its reading for ‘*anyeṣu*’), quantity even
less than what can be carried by a man,—‘*aparipūteṣu*’,
unhusked,—‘*dhānye*’, in construing the sentence the number is to be
changed into the plural, ‘*dhānyeṣu*.’
