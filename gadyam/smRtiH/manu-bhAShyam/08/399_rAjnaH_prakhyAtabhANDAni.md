Those commodities that have been ‘*proclaimed*’ to belong to the king’s
monopoly,—*e.g*. elephants in the eastern countries, saffron, silks and
woolens in Kaśmir, horses among the western countries, precious stones,
pearls, etc., among the southern countries; in fact such articles as are
easily obtainable in the dominions of the king concerned, but rare in
other countries. Kings come to a mutual understanding among themselves
regarding all such commodities.

‘*Forbidden*’—*i.e*., those in regard to which the king has ordered that
they should not he exported outside his dominions; *e.g*. during
famines, the exporting of food-grains is prohibited.

‘*Through greed*,’—if some one exports for sale such commodities to
other countries, the king shall confiscate all his property.

This punishment is meant for one who does the exporting with a view to
profiteering, if they are carried for being presented to a foreign king,
then the punishment shall be severer in the form of imprisonment and
other forms of corporeal punishment.—(399)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 300), which adds the
following notes:—Those objects that are specially fit for a king’s
use—such as large elephants, and so forth—as also those the export of
which is prohibited, such as grains and other things difficult to obtain
in the country, and hence not to be sold to foreign countries,—if,
through greed, merchants should export such articles to foreign
countries, they should have all their property confiscated by the king,
*i.e*., he should take away all that the man may have earned over the
commodity.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 817); and again on p. 834;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 174);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
954);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*, (p. 119), which has the following
explanation—‘Such elephants, horses and other things as are fit for the
king only,—and things of which all buying and selling have been
prohibited by the king,—if any one sells these in open defiance of the
royal command, all that he obtains by this selling should be confiscated
by the king.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.130).—‘He who sells a commodity on which the King has laid an

prohibited or which is fit for the King’s own use, shall go to the
King.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 301).—‘On selling a forbidden
