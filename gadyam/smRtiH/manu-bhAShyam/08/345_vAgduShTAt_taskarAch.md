<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is another declamation eulogising the injunction of punishment.

‘*Wicked of speech*’;—he who offends with words.

‘*Taskara*’ is a thief.

‘*With a staff*’— the ‘*staff*’ stands here for anything that hurts, any
weapon.

In comparison to all these three kinds of offenders, dealt with in the
three foregoing sections, the one going to be dealt with now is the
worst.—(345)

**(verses 8.345-347)  
**

*Nārada* (14-1 *et seq*.).—‘Whatever act is performed by persons
inflamed with strength is called *Violence*. Manslaughter, robbery,
indecent assault on another man’s wife, the two kinds of assault are the
four kinds of Violence. Destroying, reviling, disfiguring or otherwise
injuring fruits, roots, water and the like, or agricultural
implements............ The punishment to be inflicted for Violence shall
be proportionate to the heaviness of the crime, but it shall not be less
than a hundred.’

345	He who commits violence must be considered as the worst offender, (more wicked) than a defamer, than a thief, and than he who injures (another) with a staff.
