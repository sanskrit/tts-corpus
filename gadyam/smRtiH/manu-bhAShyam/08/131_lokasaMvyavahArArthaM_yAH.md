I am going to describe fully, for the sake of business-transactions, those technical terms that are used in the world in connection with silver and gold.—(131)


‘The dust-mote discernible in the sunbeam passing through a lattice is called Trasareṇu;— 
three Trasareṇus make one nit; 
3 nits make 1 Black mustard-seed. 
3 Black mustard seeds make 1 white mustard seed. 
6 white mustard seeds make 1 Barley-corn. 
3 Barley-corns make 1 Kṛṣṇala. 
5 Kṛṣṇalas make 1 Māṣa. 
12 Māṣas make ½ Akṣa. 
½ Akṣa plus 4 Māṣas make 1 Suvarṇa. 
4 Suvarṇas make 1 Niṣka. 
2 Kṛṣṇalas make 1 Silver Māṣaka. 
16 Silver-Māṣakas make 1 Dharaṇa of silver. 
1 Karṣa or 80 Raktikas of copper make 1 Kārṣāpaṇa. 
250 Copper Paṇas make the first or lowest amercement. 
500 Copper Paṇas make the middlemost amercement. 
1,000 Copper Paṇas make the Highest amercement.


‘One Dust-mote in the Sun’s beam makes 1 Trasareṇu, 
8 Trasareṇus make 1 Likṣā, 
3 Likṣās make 1 Rājasarṣapa (black mustard seed), 
3 Black mustard seed make 1 White mustard seed, 
6 White mustard seeds make 1 Barley-corn, 
3 Barley-corns make 1 Kṛṣṇala, 
5 Kṛṣṇalas make 1 Māṣa, 
16 Māṣas make 1 Suvarṇa, 
4 or 5 Suvarṇas make 1 Pala, 
2 Kṛṣṇalas make 1 Māṣa (silver), 
16 Māṣas (silver) make 1 Dharaṇa, 
10 Dharaṇas make 1 Śatamāna or Pala (silver), 
4 Suvarṇas make 1 Niṣka, 
Copper, ¼ Pala (gold) in weight make 1 Paṇa (copper), 
1080 Paṇas make the highest amercement, 
540 Paṇas make the middlemost amercement, 
270 Paṇas make the lowest amercement.’


‘10 Dhānya-māṣaka or 5 Guñjās = 1 Suvarṇa-māṣaka.
16 Suvarṇa-māṣakas = 1 Suvarṇa or 1 Karṣa. 
4 Karṣas = 1 Pala.
80 white mustard seeds = 1 Māṣaka (silver). 
16 Māṣaka (silver) or 20 Śambya berries = 1 Dharaṇa. 
20 Rice-grains = 1 Dharaṇa (Diamond).

*Objection*.—“Such terms as ‘*likṣā*’ (Louse-egg) and the rest,
pertaining to copper and other metals are already well known in the
world; what is the use of propounding a scriptural definition? They
could he learnt from the usage of experienced men, just as the exact
denotation of such words as ‘cow’ and the like is learnt.”

It is in view of this objection that the author has added the phrase
‘*for the sake of business-transactions*’; ‘sake’ here denotes *sphere*;
hence the meaning is that what is adopted as the basis here is usage in
actual business (and not ordinary usage).

“In that case, standing on the same footing as such words as ‘cow’ and
the like, they would he learnt from actual business-usage; what is the
use of setting forth a scriptural injunction?”

The answer to this is that the Injunction is put forth for the purposes
of restriction. There being several other such terms in use in
connection with iron, bell-metal, gold and other metals, it is with a
view to preclude these that the author has laid down the present
injunction; as also for precluding the difference in the measures, which
is met with in certain localities. For instance, in some localities, a
*pala* is regarded as made of 40 *māṣas*, while in others of 64, and in
others again of 108, and so forth. And all this diversity is precluded
and one definite measure is laid down here.

The verse is to be construed as follows—‘*these terms that are used in
the world, I am going to describe for the sake of
business-transactions*,’—so that the business-transactions of all men
may be carried on with the help of those same technical terms; and
incidentally the rules relating to these also would become
clearer.—(131)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 115);—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 665), which explains the construction as ‘those
that are generally used, these I am going to describe, explain, for the
purpose of transactions among men’;—in *Hemādri* (Vrata, p. 53);—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Dāna, p. 4a).

*Nārada* (Punishments, 57 *et seq*.).—‘*Kārṣāpaṇa* is a silver-coin in
the Southern country; in the East it is equal to 20 *Paṇas*;—a *Māṣa* is
the twentieth part of a *Kārṣāpaṇa*;—a *Kākanī* is the fourth part of a
*Māṣa* or *Pala*;—a *Kārṣāpaṇa* is equal to an *Aṇḍikā*; four *Aṇḍikās*
make one *Dhānaka*; twelve *Dhānakas* make one *Suvarṇa*, otherwise
called *Dīnāra*.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 256).—

> ‘10 *Dhānya-māṣaka* or 5 Guñjās = 1 *Suvarṇa-māṣaka*.  
> 16 *Suvarṇa-māṣakas =* 1 *Suvarṇa* or 1 *Karṣa*.

The weights are—½ *Māṣaka*, 1 *Māṣaka*, 2 *Māṣakas*, 4 *Māṣakas*, 8
*Māṣakas*, *Suvarṇa*, 2 *Suvarṇas*, 4 *Suvarṇas*, 8 *Suvarṇas*, 10

*Bṛhaspati* (Parāśaramādhava-Vyavahāra, p. 116).—‘Copper 1 *Karṣa* in
weight makes the coin called *Paṇa*, also called *Candrikā*;—4 *Paṇas*
make one *Dhānaka*;—12 *Dhānakas* make one *Suvarṇa*, also called
