‘*Who buys and sells*’—*i.e*., the trader.

‘*Who avoids the custom-house*’—by taking to unfrequented roads.

‘*At the improper time*’—at night, when the custom-officers have gone
away.

‘*Who makes a wrong statement in counting*,’—when counting the articles,
if he mentions a figure larger than the actual one. ‘Counting’ is
mentioned only by way of illustration; hence the same rule applies to
case of *concealment* also.

Such a man should be made to pay a fine ‘*eight times the amount
evaded*’;—*i.e*., eight times the value of the articles that he
conceals; or eight times the duty that he tries to evade. The former is
more reasonable; as ‘evading’ would be more applicable to the
*articles*.

Others have offered the construction—‘*who buys and sells at the
improper time*’;—this would he a prohibition of carrying on transactions
before the duty has been paid, or in secret.—(400)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 297), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Śulka*’ is the duty realised by the king on all sales
and purchases,—the ‘*sthānas*’ of this are the customs-outposts
established by the king on rivers, in cities, on mountains, and so
forth;—when themerchant reaches these out-posts, he should pay the
custom; he should never seek to avoid their payment by going by
untrodden tracks;—if with a view to avoiding customs-outposts, the
merchant should seek to carry on his sale and purchases at the improper
time—*e.g*., at night,—or if he declares his goods falsely,—then he
should be made to pay a fine which is eight times the value of the
commodity in question.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*, (p. 955).

*Yājñvalkya* (2.262).—‘A. traitor who makes a false declaration of the
measure of his commodity, or who evades the customs outpost, or who buys
and sells fraudulently, should be made to pay eight times the value of
the merchandise.’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 834).—(Same as Manu.)

*Viṣṇu* (Do.).—‘If a trader tries to evade the payment of duty he shall
have his entire goods confiscated.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do.).—‘On arriving at the customs-office the trader shall
pay the proper duty, and shall never evade it, as this is meant to be an
offering to the King.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 298).—‘The trader who uses false
weights and measures incurs the penalty of having his limbs cut off, or
some corporal punishment.’
