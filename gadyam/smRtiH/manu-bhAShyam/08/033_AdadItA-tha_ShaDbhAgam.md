Property that has been lost and found should remain in the charge of specially deputed (officials); and the thieves that he may detect in connection with this, the king shall cause to be killed by an elephant.—(33)

‘*Pranaṣṭādhigatan*’— that which has been lost and then found, *i.e*.,
at first lost and subsequently found.

‘*Should remain in charge of officials specially deputed*’—whose chief
duty is to take care of the property.

While it is thus kept, if thieves should happen to steal it,—then these
thieves the King shall cause to be killed by an elephant.

The specification of the ‘elephant’ can only he with a view to some
invisible (transcendental) result.—(33)

Which particular part of the property is to be taken by the king in any
particular case shall depend upon the length of time for which it has
been kept by the king (Medhātithi and Rāghavānanda),—or on the trouble
involved in keeping it (Medhātithi and Govindarāja),—or on the character
of the owner (Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.33), which concludes that
dining the first year, the king should hand over to the owner the entire
property, keeping nothing for the state,—during the second year he
should keep for the state the twelfth part of it,—during the third year,
its tenth part,—and during the fourth year and onwards, the sixth part;
and in every case the fourth part of the royal share should be given to
the man who found the property.—This is again quoted in the same work
under 2.173, where also the same explanation is accepted.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 778), which declares that whether the
king shall take the larger or smaller share shall depend upon the
trouble involved in the keeping of the property.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 87), which accepts the
explanation given in the *Mitākṣarā*, and adds that the rule that the
king should take the whole property after the lapse of three years is
meant for those cases where the owner of the property is not known; but
in cases where it is known that such and such an article has been
forgotten here by this or that man,—the property has to be handed over
to him, even though he may turn up after the lapse of three years.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 347), which adds the following
notes;—‘*Praṇaṣṭādhigatāt*’ means ‘out of the property that was lost,
discovered *and kept in custody*;’—the alternatives regarding the
portion to be taken by the king are based upon the amount of trouble
involved in the keeping of the property;—this rule is meant for the case
of property other than the ‘single-hoofed’ and the rest mentioned in
Yājñavalkya (2.174).

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 226);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Rājanīti, p. 265), which adds the following notes:—‘*Praṇaṣṭa*’ means
‘fallen away from the possession of the owner—if some such property has
been found by the customs-officer or other officers guarding the place,
and brought over to the king,—then out of that, if the owner should turn
up to claim it during the first year, the king should hand over to him
the whole of it,—if during the second year, he should keep for the state
the twelfth part of it,—during the third year, the tenth part, and
during the fourth year and onwards, the sixth part, adding that the
increased share is justified by the increased trouble involved in
keeping the property for a longer period.

It is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 27b).

**(verses 8.33-34)**

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 96).—‘In the case of the loss of property in the shape
of a biped, the owner shall pay five *Paṇas* as the fee; in that of
one-hoofed animals, 4 *Paṇas*; in the case of cows and buffaloes, 2
*Paṇas*; in that of small cattle, one fourth of a *Paṇa*; in the case of
gems and minor metals, five per cent, of the value.’

*Gautama* (10.36-38).—(See under 30.)

*Yājñavalkya* (2.174).—‘The owner should give to the Under 4 *Paṇas* in
the case of a one-hoofed animal, 5 in the ease of man, two in the ease
of buffaloes, camels and cows, and a fourth *Paṇa* in the case of sheep
or goat.’

*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara).—‘If a man recovers his own property that had
