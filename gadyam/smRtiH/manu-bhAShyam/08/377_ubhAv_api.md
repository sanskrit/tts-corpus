<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Both these*,’ *i.e*., the *Vaiśya* and the *Kṣatriya*—‘*offending
against*’—*i.e*., having sexual intercourse with—a protected Brāhmaṇa
woman—‘*should he punished like the Śūdra*,’—*i.e*. ‘deprived of
everything, if the woman is protected’ (as declared in 374).

‘*Or he should be burnt in a fire of dry grass*’—the term ‘or’ is meant
to indicate option in the *method of killing*, and not in regard to the
*killing* itself. Because in the case of the protected Brāhmaṇa woman,
there is no other penalty for the *Śūdra* except death—(377)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra p. 318);—in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 106);—and in *Mitāk* *ṣarā* (2.286), where
*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following notes:—If a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya have
intercourse with a guarded Brāhmaṇa woman, he should be punished like a
Śūdra, *i*. *e*., deprived of his whole body and his entire property
(according to 374); *i.e*., his entire property should be confiscated
and he should be put to death;—another alternative penalty prescribed is
that he should be put to death, without any confiscation of property;
and it is by means of the ‘*Kaṭāgni*’ that he is to be put to death.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 155b).
