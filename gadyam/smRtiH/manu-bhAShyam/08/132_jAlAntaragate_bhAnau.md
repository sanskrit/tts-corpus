<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Some people do not read this verse as part of the text, on the ground
that there is no difference of opinion regarding the ‘Triad.’

When the sun shines through a window-hole or lattice, we see a particle
of dust; it is this that is called ‘Triad.’

‘*Antara*’ means *hole*.

‘*This is the very first of measures*’— (132)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

The ‘*Trasareṇu*’, Triad,’ consists of three diads, each ‘diad’
consisting of two ‘*aṇus*’ or atoms.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 115);—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 665);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 580); in *Hemādri*
(Vrata, p. 53);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Dāna, p. 4a).
