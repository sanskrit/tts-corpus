<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

At the rite of Fire-laying the *Adhvaryu* shall take the chariot; and
the *Brahman* or the *Hotṛ* shall take the swift horse.

In certain rescensional texts, these form the ‘sacrificial fee’ for the
rite of Fire-laying.

At, the rite of ‘Soma-purchase,’ there is a cart, which is to be taken
by the *Udgātṛ*. To this cart one calf is yoked, and another unyoked:
and it is on this cart that the purchased *Soma* is carried. Others hold
that the rites laid down in connection with the ‘purchase of Soma’ have
some transcendental purpose, and their use does not lie only in the
obtaining of the *Soma*; because there is no new character produced in
the *Soma* by its being purchased in the peculiar manner prescribed.

This verse has described how the fees prescribed in connection with the
subsidiary details are to be distributed among the several persons
concerned; the next verse is going to describe the rule concerning the
distribution of the sacrificial fee prescribed in connection with all
rites in general.—(209)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 120), which adds the
following notes:—For the followers of certain recensions it is laid down
in connection with the fire-kindling rites that the Adhvaryu is to
receive the chariot the Brāhmaṇa priest a swift horse, the Udgātṛ
priest, the cart in which the Soma is carried.—‘*Kraye*’ means at the
purchase of Soma.—Hence the answer to the question raised in the
preceding verse is that the special fee prescribed for a particular
priest is to be given to that priest only; as it is only thus that the
‘*giving*’ would be done in its real sense; the mention of the priests
in the texts prescribing the fees could not but be for this perceptible
purpose; while in any other case such naming would have to be taken only
as serving some transcendental purpose.

This verse is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Vyavahāra, p. 221), to
the effect that it is only the general fee prescribed in connection with
the performance as a whole that it is to be divided among the
priests,—not so the special fee prescribed in connection with a
particular priest, who alone is to receive this latter fee;—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (90a), which says that this answers the question raised
in the preceding verse, the answer being that wherever the texts
prescribe a certain article as to be given to a particular person, it
has to be given to that person only.
