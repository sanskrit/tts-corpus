<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It has been laid down that purchases shall be made from persons not
suspected of dishonesty; hence where the seller is capable of being
produced, the rule just quoted becomes applicable; but if the m in
having sold the property goes away,—and ‘*the source*,’—the
seller—cannot be produced by the man who bought from him the property
that is now recognised by its real owner as his own,—then the purchaser
has his character cleared by the fact that he made the purchase in the
open market,—in the presence of a large number of men; and on that
account he is let off without punishment.

But the property is restored to the rightful owner, ‘*the person who had
lost it*’ and then recognised it as his own.

The term ‘*nāṣṭikaḥ*’ means *he who has lost*, derived from the
participial noun ‘*naṣṭa*’ with the possessive affix ‘*ṭhan*’ and then
the reflexive affix ‘*aṇ*’; or it may be explained as meaning ‘he who is
seeking for his lost property.’

The sense in brief is this:—In the case of a public sale, there is to be
no punishment, but the loss of the price paid remains.—(202).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 103), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Mūlam*,’ the original seller, who sold the article
which did not belong to him;—if he is ‘*anāhārya*’, incapable of being
produced by the purchaser, by reason of his being in a foreign
country;—but the purchaser is one who had made his purchase openly,—then
this latter is not to be punished;—but the actual owner shall receive
back his property which had been fraudulently sold.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 87), which reading ‘*anāhārya*’
for ‘*anāhāryam*’, explains it as ‘not producing;’—the meaning being
‘even though the buyer is unable to produce the original seller, if his
purchase is found to be *bona fide* by reason of its having been done in
public.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 776), which adds the following
explanation:—‘*Mūlam*’ is the original seller;—if he is incapable of
being produced by reason of his whereabouts being unknown.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 215), which adds that
the rightful owner is to receive his property from the purchaser, only
on paying to him one half of the price that had been paid for it;—this
opinion being based upon a clear declaration to that effect by
Kātyāyana;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 43), which adds the following
explanation:—‘Where the selling has been done openly,—and yet the
original owner proves his claim to the property concerned,—and the
property concerned is not returnable, by reason of its having been
exported to foreign lands, and so forth—then the *bona fide* purchaser
is not to be punished, but he is to be made to refund the price to the
real owner—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (86a).
