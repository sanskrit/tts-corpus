‘*Svādānam*’;—the ‘*ādā* *na*,’ ‘taking’ of his ‘*sva*,’ ‘what is his
due.’ Or it may be explained as ‘*su*’—‘good’—‘*ādāna*’—‘receiving’;
‘good’ here standing for what is proper.

‘*Adjustment of castes*,’—*i.e*., the admixture of the persons of two
castes with members of the same caste; we take it as ‘*two*,’ because an
‘admixture’ presupposes *two* relatives; and as no other relatives are
mentioned we take the ‘adjustment’ or ‘admixture’ as pertaining to
*castes*. The mixture that takes place among the subdivisions of various
castes cannot be called an ‘adjustment of the castes.’ because it does
not pertain to the ‘castes’ pure and simple.

*Ṛju* however reads a negative particle here; in which case this would
be a reiteration of the prohibition of the ‘crossing’ of castes.

Also on account of ‘*protecting the weak*’ from the ‘strong,’ when they
are suffering at the hands of these latter,—‘*the power of the king
grown*.’

The sense of all this is that.—‘The King should investigate the cases
properly, and should never inflict illegal penalties’;—and it is as a
hortatory supplement to this injunction that we are going to have a
number of passages.—(172)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 275), which adds
the following notes;—‘*Svādānāt*’, ‘by taking what is his own legally,
such as taxes and so forth’;—‘*varṇasaṃsargāt*’, ‘by marriages and such
relationships contracted by the Brāhmaṇa’ and other castes with persons
of their own respective castes’; the ‘*saṃsarga*’ of different castes is
not meant, as that would lead to the evil of ‘mixed castes.’

*Nārada* (18.5-7, 33, 43).—‘The King shall be careful to protect all
orders and the constituent elements of the state... Whenever any caste
should remain behind others, or exceed its limits,—seeing that it has
strayed from its path,—the King shall bring it back to the path of duty.
So also when other wicked acts, opposed to the dictates of the sacred
law, have been committed, the King after having reflected upon the
matter shall inflict punishment on those who deserve it... The King’s
duties are the protecting of his subjects, the honouring of the aged and
the wise, the trying of law-suits and making each caste abide by its
duties...... If a ruler, though severe, is mindful of his duty, correct
in his conduct find quick to punish the wicked and to protect the
virtuous,—his wealth is declared to he pure.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.315).—‘What he has not obtained, he should seek to
obtain lawfully.’
