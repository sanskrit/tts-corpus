This verse prescribes the punishment for one who denies what has been
deposited with him, and also for him who demands what was never
deposited. The man is to be fined that amount which would be the value
of the article in regard to which the fraud is committed.—(191)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 663);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 91), which adds the following explanation:—The depository, who, even
when asked to do so, does not surrender the deposit,—or the other party
who demands the deposit, without having delivered it,—both of these
should be punished like a thief, if the property involved is a large
one; but if it is a small one, then they have to be fined the value of
the deposit in question, and the depository is to be forced to surrender
the deposit also.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha*, (p. 84);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 208);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 89), which notes that in
the same text the Matsyapurāṇa reads ‘*dviguṇam damam*’; it says that
Manu’s rule is meant for cases where the persons concerned are poor and
well-behaved;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (83b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 113a), whieh explains ‘*śāsyau*’ as ‘should be punished and
fined.’
