<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

By the declaration that one does not deserve punishment by giving a girl
suffering from the defects of insanity and the rest, after having openly
declared them,—what is meant is that by giving her without declaring the
defects, one does become liable to punishment.

Not only in the case of the girl given for a price, but also in that of
others, who is going to be married by the ‘*Brāhma*’ and other
forms,—the betrothal becomes invalidated, and the penalty is that ‘the
man becomes guilty of theft’ (verse 198),—if he does it intentionally;
the case in which it is done unintentionally does not fall within the
scope of the present context (which deals with ‘*fraud*’).

The construction is as follows:—‘If the man openly declares, at the time
of betrothal, the defect of the ‘*insane*’ girl, *i.e*., insanity,—of
the ‘*leprous*’ girl—*i.e*., leprosy—of the girl who ‘*has suffered
copulation*’—*i.e*., loss of virginity,—by saying ‘this girl has such
and such a defect,’—then he is not liable to punishment.—(205)
