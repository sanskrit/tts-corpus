<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When, as a matter of fact, a man is really learned, one may say ‘this
has not been properly learnt by him’; or he may defame his learning by
declaring—‘what he has learnt is not right.’

With regard to one who regards himself as an inhabitant of Brahmāvarta,
he may say ‘he is a foreigner.’

With regard to a real Brāhmaṇa, he may say ‘he is a Kṣatriya’; or
through friendship he may call a *Kṣatriya*, ‘*Brāhmaṇa*.’

‘*Occupation*’;—the ‘student’ may be called ‘one who has finished his
studies.’

In regard to one’s ‘*bodily details*, ho may say ‘he is suffering from
skin diseases,’ when, in reality, the man has no defects at all.

‘*Falsely* ’;—‘*false*’ is what is a lie. The instrumental ending being
used in accordance with Pāṇini’s rule ‘*Prakṛtyādibhya upasaṅkhyānam*.’

Or ‘*falsity*’ may stand for *unrighteousness*; and it is only right
that *unrighteousness* should be regarded as instrumental in defaming
other persons.

‘*Through arrogance*’;—‘*arrogance*’ stands for *disregard for others*.
So that if the assertions in question are made through ignorance, or in
joke, there is no harm.

“For whom is this penalty laid down?”

We say—for all castes. Others however hold that, since the context
pertains to the *Śūdra*, it must be regarded as meant for the *Śūdra*
falsely defaming a twice-born person.—(273)

*Cf*. 2.19-11.

‘*Karma śārīram*’—‘With reference to occupation *and* to the body’
(Medhātithi);—‘bodily sacraments’ (Kullūka and others).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 254), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Karma*,’ austerities and the like;—‘*śārīram*,’ limbs
of the body,—‘*vitathena*,’ falsely,—the meaning being that if one,
through arrogance, spreads false reports regarding the learning,
country, caste, austerities, and limbs of another, he shall be fined
200. The Instrumental ending in ‘*Vitathena*’ is in accordance with
*Pāṇini’s Sūtra* ‘*Prakṛtyādibhya upasaṅkhyānam*’;—‘*Śruta*’, ‘learning’
and the rest are mentioned by way of illustration of the false reports;
*e*.*g*.—‘This man has not learnt the Veda,’ ‘he is not an inhabitant of
Āryāvarta,’ ‘he is not a Brāhmaṇa,’ ‘he has performed no austerity at
all,’ ‘his skin is not free from disease’ and so forth.—‘*Darpa*’ stands
for the high opinion that one has in regard to his own qualifications
and consequently the low opinion that he has with regard to other
persons.

first degree.’
