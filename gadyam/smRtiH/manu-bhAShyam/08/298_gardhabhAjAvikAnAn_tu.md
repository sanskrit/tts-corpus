पञ्च माषाः परिमाणम् अस्येति **पाञ्चमाषिकः** । माषस्य च द्रव्यजातेर् अनुपपादनान् मध्यमकल्पनायाश् च न्याय्यत्वाद् रौप्यस्य निर्देशो ऽयम् इत्य् आहुः । हिरण्यं तु युक्तम् । एवं तत्समम् इति न[^२८१] वाधिकं भवति । अनुबन्धाद्यपेक्षया तु द्रव्यजातिः कल्प्येति सिद्धान्तः ॥ ८.२९८ ॥

The term ‘*pāñcamāṣika*’ means ‘that of which *five māṣas* is the
measure’; since the substance is not mentioned of which there shall be
‘five māṣas,’ the most reasonable conclusion is to take the mean,
*i.e*., a substance of medium quality; hence it is ‘*five māṣas*’ of
*silver* that is meant; so say some people.

But the right view is to take it as referring to *gold*; and in this
sense the present assertion does not militate against anything that has
been said before with regard to its being ‘equal to it’ (?)

The final conclusion is that the exact substance is to be determined in
accordance with the circumstances of each individual case.—(298)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p; 283), which notes that the
‘*māṣaka*’ is equal to two *kṛṣṇalas*, as declared by *Pārijāta*;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 291);—and in *Mitākṣarā* (2.300), where
*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following notes:—For the killing of a donkey, or
goat, or sheep, the fine consists in *silver*, 5 *Māsas* in weight, and
not *gold*, and for the killing of a dog or a pig, one *Māṣa* of silver.
It notes both the readings, ‘*pāñcamāṣikaḥ*... *māṣikaḥ*’ and
‘*pañcamāṣakaḥ...... māṣakaḥ*’.
