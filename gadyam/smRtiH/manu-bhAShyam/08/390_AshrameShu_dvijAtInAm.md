<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In regard to the ‘duties’ of the various orders of the Hermit dwelling
in the forests, several disputes arise as to this and not that being the
sense of the scriptures.

When these men happen to dispute among themselves, the king shall not,
in a hurry, lay down the law; *i.e*., he should not, in the exercise of
his sovereign power, determine what the law on the point is. What he
should do and how is going to be explained later on.

By acting in this manner, the king accomplishes his own welfare; *i.e*.,
he does not relinquish the injunctions of the scriptures.

In the case of householders, even though they also belong to an
‘order,’—yet, the method of laying down the law should be the same as
laid down before (and not as declared in the present text, which
pertains to the Hermit and the Recluse only).

‘*Points*’—*i.e*., doubtful questions regarding the duties; that this
refers to this particular matter of *duties* is indicated by the mention
of the ‘orders.’—(390)

‘*Āśrameṣu*’—‘The hermitages of Vānaprasthas and other hermits living in
the forest’ (Medhātithi);—‘the Householder’s and other life-stages’
(Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 4);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 10a), which explains ‘*āśrameṣu kārye*’ as ‘business arising
out of the life-stages’;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (10a), which explains
‘*āśrameṣu*’ as ‘in the matter of the life-stages’,—and ‘*na vibrūyāt*,’
as ‘should not apportion victory and defeat.’
