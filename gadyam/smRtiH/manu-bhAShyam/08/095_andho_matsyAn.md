‘He who, having entered the court, bears testimony to what is contrary to facts and what he has not seen, swallows fish along with the bones,—just like a blind man.’—(95)

The pleasure produced by the eating of the fish is not equal to the pain
caused by the swallowing of the bones; similarly, there is a slight
pleasure produced by the little money that is received (as bribe), but
the subsequent suffering is very great; it is on this basis that the
analogy of fish-eating has been cited.—(95)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 205), whiqḥ says
that according to some

people, this and the preceding two verses are to be addressed to
witnesses of the lower order only; hence in ordinary cases, after
‘*kurūn gamaḥ*’, the exhortation should begin with ‘*yāvato bāndhavān*
&c.’ (verse 97);—these exhortations are to be addressed to Śūdras and to
poverty-stricken twice-born persons also;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (35b).

095	'That man who in a court (of justice) gives an untrue account of a transaction (or asserts a fact) of which he was not an eye-witness, resembles a blind man who swallows fish with the bones.
