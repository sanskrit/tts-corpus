The preceding verse encourages the witnesses by putting before them the
spiritual and temporal results following from the telling of truth; the
present verso describes how results accrue from saying what is contrary
to truth; and the purpose of this also is to induce the witness to tell
the truth.

‘*Sākṣya*,’ ‘*evidence*,’ is the work of the witness; in that work,
stating what is not true, the man becomes ‘*bound*’—tormented—‘*in
Varuṇa’s fetters*,’—‘*firmly*’—to a very great extent;—‘*helpless*’—
rendered totally dependent on others, even in regard to the operations
of speech and the eyes,—‘*during a hundred births*.’

‘*Varuṇa’s fetters*’ are in the shape of terrible snakes or in the form
of the disease of *dropsy*.

In order to guard against such calamities, the witness should state the
truth;—such is the sense of the injunction implied by the text.

In the term ‘*ājātīḥ*,’ the initial *ā* is not the indeclinable ‘*āṅ*’
which denotes *limit*; for, if it were that or we would have the
Ablative ending. Hence it is to be taken as a preposition meaning
nothing; just like the preposition ‘*pra*’ in such words as
‘*pralambate*’ and the like. The case-ending also is the Accusative.
What the term signifies is *repetition*; the meaning being that the man
sutlers from dropsy repeatedly during one hundred births.—(82)

“Dropsy is a disease specially attributed to Varuṇa (see Ṛgveda 7.89.1,
and the story of Śunaḥśepha, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7.15). The fetters of
Varuṇa are mentioned as the punishment of liars in the Atharva Veda,
4.16.6.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 199);—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (33b), which explains ‘*śatam-ājātīḥ*’ as ‘during a
hundred lives’;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 53b).
