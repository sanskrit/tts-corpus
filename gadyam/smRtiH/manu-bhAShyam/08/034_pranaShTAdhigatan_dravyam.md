‘*Shall take*’—sieze—either the sixth or the tenth or the twelfth
part—of the property lost and found, and make over the remainder to the
owner. During the first year, he shall take the twelfth part, during the
second year, the tenth part, and during the third year, the sixth part.
Or, the option regarding the share may be based upon the amount of
trouble entailed in taking care of the property.

‘*Remembering the duty of good men*,’—*i.e*., knowing that such is the
practice among cultured people.—(34)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 347), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Praṇaṣṭādhigatam*’, ‘was first lost and then
recovered’;—‘*yuktaiḥ*’, ‘carefully devoted to guarding the
property—‘*ibhena*’, ‘by means of an elephant’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(p. 149). which notes that the ‘guarding’ is to be done by the king’s
officers, and explains ‘*ibhena*’ as ‘by an elephant’.
