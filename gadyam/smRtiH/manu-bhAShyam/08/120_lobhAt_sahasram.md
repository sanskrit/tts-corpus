<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When the man deposes falsely after receiving a bribe from another
person, his motive is *greed*.

‘*Through embarrassment*.’—Though the man may be quite truthful,
habituated to speak in strict accordance with what he has actually seen,
yet on account of some distraction of the mind, at the time of his
examination, he may be so confused as to be unable either to comprehend
the question or to recall the exact facts of the case, and thereby he
may make statements that are not true; in this case the reason is
‘*embarrassment*.’

‘*Fright*’ is *fear*, in the form of the suspicion—‘if this man was to
lose the case through my telling the truth, he would ruin me by injuring
my relations, or by making me suffer financially.’

‘*One thousand*;’—what is that to which this number appertains is to be
learnt from other passages: they are ‘*paṇas*.’

‘*Lowest amercement’—i.e*. 250 *paṇas*, as described under 138 below.

‘*Two middling ones’—i.e*., amercements; the number being changed into
the dual.

‘*Four times the first,’—i.e*. 1,000 *paṇas*.

It is through metrical considerations that the same idea is expressed in
various ways.—(120)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 82);—and in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 2.811), which adds the following notes—‘*Lobha*’ is
greed for wealth,—‘*moha*’, wrong information,—‘*bhaya*’,
fear,—‘*maitrī*’, too much affection,—‘*kāma*’, longing for intercourse
with women,—‘*krodha*’, anger. It adds that the 1,000 and other numbers
refer to so many *copper paṇas*.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 680), which adds the following notes:—The
numbers here mentioned refer to *kārṣāpaṇas*. Some people might think
that there are two kinds of perjury—one through greed and the rest, for
which the penalty shall he as prescribed by *Manu*, and another due to
other causes, for which the penalty would be that prescribed by
*Yājñavalkya* (2.81). But this would not he the right view, because as
already shown by Manu (in 118), people commit perjury only through greed
and other causes enumerated therein.

It is quoted in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 191), which says:—If the witness
lie, through avarice, he should he fined 1,000 *paṇas*,—if through
delusion, 250 *paṇas*,—if through fear 1,000 *paṇas*,—if through
friendliness 1,000 *paṇas*;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (37a), which says
that ‘thousand’ *paṇas* are meant,—‘*mohāt*’ means ‘through
absent-mindedness’—that ‘*pūrva sāhasa*’ stands for 250 *paṇas*,—‘*dvau
madhyamau*’ means ‘*dvau madhyamau sāhasau*’, which means 1,000
*paṇas*,—‘*pūrvam*’ means ‘first amercement’, four times of which means
1,000 *paṇas*.

120	(He who commits perjury) through covetousness shall be fined one thousand (panas), (he who does it) through distraction, in the lowest amercement; (if a man does it) through fear, two middling amercements shall be paid as a fine, (if he does it) through friendship, four times the amount of the lowest (amercement).
