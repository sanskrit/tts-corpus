the ‘*cotton tree*’ is a kind of tree; the board should be made out of
this tree; because its wood is naturally soft and ‘*smooth*,’ so th.it
when the clothes are beaten upon it, their component parts do not become
torn.

‘*Gently*’—so that the clothes being beaten do not become torn.

The injunction regarding the particular wood is not with a view to any
transcendental result; hence there would be nothing wrong in using any
other wood, if it satisfied the said conditions.

‘*Smooth*’—not rough.

‘*Clothes*’—belonging to one man,—he shall not ‘*carry*’— tie up and
carry to the washing place—‘*in other clothes*’—belonging to another
person; so that the clothes may not be torn by the tying, in which they
undergo a great strain.

‘*Nor shall he allow them to be worn*’;—he shall not give over, for a
consideration, to one man the clothes belonging to another, for wearing.
This is what is meant by ‘allowing to wear’; the other man does the
*wearing*, and it is the washerman that *allows* him to do it.

Since no penalty has been laid down in this connoction, we have to take
it as consisting of the ‘*māṣa* of gold’ which has been laid down
before.—(396)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 823), which adds the following
notes:—The washerman shall not carry clothes tying them in
cloth;—‘*navāsayet*,’ nor should he keep them in his house, or he should
not allow them to be used by others on receiving cash-hire from them.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.238), which adds the following
explanation:—The washerman shall wash clothes by rinsing them on a plank
of cotton-wood, and not on stone; he shall not mix them up, *i.e*.,
shall not exchange them among the diverse owners, says
*Bālambhaṭṭī*,—nor shall he keep them in his house;—if he does any of
these things, he should be punished.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 313), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Śālmale*,’ made of cotton-wood,—‘*ślakṣṇe*,’
soft,—‘*nirṇijyāt*,’ should wash,—‘*nejakaḥ*,’ washerman,—‘*nacha
vāsāṃsi vāsobhirnirharet*,’ he should not carry clothes tied up in other
clothes, to the washing-place,—‘*na ca vāsayet*,’ he should not let the
clothes of one person be worn by another. The meaning is that if he does
not act up to these rules, he becomes liable to punishment.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 311), as laying down
rules for washermen.
