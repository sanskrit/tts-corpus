In as much as nothing is specified, the ‘*thief*’ here is to be
understood as one who has stolen *gold*; specially as it is only in the
case of such a thief that other Smṛti-texts have laid down the
‘approaching of the king.’ The present text itself cannot be taken as an
injunction laying down the act of ‘approaching’; because the
subject-matter of the present context consists of the injunction of
punishments for theft, as clearly declared above in Verse 301—‘I am now
going to expound the law relating to punishments for theft.’ Hence the
present can only be taken as a *re-iteration* of the act of
‘approaching’ (enjoined elsewhere); hence it must mean that ‘one who has
stolen gold should approach the king’—‘*with flying hair*.’

‘*Wise*’—courageous.

Another reading for ‘*dhīmatā*,’ ‘*wise*,’ is ‘*dhāvatā*,’ ‘*running*.’
‘*confessing*’—proclaiming his crime on the road—‘*i have done
this*’—act of stealing brāhmaṇa’s gold—inflict upon me the proper
punishment.’—(314)

**(verses 8.314-315)**

[\[ *See* Manu
11.100-101.\]]

*Gautama* (12.48).—‘A man who has stolen gold shall approach the King,
with flying hair, holding a club in his hand, and proclaim his deed.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.16-17).—‘A thief shall go to the King with flying
hair, carrying on his shoulder a club of *sindhuka* wood, and say
‘strike me with this.’ Then the King shall strike him. They quote the
following verse:—“A thief shall go to the King carrying a club on his
shoulder and say to him, *Punish me with this, O King*.”’

*Āpastamba* (1.25.4).—‘A thief shall go to the King with flying hair,
carrying a club on his shoulder and tell him what he has done. The King
shall give him a blow with that club. If the thief dies, his sin is
expiated.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.41).—‘If a man has stolon gold belonging to a Brāhmaṇa he
shall run with flying hair to the King, exclaiming “Ho! I am a thief,
Sir, punish me.” The King shall give him a weapon made of *udumbara*
wood, with that he shall kill himself. It is declared in the Veda that
he becomes purified by this death.’

*Viṣṇu* (52.1).—‘He who has stolen gold must bring a club to the King,
proclaiming his deed.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.257).—‘The man who has stolen gold belonging to a
Brāhmaṇa shall present to the King a club, proclaiming his deed; he
becomes purified if the King kills him with it, or pardons him.’

*Nārada* (Theft, 27).—‘For stealing more than a hundred *palas* of gold,
silver, or other precious metals, or line clothes, or very precious
gems, corporal punishment or death shall be inflicted.’

*Nārada* (Theft, 46).—‘The thief must approach the King with flying hair
running and proclaiming his deed, saying “thus have I acted, chastise
me.” By so doing, he is cleared from guilt, because he has confessed his
deed. The King therefore shall touch him with the club or dismiss him.’

*Bṛhaspati* (22.27-28).—‘For the stealing of women, men, gold, gems, the
property of a deity or Brāhmaṇa, silk and other valuable things, the
fine shall he equal to the value of the article stolen; or double the
amount shall be inflicted by the King as fine; or the thief shall be
executed, to prevent a repetition of the offence.’

*Saṃvarta* (Aparārka, p. 1079).—‘Then the King himself shall strike the
thief with a club; if the thief is alive after this, he becomes freed
from the sin of stealing.’
