**चर्मचार्मिकयोर्** द्वन्द्वं कृत्वा **भाण्ड**पदेन विशेष्येण समासः । अथ वा धार्मिकभाण्डयोर् विशेषणसमासं कृत्वा **चर्म**शब्देन द्वन्द्वः । चर्मविकाराच् **चार्मिकाणि** **भाण्डानि** कटिसूत्रवरत्रादीनि । **चर्माण्य्** अविकृतानि गवादीनां । अथ वा **चर्मभाण्डानि** केवचर्ममयानि, चर्मावनद्धानि **चार्मिकाणि** । **काष्ठमयभाण्डान्य्** उलूखलमुसलफलकादीनि । **लोष्ठो** मृद्विकारः पाषाणाकृतिः पिण्डीभूता मृत् । तन्मयानि स्वल्पपाकाधानादीनि । तन्नाशने **मूल्यात् पञ्चगुणो दण्डः** । तुष्ट्युत्पत्तिश् च स्वामिनः स्थितैव ॥ ८.२८९ ॥

Between ‘*carma*’ and ‘*cārmika*’ we have the copulative compound, and
between the compound thus formed and the term ‘*bhāṇḍa*’ we have the
Determinate Compound. Or, there is Determinate Compound between
‘*carma*’ and ‘*cārmika*,’ and Copulative Compound between the compound
thus formed and the term ‘*bhāṇḍa*.’

‘*Leathern*’ means *made of leather*; and ‘leathern vessels’ meant are
the leather-bottle and such other articles.

‘*Leather*’—stands for the mere *skin* of the cow and other animals, not
made into anything.

Or, the term ‘*leathern vessel*’ may stand for such vessels as are made
of leather only, while ‘*leathern vessel*’ for those that are only bound
up with leather.

Vessels ‘*made of wood*’—the mortar, the pestle, the board and so forth.

‘*Clay*’ is a form of earth, *i.e*., earth hardened into the form of
stone; and vessels made of these are the cooking utensils, etc.

In the case of damage done to these ‘*the fine shall be five times their
price*’; and the satisfaction of the owner has of course got to be
brought about.—(289)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 352), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Cārmikam*’, ‘shoes and other leather goods,’—some
people explain that in the expressions ‘*carmacārmikam*’, the first
‘*carma*’ serves the purpose of making the meaning
clearer,—‘*kāṣṭhamayam*’, the *Prostha* and such
things,—‘*loṣṭṛamayam*’, the jar and such things,—the fine equal to five
times the value of the flowers eta is one that has been laid down by
Bṛhaspati also, but elsewhere Manu has laid down the fine to be hundred
and more times the value of the flower etc.,—and these are to be
reconciled by the view that the exact fine in each case is to be
determined by the quality of the flower etc., damaged;—it has to be
noted that the satisfaction of the injured party has to be seemed in
these cases also.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 820).
