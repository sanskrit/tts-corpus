**तत्र** परीहारस्थाने क्षेत्रं न कर्तव्यम् । अथ कृतं तस्माद् वृत्तिर् न कृता । अतः क्षेत्रिण एवापराध्यन्ति, न पशुपालाः । न हि पाल एकैकं पशुं हस्तबन्धेन नेतुं शक्नोति । न च पशूनाम् अन्यो निर्गमो ऽस्ति ॥ ८.२३८ ॥

As a rule, no crops should be grown on the pasture-lands; since if they
have been grown,—why should fences have not been put up? The fault thus
lies with the cultivator, and not with the cattle-keepers. The
cattle-keeper cannot always be leading each individual animal by the
rope; and there is no other grazing ground for the cattle.—(238)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.162), to the effect that this
impurity pertains only to cases where the crops are not fenced.

*Yājñavalkya* (2.162).—‘If cattle graze in a field on the road-side, or
near the village pasture-land, there is no offence, if it goes there by
chance, and not intentionally on the part of the cowherd.’

*Nārada* (11.40).—‘When a field is situated on the borders of a village,
or contiguous to the pasture-land, or adjacent to a high road, the
herdsman is not reprehensible for any damage to the crops, if the field
is not protected by a fence.’

*Gautama* (12.21).—‘If damage is done in an unenclosed field near the
road, the responsibility falls on the herdsman and on the owner of the
field.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.147-148).—‘There is no offence if the damage has been done
near a highway, or near a village, or in a field adjacent to the
pasture-ground; or if it has been done in an unenclosed field.’
