The paramour of the woman spoken of in the preceding verse shall be

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 857), which adds that this
applies to men other than Brāhmaṇas;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 39), which
explains ‘*abhyādadhyuḥ*’ as ‘should scatter round him’—and adds that
this is to be done by the executioners.

*Mahābhārata* (12.165.65).—(Same as Manu, but reading ‘*unnayet*’ for
‘*dāhayet*’)

*Gautama* (23.15).—‘If a man of inferior caste commits adultery with a
woman of a superior caste, the King shall put him to death.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (21.1-5).—‘If a Śūdra approaches a female of the Brāhmaṇa
caste, the King shall cause him to be tied up in *Vīraṇa* grass and
thrown into fire. Of the woman, he shall have the hair shaved and the
body anointed with butter; then placing her naked on a donkey, he shall
cause her to be conducted along the public road; it is declared that by
this she becomes purified. If a Vaiśya approaches a female of the
Brāhmaṇa caste, the King shall have him tied up in *Lohita* grass and
thrown into fire;—\[the woman is to be dealt with as above\]. If a
Kṣatriya approaches a female of the Brāhmaṇa caste, the King shall have
him tied up in the leaves of *Śara* grass and thrown into fire; \[the
woman is to be dealt with as above\], A Vaiśya offending with a Kṣatriya
woman shall be dealt with in the same manner; so also a Śūdra offending
with a Vaiśva or Ksatriya woman.’
