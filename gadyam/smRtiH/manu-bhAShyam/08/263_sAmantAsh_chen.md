The punishment of the neighbours is to be severer than that laid down
above (in 257).

‘*Severally*.’—This is a mere reiteration, the law on this point having
been already declared before.

The holders of neighbouring fields are sure to know the right boundary;
hence if they happen to give false evidence, their punishment should be
heavy. As for ordinary neighbours (living in the neighbourhood), it is
not necessary that they should be cognisant of the exact boundaries of
fields, etc.; hence in their case the fine is to be ‘two hundred,’ as
laid down before (257). Hence in the case of the boundaries between two
villages, such persons as may have been seeing it, as also the
neighbours, are to be fined ‘two hundred’ (if they give false evidence).

On the strength of the use of the term ‘neighbours’ in the present
context, some people have held that the penalty should be the same, both
in the case of boundaries between villages and that of boundaries
between fields. But this view is contrary to all reason, and hence
should he ignored.—(263)
