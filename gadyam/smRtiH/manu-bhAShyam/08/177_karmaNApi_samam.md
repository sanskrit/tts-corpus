For verse 177, G gives the following which is NSm 1.112: अथ शक्तिविहीहः स्यात् ऋणी कालविपर्ययात् । प्रेक्ष्यश् च तम् ऋणं दाप्यः काले देशे यथोदयम् ॥ ८।१७७ ॥ And then gives the following commentary: यद्य् अधमर्णो दैवदोषान् निर्धनीभूतस् तदा न दुर्गादानादिना राज्ञोपपीडयितव्यः । किं तर्हि कर्तव्यं यदास्य कथंचिद् धनं भवेत् तदा यथासंभवं शनैर् दापयितव्यः । प्रेक्ष्य शक्तिं धनवृत्तां युज्यत इत्य् अर्थः । दाप्यः उचितस्य वक्ष्यति "कर्मणापि समः कुर्यात्" इति । तस्मात् कारणपरिवृत्तौ यद् एवोक्तम् अस्माभिस् तदैव प्रयोजनम् ॥ ८।१७७ ॥

निर्धनो ऽधमर्णो निर्धनत्वान् न मुच्यते । किं तर्हि, कर्म कारयितव्यः । प्रेष्यत्वं व्रजेत् । यावता धनेन तत् कर्म कर्मकरः करोति, तत् तस्य प्रविष्टं संपद्य्[^५४८] अपि कर्तव्यम् ।

If the debtor has no property, he is not let off simply because he has
no property; he should he made to do ‘*labour*’; *i.e*., he should
become a servant, and the amount of wages that would, be payable to the
servant for doing the work that he does shall be credited to his
account; and when the total amount thus credited equals the sum of his
debt along with the interest, then he should be freed from service.

‘*Make good to the creditor*’; ‘*uttamarṇa*’ and ‘*udhamarṇa*’ are
relative terms applied to one or the other party on the basis of their
possessions.

The manual labour is made to be done by all who are of the same caste
as, or of the lower caste than, the creditor.

‘*The superior person*’—*i.e*., one belonging to a higher caste, or
possessed of higher qualifications—‘*shall pay it up gradually*’—*i.e*.,
according as he goes on earning. We read in Nārada—‘If the Brāhmaṇa is
poor, he shall pay up gradually according to his circumstances.’ Hence
for the liquidation of the creditor’s debts, the Brāhmaṇa shall not he
made by the king to suffer any pains; and the interests of the creditor
too have to be protected.—(177)

*Cf*. 8.49, and 9.229; also 8.415.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.43), which explains the meaning
to be that “the debtor should make himself ‘*samam*’, equal, to the
creditor by putting an end ṭo the relation of creditor and debtor”;—in
*Aparārka* (p. 146), which explains the meaning to be that “even by
doing some work for the creditor, the debtor should make himself equal,
similar, to the creditor, by becoming free from debt”;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 70), which adds the following explanation:—The
debtor, who is either of the same caste with, or of a lower caste than,
the creditor, should, even by means of working, clear off his debt, and
thereby render himself *equal* to the creditor. So long as the debt is
not paid off, there is an *inequality* between them—one being the
*creditor* and the other the *debtor*; but when by means of work, the
debt has been paid off, both of them become ‘equal’.—But if the debtor
belongs to a *higher* caste, he should not be made by the creditor to
work for him.

It is quoted also in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 89);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(79b), which explains ‘*samam kuryāt*’ as ‘remove his *indebtedness*,
which puts him in a position lower than that of his creditor, by doing
such work for the latter as would suffice to liquify the amount of
debt’—‘*śreyān*’ is ‘one belonging to a higher caste’ and also ‘one
possessed of higher qualifications’;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
104b), which also has the same explanation.

*Bṛhaspati* (11.59).—‘An indigent debtor may be taken by the creditor to
his own house and compelled to work there, such as distilling spirits
and the like; but a Brāhmaṇa should be made to pay gradually.’

*Nārada* (1.132).—“If a wealthy debtor, from malice, refuses to pay his
debt, the King shall compel him to pay it by forcible means, and shall
take five in the hundred for himself.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.43)—‘If the debtor of a lower caste is too indigent to
pay, the creditor shall make him do work; but an indigent Brāhmaṇa
should he made to pay gradually, as he obtains the means to pay.’
