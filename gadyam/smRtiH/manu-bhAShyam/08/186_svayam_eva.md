<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It has been just declared that while the depositor is still alive, the
deposit shall not be handed over to his ‘next-of-kin.’ But when he is
dead, if the depositary should himself restore the property to his heir,
who does not know that it belongs to him, then he shall not be made to
undergo the trouble of a law-suit and all that follows in its wake.

If there be a suspicion that there may he something more with the
man,—on the ground that the deceased was a wealthy man and he did not
keep his property with any other person,—then other kinds of evidence
shall be considered, but the man shall not be harassed with oaths or
ordeals with poison, etc.; though there would he nothing wrong in the
employment of such test as the ‘*ghaṭakośa*,’ the ‘*satyataṇḍula*’ and
so forth (which are not so humiliating).

The condition of ‘*the absence of witnesses*’ (mentioned in 182-183)
should be taken as applicable here also.—(186)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 87), whieh adds the
following explanation:—On the death of the depositor, if the depository
deliver the deposit to the depositor’s heir, he should not be blamed
either by the king or by the dead man’s relatives. The term
‘*svayameva*’ implies that during the depositor’s life-time, he should
not deliver it to the heir, even though asked to do so by the
latter;—and that on his death he should give it to the heir even without
being asked to do so;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 37).

*Nārada* (11.10).—‘The depositor being dead, if the depositary restores
the deposit to his next of kin of his own accord, he must not be
harassed, either by the King or by the relations of the depositor.’

186	But (a depositary) who of his own accord returns them to a near relative of a deceased (depositor), must not be harassed (about them) by the king or by the depositor's relatives.
