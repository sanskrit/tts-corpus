The Brāhmaṇa should be made to swear by truth, the Kṣatriya by conveyances and weapons, the Vaiśya by cattle, grains and gold, and the Śūdra by all sins.—(113)

[^१०६]:
     The reading should probably be "ebhis", glossed as "vakṣyamāṇāni" and "vakṣyamāṇaiḥ" at 8.88; see also the citation of this phrase at 8.99, where "ebhis" is used.

ननु च यद्य् अहम् एवंकुर्यां तद् इदम् अनिष्टम् आप्नुयाम् इति संकीर्तनक्रियाशपथं तं यः कारयेत् स **शापयेद्** इत्य् उच्यते । **सत्येन** शपे सत्यादिनिबन्धनो ऽयं धर्मो वा मे निष्फलः स्याद् इति । एवं चायुधानाम् अपि करणत्वं वाहनानां च । एतैर् आत्मानं शपतो न वा निष्फलानि स्युर् इति । **गोबीजकाञ्चनानि** वैश्यो हस्तेन स्पर्शयित्वाभिशपेद् एतानि वा मे निष्फलानित् पूर्ववत् । **शूद्रं सर्वैस् तु पातकैः** "वक्ष्यमाणानि पातकानि मे स्युः" इति शूद्रो वाच्यते ॥ ८.११३ ॥

In as much as the act of ‘swearing’ consists in invoking upon oneself
evil consequences,—such as ‘If I do this may such and such an evil
befall me,’—when a man is made to say ‘I swear by truth,’ what is meant
is—‘may all my merit due to truthfulness become futile.’

‘*Conveyances*’ and ‘*weapons*’ also are the means of swearing in this
same sense; when one swears by these it means—‘may these be useless for
me.’

‘*Cattle, grains and gold*,’—the Vaiśya should be made to swear by
touching these; which would mean ‘may these be useless for me.’

‘*The Śūdra by all sins*’;—the *Śūdra* should be made to say—‘may the
following sins befall me.’—(113)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.73), which adds the following
notes:—To the Brāhmaṇa he should administer the oath—‘If you tell a lie
your truthfulness shall perish’; to the Kṣatriya, ‘your conveyances and
weapons shall be futile’; to the Vaiśya, ‘your cattle, seeds and gold
shall be useless;’ to the Śūdra, ‘if you tell a lie all the sins shall
accrue to thee.’ It adds that verse 102 provides an exception to the
rule here laid down.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 19), and again on p. 38;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 78);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 611),
which adds the following notes:—The Brāhmaṇa he shall cause to take the
oath in the form ‘what I say is quite *true*,’ and what he says after
this should be accepted as true;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 336);—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (62a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 88b).

*Viṣṇu* (8.20-23).—‘The Brāhmaṇa witness should be asked to *declare*:
the Kṣatriya to *declare the truth*; the Vaiśya should be addressed
thus—“*Thy kine*, *grain and gold shall yield thee no fruit if thou wert
to lie*”: the Śūdra should be addressed thus—“*Thou shall have to atone
for all heavy crimes if thou wert to lie*.”’

*Nārada* (1.248).—‘Let him cause the Brāhmaṇa to swear by truth, the
Kṣatriya by his conveyance and by his weapons, the Vaiśya by his gold,
grains, cows and so forth; or all by venerable deities or deified
ancestors, or by their own pious gifts or meritorious deeds.’

113	Let the (judge) cause a Brahmana to swear by his veracity, a Kshatriya by his chariot or the animal he rides on and by his weapons, a Vaisya by his kine, grain, and gold, and a Sudra by (imprecating on his own head the guilt) of all grievous offences (pataka).
