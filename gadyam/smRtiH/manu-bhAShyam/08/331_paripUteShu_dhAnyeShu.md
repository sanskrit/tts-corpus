‘*Roots, etc*.,’—*e.g*., sugar-cane, grapes and so forth.

In a case of theft which is ‘*niranvaya*’;—‘*anvaya*’ stands for
‘*propitiation*,’ the adopting of a conciliatory attitude towards the
owner, such as—‘I took this thing under the impression that what is
yours is mine also; if this be not so, then take it,’—or some such
words;—where this is not done, it is a ‘*case where there has been no
propitiation*’; and this being a form of ‘robbery,’ the punishment is
severe.

A case where there has been such ‘propitiation’ is called ‘*sānvaya*.’

Or, the meaning may be that there shall be a fine of ‘hundred’ in a case
where there is no ‘*relationship*’ between the parties,—such as living
in the same village and so forth.

Or, ‘*niranvaya*’ may mean ‘*unguarded*.’ Where the watchman is present,
since the fault lies with both (thief as well as the watchman), the
punishment of the thief shall be slight.

The punishment here laid down refers to the case of stealing corns lying
in the threshing yard, where they are husked. In the case of corns
stored in the house, the fine shall be ‘eleven times their value,’ as
declared above (330).—(331)

‘*Niranvaye*’—‘(*a*) Friendly leading, or, (*b*) neighbourliness, or
(*c*) absence of watchman’ (Medhātithi);—Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa have
(*a*);—and Kullūka and Rāghavānanda have (*b*).—See 198 above.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 324), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Paripūteṣu*,’ husked,—‘*niranvaye*,’ (the
appropriating being done) without any such justification as friendship
and the like; in view of the present rule being inconsistent with what
Manu has himself said in regard to ‘*vadha*’ being the penalty for
stealing more than 10 *kumbhas* of grains, and ‘eleven times’ the fine
for stealing lesser quantities,—people have held that the present rule
is meant for thefts from the harvesting yard, the heavier penalties
being for thefts from the houses.
