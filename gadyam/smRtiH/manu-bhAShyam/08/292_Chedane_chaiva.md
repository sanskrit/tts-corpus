When there is snapping of the nose-string, when the yoke is broken, when it turns sideways or backwards, when the axle breaks, and when the wheel is broken; (291) when the fittings or the yoking strap or the bridle are torn, and when there has been the loud cry ‘get out of the way,’—there is no punishment; so has Manu declared—(292)

**(verses 8.291-292)  
**

The text proceeds to show the cases where there is no offence.

‘*Nāsya*’ is that which pertains to the nose; the term ending in the
affix ‘*yat*,’ which is added because the basic noun ‘*nāsā*’ is the
name of a limb of the body. It stands for the string that passes through
the nostrils of the bullocks, as also for the *bridle* of the horse, or
the *goad* of the elephant—When this has ‘*snapped*.’

‘*When the yoke is broken*’;—‘yoke’ is the name of a piece of wood
forming part of the cart. The compound ‘*chinnanāsyā*,’ taken as
*Bahuvrīhi*, refers to the cart or to the animal, both of these being
connected with it, either directly or indirectly.

‘*When it turns sideways or backwards*,’—*i.e*., when the cart so turns.
When, either on account of the uneven ground, or by reason of the animal
having taken fright, the cart turns either sideways or backwards, and
some one happens to be hurt,—there lies no offence. The driver can sec
and guard against things only in front of him; so that when the cart
turns sideways, how can ho sec and avoid striking against anything that
may be there?

‘*Turning backwards*’ means *turning round*.

Others explain this phrase to mean that no offence lies in a case where
the injured party has turned sideways, while the cart is going on its
straight course; and ‘*pratimukha*’ they explain as ‘in front.’ The
reason for there being no offence in this case is that it is the fault
of the injured person himself why he did not make way for the cart
coining in front of himself.

‘*Axle*’ and ‘*wheel*’ are well known parts of the cart.

‘*Fittings*’— the leather thongs with which the wooden parts of the
chariot are tied up.

‘*Yoking strap*’— the piece of wood on the neck of the animal.

‘*Bridle*’—the string with which the movements of the yoked animals are
controlled.

‘*Loud cry*’—‘*get out of the way*’—*i.e*., move off. When the animals
have gone out of hand, if the driver keeps on crying ‘get out of the
way,’ if some one coming by that way happens to be hurt, the fault does
not lie with the driver.—(291-292)

**(verses 8.291-292)  
**

These verses are quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 863);—in *Mitākṣarā* (p. 299),
to the effect that the man is not liable to punishment as the damage is
not due to any act of his. *Bālambhaṭṭī* notes that under the ten
circumstances here enunciated, neither the owner nor the driver of the
chariot deserves any punishment;—the adjectives ‘*chinnanāsye*’ etc.,
refer to the bullocks or other animals yoked to the chariot,—the
‘*yuga*’ is a piece of wooden pole,—if the piece of wood inside the
wheel should happen to be broken on account of the unevenness of the
road,—if the ropes with which the several parts of the chariot are bound
should be snapped,—similarly on the snapping of the yoking-strap or the
reins,—the ‘*yoktra*’ being the yoking-strap with which the shaft is
tied to the back of the bullock,—the tenth circumstance is that when the
driver or some one in the chariot has been crying aloud ‘turn aside’;—if
under any of these ten circumstances, the chariot should happen to do
damage to any living being or to any property, the driver and the rest
are not liable to any punishment.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 281), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Chinnānasye*,’ the string connected with the nostrils
snapping,—‘*bhinnayuge*’, the wooden yoking-shaft breaking,—movement
caused by something coming up either sideways on in front, *i.e*., if by
reason of something else coming up sideways, or in front, the chariot
should be turned aside and thereby do damage, there is to be no
punishment,—‘*akṣa*’ is the piece of wood in the wheel (the
axle),—‘*yantrāṇām*’, the thongs with which the yoking shaft is tied
up,—‘*raśmi*’, the reins,—if the driver or some one else calls out
loudly ‘move off’, and yet disregarding the warning, some one comes too
near the chariot and becomes hurt, then the driver and others are not to
be punished.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 290), to the effect
that in a case where the hurt is caused by some one who is helpless in
the matter, he is not to be punished.
