When any property is stolen by thieves, the king should recover it; but
he should not use it himself; he should restore it to the persons that
may have been robbed.

The use of the term ‘*all*’ implies that stolen property shall be
restored to Caṇḍālas also.

If we read ‘*caurāhṛtam*’ (in place of ‘*chaurairhṛtam*’), the compound
should be expounded as ‘*chaurebhyaḥ āhṛtam*’—*i.e*., *recovered from
thieves*—in accordance with Pāṇini 2.1.32. If we adopt the (third)
reading ‘*chaurahṛtam*,’ the compounding would be in accordance with
Pāṇini 2.1.30.

What is meant is that if the property stolen by thieves is incapable of
being recovered, it should be made good by the king out of his own
treasury.

The second half of the verse—‘*By making use*, etc.’—should be construed
as follows:—The participle ‘*upayuñjānaḥ*’—derived from the root
‘*yuja*’ with the preposition ‘*upa*’—should be taken to indicate
figuratively *non-restoration*; the sense being that ‘if the king does
not restore to the person concerned the property that is his due, and if
he uses that property for his own purposes’, then it is said to be
‘retained’ by him; and ‘*by retaining such property the king imbibes the
sin of the thief*,’—‘*kilviṣa*’ meaning *sin*.—(40)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.36), which adds:—(a) If the
king recovers the stolen property from the thieves and keeps it for
himself, he takes the sin of the thief, (b) if he ignores the theft,
then the sins of the people fall upon him; (c) if, having tried his best
to recover the stolen property, he fails to do so, he should make good
the loss out of his own treasury.

*Gautuma* (10.46-47).—‘Having recovered property stolen by thieves, he
shall return it to the owner;—or he shall pay its value out of his own
treasury.’

*Āpastamba* (2.26.8) (2.268?).—‘The King’s officers should ho made to
repay what is stolen within the boundaries of their charge.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.66-67).—‘Having recovered the goods stolen by thieves, let
him restore them entire to their owners, to whatever caste they may
belong. If he is unable to recover them, he must pay their value out of
his own treasury.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.36).—‘The King should give to the people, what has been
stolen by thieves; if he does not give it, he incurs the sin of
stealing.’

*Vyāsa* (Aparārka, p. 641).—‘If the King is unable to recover what has
been stolen by thieves, he shall make it good out of his own treasury.’

*Nārada* (6.16 *et seq*.).—‘He on whose land robbery has been committed
must trace the thieves to the best of his power; or else, he must make
good what has been stolen, unless the footmarks can be traced from that
ground into another man’s ground. When the footmarks, after leaving that
ground, are lost and cannot be traced any further, the neighbours,
inspectors of the road and governors of that region shall be made
responsible for the loss. When a house has been plundered, the King
shall cause the thief-catchers, the guards and the inhabitants of that
region to make good the loss, if the thief is not caught.’
