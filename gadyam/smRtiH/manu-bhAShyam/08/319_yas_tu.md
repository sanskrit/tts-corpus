<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

A place where people drink water is called ‘*prapā*,’ ‘*water-drinking
establishment*,’ the place where water is stored after having been drawn
from a reservoir.

The exact nature of the substance is not stated—of what substance the
fine of a ‘*māṣa*’ shall consist. It should he regarded as being copper
or silver.

The article—rope and the rest—ho shall restore ‘*to the place*’ and not
to the king.—(319)

‘*Māṣam*’—‘Of gold’ (Kullūka);—‘the exact metal has not been mentioned;
it has to be determined on the merits of each case, according as the
institution damaged happens to he in a desert or in a country with
plentiful water-supply and so forth’ (Medhātithi, whom Buhler has
misrepresented).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 328), which adds the
following notes:—The meaning is that—‘that’, the damaged article,—in the
shape of the rope or the jar—he shall restore to the well. The
*Pārijata*, in view of the later pronoun ‘*tat*’ has read
‘*rājjughaṭam*’ and has explained it as a ‘collective copulative
compound’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 141), which reads
‘*rajjughaṭam*’ and explains it as ‘the rope or the jar’, and explains
the rule as that ‘one who steals the rope or the jar should replace it,
and he who damages the drinking-booth should be fined a *Māṣa*.’
