**मधयम उत्तम** इत्य् अत्र साहसपदानुषङ्गः कर्तव्यः । मधमोत्तमशब्दाव् अत्र केवलाव् अपि शास्त्रान्तरदृष्टौ- "आभ्यां दण्ड उत्तमः" इति । तत्र शास्त्रसिद्ध्या साहचर्यात् साहसं प्रतीयते । अवयवाः स्पष्टाः ॥ ८.१३८ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The term ‘*amercement*’ is to be construed also with the terms
‘*middling*’ and ‘*highest*’; though in other treatises these two terms
are found to be used by themselves also:—*e.g*., the punishment with
these is the ‘*Highest*.’ From the point of view of the scriptures, and
also from the juxtaposition of the words, they are to be regarded as
qualifying ‘*amercement*.’

The words of the text are quite clear.—(138)

‘*Sahasram*’—“Copper *paṇas* are meant”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (1.366), which remarks that the
fines here prescribed pertain to offences committed unintentionally;—in
*Aparārka*, (p. 592), which adds that these pertain to slight
offences;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 665);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti,
p. 295), which reproduces the words of *Aparārka*;—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 938);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 192),
which says that the numbers refer to *copper kārṣāpaṇas*.
