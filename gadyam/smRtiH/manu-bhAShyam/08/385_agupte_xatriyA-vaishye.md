This is the punishment for the Brāhmaṇa having intercourse with a
*Vaiśya* or a *Kṣatriya* woman.

‘*Of the lowest order*’—*i.e*., the *Caṇḍāla*, the *Śvapaca* and so
forth. In their case the fine shall be one thousand.

The law relating to the fine of thousand ‘*paṇas*’ is briefly as
follows:—For the Brāhmaṇa approaching a protected woman of any of the
four castes, the fine shall be one thousand; and in addition to this for
having intercourse with the wife of a Vedic scholar there shall be both
banishment and branding, while in other oases there shall be banishment
only. We presume this to be the case with the wife of a Vedio Scholar on
the ground that the expiatory rite prescribed in connection with such
intercourse is of a serious character.

For intercourse with an unprotected woman, there shall be a fine of five
hundred in addition to banishment and branding.

Though the unprotected woman may he spoken of as ‘another man’s wife,’
on account of her having undergone the marriage-rites, yet, in reality,
when she becomes loose in her character, she practically ceases to
belong to her husband.

For the non-Brāhmaṇa, there is death-penalty if he approaches by force a
protected woman: for approaching a willing woman, he shall be fined one
thousand, and also banishment and branding;—as laid down under 376
above.—(385)

‘*Antyajastriyam*’—‘Chāṇḍāla woman’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka
and Rāghavānanda);—‘woman belonging to such castes as washermen,
cobblers, actors, basket-makers, fishermen, *Mādas* and *Bhillas*’
(Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 394), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kṣatriyavaiśye*’ is the dual form in the
Accusative;—‘*antyajastrī*’, washerwoman and the like;—in view of what
is said here the death-penalty laid down elsewhere for having recourse
to the ‘*antyaja*’ woman should be understood as meant for men other
than Brāhmaṇas;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1008);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 108), which explains ‘*antyaja*’ as ‘the
washerwoman, the cobbler, and so forth.’
