If the guilty person is a good man and has committed a slight offence,
and for the first time, then he is only reprimanded: ‘you have not acted
well, do not do it again.’

If, on being thus reprimanded, the man does not desist, or goes on to
say ‘what is there wrong in this?’—then he is rebuked with such harsh
reproachful words as ‘fie,’ ‘shame’ and so forth.

If he does not desist even when thus rebuked, he should be punished with
fine, in accordance with the Law.

If he does not mind the fine either through folly or pride of
wealth,—then he should be killed. This ‘*death-penalty*’ consists in the
cutting off of certain limbs, etc., and not necessarily in actually
killing the man; as is clear from what follows in the next verse.—(129)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (1.366), which, in quoting it,
transposes, ‘*vāgdaṇḍam*’ and ‘*dhigdaṇḍam*,’—such reading is more in
keeping with Yājñvalkya’s text (1.356),—and it explains ‘*dhigdaṇḍa*’ as
addressing such terms as ‘fie upon thee,’—and ‘*vāgdaṇḍa*’ as
‘pronouncing a terrible curse

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 156); as laying down
the order of sequence among the various forms of punishment; it explains
*vāgdaṇḍa* as pronouncing a terrible curse (reproducing the exact words
of Mitākṣarā) and ‘*dhigdaṇḍa*’ as ‘chiding with such words as *fie* and
the like.’

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 630), which adds the following
notes:—‘*vāgdaṇḍa*’, ‘thou hast not done right,’—‘*dhigdaṇḍa*’, ‘fie
upon thee, damned sinner.’

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 273), which adds the
following notes:—The first two forms of punishment are meant for light
offences; ‘*vadhadaṇḍa*’ means *corporal punishment*, which has to be
inflicted upon all except the Brāhmaṇas.
