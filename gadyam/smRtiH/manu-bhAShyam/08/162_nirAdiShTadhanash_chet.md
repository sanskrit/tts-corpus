If the surety is one who is ‘*Nirādiṣṭadhanaḥ*,’ a person to whom money
has been handed over by the debtor, with the instruction—‘In the event
of my being unable to pay, you will please clear oil the debt with
this,’—and hence ‘*alandhanaḥ*,’ having ‘*enough money*’;—*i.e*., who
had made over to him money sufficient to pay off the whole amount due to
the creditor-then he should be made to pay. But if the amount made ever
to him was small, while the amount of the debt is large, then he should
not be made to pay.

This verse supplies the answer to the question in the preceding verse.

Though the money had been made over to the surety, yet it is the son who
is to be made to pay out as of his own property (the surety having
died). Hence the words should be construed to mean ‘the son of the
surety to whom money had been made over’; as it is the *son* that forms
the subject-matter of the context; as for the surety himself, his
liability would follow from the mere fact of his being a ‘surety.’

‘*Such is the settled rule*,’—ordinance deduced from the scriptures.

What is intended having been already expressed by the term
‘*alandhanaḥ*,’ ‘who had *enough money*,’— the addition of the term
‘*nirādiṣṭadhanaḥ*,’ ‘*to whom money had been made over*,’ is due to the
fact of the treatise being a metrical one (which admits of superfluous
words and expressions).—(162)

‘*Alandhanaḥ*’—Qualifies the surety (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and
Nārāyaṇa);—it qualifies the surety’s heir (Rāghavānanda);—Nandana reads
‘*alakṣitaḥ*’ and explains it as ‘if the surety who received the money
is not found.’

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 48), as providing the
answer to the question put in the preceding verse. It adds the following
explanation:—If the surety, to whom money had been handed over
(*nirādiṣṭa*) by the debtor, is ‘*alandhanaḥ*’,—*i.e*., he has really
got the money,—then, on his death, the ‘*nirādiṣṭaḥ*’—*i.e*., the *son*
of the surety to whom money had been handed over—should pay the debt out
of his own property. The term ‘*nirādiṣṭaḥ*’ is applied figuratively to
the *son*.

It is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (74a), which has the following
notes:—‘*Nirādiṣṭadhana*’, is the surety to whom enough money had been
handed over by the creditor, to cover the amount of surety
involved,—‘*alandhanaḥ*’, possessed of sufficient property,—the second
‘*nirādiṣṭa*’ stands for the son of the person who had stood surety and
has since died; the meaning being that the son should make good the debt
for which his father had stood surety.

162	If the surety had received money (from him for whom he stood bail) and had money enough (to pay), then (the heir of him) who received it, shall pay (the debt) out of his property; that is the settled rule.
