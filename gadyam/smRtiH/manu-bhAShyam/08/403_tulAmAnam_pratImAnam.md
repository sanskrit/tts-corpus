**तुला** प्रसिद्धा । **मानं** प्रस्थो द्रोण इत्यादि । **प्रतीमानं** सुवर्णादीनां परिच्छेदार्थं यत् क्रियते । सर्वतोभागे तत् **सुलक्षितं** राजचिह्नैर् अङ्कितं कार्यम् । स्वयं प्रत्यक्षेण परिच्छिद्य स्वमुद्रया । **परीक्षयेत् षट्सु षट्सु मासेषु पुनः** परीक्षां कारयेद् आप्तैर् अधिकारिभिर् यथा न विचालयन्ति केचित् ॥ ८.४०३ ॥

‘*Scales*’—well known.

‘*Weights*’—Seer, 2½ seers and so forth.

‘*Measures*’—whereby gold and other similar things are weighed.

All this should be duly marked—with the royal sign—on all sides; the
king should himself examine them and mark them with his own seal.

After every six months he should have them re-examined by his officers,
so that no one might tamper with them.—(403)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 301), which explains
‘*pratimānam*’ as prices of stone and other materials stamped with a
royal mark, which are used for determining the exact weight of gold;—and
in *Vyavaharā-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 940).
