**अविषह्या** निश्चेतुम् अशक्या, लिङ्गसाक्ष्यभावात् । **राजैव** स्वेच्छया **भूमिं** **प्रदिशेद्** दद्यात्- "इयं वो भूमिर् इयं वः" इति । **धर्मवित्** पक्षपातो नैव कस्यचित् कर्तव्य इति । एतद् आह **उपकाराद्** धेतोः । यया सीमया द्वाव् अपि ग्रामौ समोपकारौ भवतः । तेन यदि न्यूनापि कस्यचिद् भूमिः स्यात् क्षेत्रं चेत् सुगुणं बहूत्पत्तिकं तदपेक्षः प्रदेशः । ल्यब्लोपे पञ्चमी । उपकारम् अपेक्ष्य । 

अथ वा **एकेषां प्रदिशेद्** अपरेषाम् अनिश्चिताम् अपहरेत् । यदि विवादिग्रामस् तां सीमां यावद् वक्तुं न शक्नुयाद् इतरे च शक्तास् तदान्येभ्यः[^१८४] प्रदिशेत् । एवम् आत्मनो बहूनां च ग्रामीणानाम् उपकृतं भवति ॥ ८.२६५ ॥

‘*Unascertainable*’—incapable of being determined, on account of there
being no marks or witnesses available.

‘*The king himself*’— of his own will—‘*shall assign*’—make over—‘*their
lands*’; saying—‘this is your land, that is yours.’

‘*Righteous*’;—this is added with a view to point out that the king
shall not show partiality to any party.

‘*On the basis of advantages*’—*i.e*., according to considerations of
common good ; *i.e*., he shall indicate the boundary between the two
villages in such a manner as to make the decision equally advantageous
to both parties; so that if the field assigned to one party is less in
size, it is of better quality, being more fertile.

The ablative ending in ‘*upakārāt*’ has the force of the participal
affix; the term standing for the expression ‘*upakāram apekṣya*,’
‘taking into consideration the advantages.’

Or, the text may mean that, the land may be assigned to one party, being
taken away from the other party, whose rights over it are doubtful. In a
case where the complaining village is unable to indicate the boundary,
while the other party is able to do it, he shall assign the disputed
land to the latter. In this way a great benefit would be conferred upon
the king himself, as also upon a large number of villages.—(265)

This Verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.153), to the effect that between
the two villages (disputing over their boundary), the king shall allot
the disputed plot to that one to which it would be more useful than to
the other.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 764), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Aviṣahyā*’, without any means of determination, in the shape
persons or proofs,—‘*pravishet*’ (which is its reading for
‘*pradishet*’), is equivalent to ‘*praveśayet*,’ put into
possession,—‘*upakārāt*,’ on the ground of utility.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 216), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Aviṣahyā*’, unascertainable in the absence of
witnesses,—‘*ekeṣām pradishet upakārāt*,’ he should give it to one
party, on the ground of ‘utility’ *i*. *e*., to that party which is
likely to derive greater benefit from the land in dispute; when this
benefit is found to be equally possible for both parties, then he should
divide the land between both.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhavā* (Vyavahāra, p. 275), which explains
‘*aviṣahyā*’ as ‘there being neither witnesses nor any other indications
helping to determine it;’—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 31a);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 142,) which explains ‘*aviṣahyāyam*’ as
‘that for which no determinent is available in the shape either of
witnesses or marks.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2-153).—‘In the absence of persons conversant with the
boundary, and of boundary-marks, the lawful King himself shall determine
the boundary.’

*Nārada* (11.11, 27).—‘Should there he no persons conversant with the
true state of things, and no boundary-marks, then the King himself shall
fix the boundary between the two estates, as he thinks best.’

265	If the boundary cannot be ascertained (by any evidence), let a righteous king with (the intention of) benefiting them (all), himself assign (his) land (to each); that is the settled rule.
