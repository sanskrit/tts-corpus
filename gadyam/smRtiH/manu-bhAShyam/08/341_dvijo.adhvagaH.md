The text has used the term ‘*twice-born person*’ with a view to preclude
*Śūdras*.

‘*On a journey*’—*i.e*., not an inhabitant of the same village;—hut
there also he should be one ‘*who has run short of provisions*’—*i.e*.,
whose journey-rations have been exhausted.

‘*Two sugar-cane stalks*’ and ‘*two roots*’;—these are mentioned only by
way of illustration, indicating small quantities of green vegetables,
*mudga* -grains, leguminous grains and so forth. Says another
Smṛti-text—‘There is no prohibition regarding leguminous grains,
cucumber and grass.’

‘*From another man’s field*’—*i.e*., from a place belonging to another
person;—even though it be within an enclosure.—(341)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣara* (2.275), to the effect that there is
no punishment for way-farers stealing some little things on the way.
*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following notes:—‘*Adhvāga*,’
way-farer,—‘*kṣīṇavṛttiḥ*,’ with his food-supply exhausted.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 314);—in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 146), which explains ‘*kṣīṇavṛttiḥ*’ as having no
food for the journey;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 124).
