उक्तं सभां प्रविश्य व्यवहारान् पश्येद् इति । सभाशब्दश् च लोके गृहप्रासादविशेषे वर्तते "मयेन निर्मिता दिव्या सभा हेमपरिष्कृता" इति । क्वचित् पुरुषविशेषसंघटिता सभेति तन्निवृत्त्यर्थं सभाया लक्षणम् आह । यत्र त्रयो ब्राह्मणा वेदविदः संनिधीयन्ते, राज्ञश् च संबन्धी प्रकृतो ऽधिकृतो विद्वान् इति । अथ वा प्रकृतो ऽनन्तरश्लोके संनिहितः । सेह सभाभिप्रेता । ब्रह्मग्रहणं स्तुत्यर्थम् । यथा ब्रह्मणः सभा निरवद्यैवम् इयम्[^९०] अपीति ॥ ८.११ ॥

It has been declared that ‘having entered the Court, he shall look into
the cases.’ As regards the word ‘*sabhā*,’ in ordinary language it is
used in the sense of a particular apartment of the house; *e.g*., in the
Mahābhārata it is said that the ‘excellent gold-burnished *sabhā* was
built by Maya—sometimes it is also used in the sense of an assemblage of
particular men. In order to preclude these two meanings of the term, the
author states the definition of the ‘*Sabhā*,’ ‘Court,’ meant in the
present context.

That place where three Brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda are brought
together, as also the learned Brāhmaṇa appointed by the king,—or the
person mentioned in the preceding verse,—that is the ‘*Sabhā*’ meant
here.

The name of ‘*Brahman*’ has been mentioned for the purpose of extolling
the Court; the sense being that ‘the Court constituted as here stated is
as unexceptionable as that of Brahman himself.’—(11)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitāttva* (II, p. 199), to the effect that
the court becomes a true ‘Court,’ only by reason of the presence of the
duly qualified Brāhmaṇa-judge appointed by the king;—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Vyavahāra, p. 46), which explains ‘*prakṛtaḥ*’ as the *appointed*
judge;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (8b);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 36 and
11b), which says that no stress is meant to be laid upon the number
*three*, as the number may be larger, up to seven; what is meant is that
they shall not be less than three;—and in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 17a).

*Bṛhaspati* (1.11).—‘That assembly is equal in sanctity to a sacrificial
session in which there sit seven, or five or three Brāhmaṇas, who are
acquainted with the world, with the Veda and with Law.’

*Bṛhaspati* (1.5).—‘A Court of Justice is composed of ten members; and
an assembly of this sort, in which the King examines the cases
attentively, is comparable to a religious session.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.50-52).—‘The assembly in which there are seven, five,
or even three Brāhmaṇas versed in human affairs, the Vedas and the
Dharmaśāstras is like a sacrificial session.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.72).—‘The ten requisites in the administration of
justice are—the king, officers, councillors, smṛti-books, accountant,
clerk, gold, fire, water and one’s own men.’

*Nārada* (3.18).—‘That is not a court where there are no elders; they
are not elders who do not pass a just, sentence; that is not just
sentence where there is no truth; that is not truth which is vitiated by
error.’
