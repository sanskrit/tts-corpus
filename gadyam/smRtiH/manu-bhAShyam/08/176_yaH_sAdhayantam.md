‘*Will*’— wish; and ‘*by his own will*’ means ‘without filing his suit
with the king,’ just as he pleases,—not necessarily by the four
sanctioned methods of acquiring property;—if he is complained against,
and summoned by the king’s officers,—and then if the debtor, on being
questioned, should admit the debt, saying ‘I owe him such and such an
amount,’ then the latter should he fined a quarter of that debt, and the
total amount due he should be made to pay to the creditor ; *e.g*., if
he owes a *hundred*, he should he fined *twenty-five*, and should pay to
be creditor a *hundred*. We should not fall into the mistake that *a
hundred* less *twenty-five* is to be paid to the king and the balance,
*i.e*., twenty-fire to the creditor; as in this case the punishment
would fall upon the creditor and not upon the debtor.—(176)

*Viṣṇu* (6.18-19).—‘A creditor recovering the sum lent by any lawful
means shall not he reproved by the Xing. If the debtor, so forced to
discharge the debt, complains to the King, he shall be fined in an equal
sum.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.40).—‘If the creditor tries to realise the loan that is
admitted, he shall not he reproved by the King. If, on being thus
pressed to pay, the debtor approaches the King, he should he fined and
made to repay the amount due to the creditor.’

*Kātyāyana* (Aparārka, p. 645).—‘If the creditor harasses the debtor who
is acting lawfully, he shall forfeit the debt, and shall also be fined
the same amount.’

*Bṛhaspati* (11.54).—‘When a debtor has acknowledged a debt, it may he
recovered from him by the expedients of friendly expostulation and the
rest, by moral suasion, by artful management, by compulsion and by
confinement in the house.’

*Nārada* (1.122, 123).

\[122 is same as [Manu
8.49]\].—

‘A creditor who tides to recover his loan from the debtor must not he
checked by the King, both for secular and religious reasons.’
