The confiscation of his entire property is the penalty prescribed for
the Vaiśya. Though all the twice-born castes are mentioned together
here, yet the penalty here laid down is not meant for the case where the
*Vaiśya* has intercourse with a woman of the same caste; it is meant for
cases of intercourse with *Brāhmaṇa* and *Kṣatriya* women.

Similarly in the case of the *Kṣatriya* having intercourse with a
*Brāhmaṇa* woman, the punishment consists in a fine of one thousand, and
also ‘*shaving with urine*,’—*i.e*., the urine of the ass being used in
place of water.

Others explain the verse as follows:—Since no other caste is mentioned,
the punishment is meant for the case where the Vaiśya has intercourse
with a woman of the same caste,—the additional punishment being due to
his *keeping her for a year*. The sense is that if he keeps her for a
year then his punishment shall be as here laid down.

As a matter of fact however, the former explanation appears to be more
reasonable. It cannot be argued against it that—“the same punishment
cannot rightly apply to cases of intercourse with equal, superior and
inferior castes;” because it has been declared that ‘the wives of all
castes are to be guarded with the greatest care.’—(375)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 396), which adds the
following explanatory notes:—For having recourse to a guarded Brāhmaṇa
woman, the Vaiśya is to be imprisoned for one year and his entire
property is to be confiscated,—the Kṣatriya is to be fined 1000, and
shall have his head wetted with urine and then shaved;—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1009).
