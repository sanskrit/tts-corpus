<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The first half of the verse only re-iterates what has been said before,
and it is only the second half that puts forward something new. What had
been said in the first half of the preceding verse is exactly what is
meant by the first half of the present verse.

‘*Who having put forward a statement*,’—having said
something—‘*subsequently retracts*,’—deviates from it, saying

‘I am not sure about the time and place’.........,—ho also fails in his
suit.

Having once ‘*duly*’—with certainty, and clearly—‘*alleged a fact*’,—if,
‘*on being questioned about it*’—what do you means?—By what evidence do
you prove your case?’—if he loses faith in the allegation clearly made
by himself, and proceeds to talk about irrelevant matters, with the
motive that—‘after due investigation I am sure to lose the case, I may
just as well get over a little time,’—then such a person also fails in
his suit.

Or, the term ‘*apadeśa*’ may stand for *fraud*; the meaning being that
if after having set up a fraud, he slinks away from it, saying—‘I have a
severe headache now, I cannot answer any questions,’—or if he opens his
case with false statements,—then also he fails in his suit.—(54)

‘*Praṇihitam*’—‘Duly stated by himself’ (Kullūka and Nandana);—‘stated
by himself in the plaint’ (Govindarāja); ‘duly ascertained’
(Rāghavānanda and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* which has the following
notes:—‘*Apadiśya*’, having put forward,—‘*apadeśam*’,
pretext,—‘*apadhāvati*’,—retracts,—‘*samyak praṇihitam artham*,’ what
has been stated clearly and definitely,—‘*pṛsṭaḥ*’, questioned as to
what he has to say as against the statement of the other party, or what
proofs he has in support of his own statement;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 31b), which has the following explanations:—‘He who slinks
away from the court under some pretext’,—‘who does not pay heed—by
answering,—to what has been said by others, even though fully
comprehending what has been said’;—it quotes Medhātithi as reading
‘*adeśam*’ and reproduces his several explanations.
