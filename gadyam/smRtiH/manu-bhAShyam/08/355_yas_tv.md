If however the man is one who has not been previously accused or
suspected, and if the conversation is found to be one bearing upon
business, then there is no guilt, as in his case there is no
transgression.

But even though not previously accused, if he converses without any
business, he becomes liable to the aforesaid punishment.—(355)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 384), to the effect that
no blame is to be attached to, and no punishment inflicted in a case
where a man, not previously suspected, engages in such conversation for
other purposes;—in *Aparārka*, (p. 854), which explains ‘*doṣaiḥ*’
(which is its reading for ‘*pūrvam*’) as ‘such improper tendencies as a
longing for a particular woman and so forth’;—and in *Mitākṣarā*
(2.284), to the same effect.

*Bālambhaṭṭī* supplies a full explanation:—‘If the man is one who has
not been suspected of entertaining any improper desire towards a woman,
and he engages in conversation with that woman for some purpose, and in
the presence of other persons, then he should not be regarded as
culpable, since he has done nothing wrong.’

It is quoted in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (pp. 172-173) which has the same
explanation as the one just stated.
