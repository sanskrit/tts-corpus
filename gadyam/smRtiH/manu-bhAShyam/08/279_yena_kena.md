‘*Low-born man*’— from the *Śūdra* down to the *Caṇḍāla*.

‘*Superior person*’—belonging to the three higher castes.

If the former hurts the latter with any ‘limb,’—either directly, or
through the instrumentality of a stick or a sword or some such
weapon,—then ‘*that limb of his shall be cut off*.’

The term ‘*hiṃsā*’ (*hurt*) here stands for *striking in anger,
intentionally raising the hand or some weapon and letting it fall upon
another*,—and not actually *killing*.

The repetition of the pronoun ‘*tat tat*’ (‘every such’) is meant to
guard against the idea that only *one* limb is to be cut off, which
might arise from the use of the singular number in ‘*aṅgam*’ (‘limb’).
Hence in a case where the hurt is inflicted by several limbs, all these
limbs should be cut off.

‘*Teaching*’— advice. Such is the law laid down by Manu. This has been
added with a view to make a lenient king inflict the severe
punishment.—(279)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 258), which explains
‘*hiṃsyāt*,’ as ‘strikes,’—‘*śreyāṃsam*’ (which is its reading for
‘*checcreṣṭham*’) as ‘one of the three higher castes—and ‘*antyajaḥ*’ as
the ‘Śūdra’;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 146b).

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 100);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 288);—in *Aparārka* (p. 813), to the effect that the limb
should be cut off, if a, Śūdra causes pain to a Brāhmaṇa, or a Kṣatriya
or a Vaiśya;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (2.215), to the effect that if a Śūdra
causes pain to the Brāhmaṇa, or to the Kṣatriya, or to the Vaiśya, his
limb should be cut off; and adds that inasmuch as this lays down the
cutting of the limb of a Śūdra who strikes any *twice-born* person, it
follows, from the parity of reasoning, that this same punishment is to
be inflicted upon the Vaiśya striking the Kṣatriya. *Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following notes:—‘*Śreyāṃsam*,’ higher caste, twice-born
caste,—‘*antyaja*,’ he who is born of the *lower-most* (‘*antya*’) limb,
or one born of the lowest caste,—*i.e*., the Śūdra. This same rule is
applicable also to the Vaiśya striking the Kṣatriya, as the former is
‘*antyaja*’ ‘low-born,’ in comparison with the latter, who therefore is
‘*śreyān*,’ ‘superior.’

It is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 44b);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 75), which explains ‘*śreyāṃsam*’ (which
is its reading for ‘*śreṣṭham*’) as ‘the three higher castes,’ and
‘*antyaja*’ as ‘*Śūdra*.’

**(verses 8.279-280)  
**

*Gautama* (12.1).—‘A Śūdra who criminally assaults twice-born men with
blows shall he deprived of the limb with which he offends.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.19).—‘With whatever limb an inferior insults or hurts his
superior in caste, of that limb the King shall cause him to be
deprived.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.215).—‘That limb of a non-Brāhmaṇa with which he hurts
the Brāhmaṇa should he cut off. If he raises a weapon to strike him, he
shall pay a fine of the first degree; if he only touches the weapon,
then only half of that.’

*Ārthaśāstra* (p. 106).—‘By whatever limb the Śūdra strikes the
Brāhmaṇa, that limb should be cut off; if he only raises a weapon to
strike, some portion of a limb may be cut off; if he only touches the
weapon, the penalty shall be half of that.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 262).—‘For raising the hand to strike a
man of one’s own caste, the fine is 12 *Paṇas*; double of that for
actually striking him.’

*Nārada* (15-16.25).—‘With whatever limb a man of low caste offends a
Brāhmaṇa, that very limb of his shall be cut off; such shall be the
atonement for his crime.’
