He who appropriates the deposit placed with him, in the absence of
witnesses, and he who, having received it back, asks for it again,—both
these the king shall ‘*test*’;—‘*testing*’ stands for *trying to find
out the truth*,—by employing ‘*all methods*’;—‘*methods*’ stands for
*proofs*. So that if the man is found to have fallen from the path of
rectitude and denies the deposit,—then recourse may he had to heating
and imprisonment also; specially when the property involved is a large
one, the same methods have to be employed as in the case of thieves. But
no punishment shall lte inflicted if there is uncertainty in the matter.

The epithet ‘*prescribed in the scriptures*’ has been added only by way
of praise of the means to be employed.—(190)

‘*Sārvaiḥ upāyaiḥ*’—‘All kinds of evidence, the four expedients of
kindness and the rest, and also in the case of wicked people, beating
and imprisoning’ (Medhātithi, who is not rightly represented by
Buhler);—‘the four expedients of kindness and so forth’ (Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘spies and the like’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 208), as laying
down punishment for the depositor and depository if proved to be
dishonest;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*, (84a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 113a).
