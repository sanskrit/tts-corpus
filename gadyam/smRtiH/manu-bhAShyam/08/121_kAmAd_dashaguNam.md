‘*Lust*,’— sexual love: when females happen to be parties to the suit,
the person who loves one of them, deposes falsely; and such a person
should be fined 2,500 *Paṇas*.

‘*If through anger, three times the next*;’—the ‘lowest amercement’
having been mentioned before, its ‘next’ is the ‘middling amercement.’
Or, on the basis of ordinary usage, ‘*para*’ may stand for the
‘highest.’

‘*Through ignorance*’;—he who, through mistake, should say what is
contrary to busts, on the spur of the moment,—and not during his regular
examination,—his punishment shall consist of ‘*two hundred*.’ This is
meant to be merely suggestive of some sort of punishment to be
inflicted; and hence it is not contrary (to what has been declared
regarding the *lowest fine* to consist of 250).

‘*Childishness*’— is *childish character*. The man who has not acquired
steadiness of mind is called ‘childish.’ The punishment here laid down
is for one who has just passed his minority; one who is still a minor
cannot be a witness at all.—(121)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 680);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.81),
which adds the following notes:—‘*Ajñāna*’ is imperfect knowledge,—and
‘*bāliśya*’, want of experience and knowledge;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra p. 82);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 191), which says—‘If the
witness lies through sexual passion for some woman, he should be fined
2,500 *paṇas*,—if through anger, 2,000 *paṇas*,—if through ignorance,
200 *paṇas*’;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (37b), which says ‘*triguṇam
param*’ means ‘three times the *middle* amercement’, *i.e*., 1,500
*paṇas*,—*ajñānāt*’, from a wrong idea formed at the time of the
transaction in question,—‘*bāliśya*’ means ‘majority just attained’, a
*minor* not being admissible as a witness.
