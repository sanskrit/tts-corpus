‘*Original inhabitants*’—The epithet has been added with a view to
indicate their importance. Those persons who were living in the village
at the time of its foundation, and who are co-eval with it, are called
‘original’; such inhabitants of the neighbouring villages remain on the
spot constantly. There would be ‘absence’ of these, on account of their
having become dispersed, for some reason or the other.

What is the remedy, if these are not available?

In that case the king shall question ‘*these*’—the persons going to be
mentioned in the next verse.

Or, ‘*maulāḥ*’ may be taken to mean ‘experienced.’—‘*Sāmantāḥ*’ as
explained above. And the meaning may he—‘In the absence of experienced
people, ordinary neighbours may he regarded as reliable authority, and
in the absence of these latter, the frequenters of forests should he
carefully examined.’—(259)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 209), which explains
‘*maulāḥ*’ as ‘persons who have lived in the village ever since it came
into existence,’—and ‘*anuyuñjīta*’ as ‘should question’;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyvahāra, p. 272);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
790);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (111b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
140b), which says that the foresters and others are to be asked only
when there are no such persons available as are cultivators of lands
lying near the disputed boundary.
