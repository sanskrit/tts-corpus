Other such-like things which the earth may not eat up in time,—these he shall secretly set up on junctions of boundaries.—(251)

The ‘*thicket*’ and other things have been mentioned only by way of
illustration; and not for the purpose of excluding other things; since
such trees as the *Khadira*, the *Sāra*, the *Kālāñjana* and so
forth,—as also things similar to the ‘*pebble*’—are also used.

The text adds what is meant by ‘*such-like*’—‘*which* *the earth may not
eat up in time*.’ ‘*Eating-up*’ is used figuratively, for *corroding*.
Just as what has been *eaten up* cannot be differentiated from other
things, so also what has become obliterated by the corrosion of the
earth.—(251)

“According to Kullūka, who relies on a passage of Bṛhaspati, these
objects are to be placed in jars.” (Buhler.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2-151), whereon *Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following notes:—‘*Yāni*’ other things similar to those just
mentioned,—‘*sīmāyām*’, on the boundary that has got to be
marked,—‘*sandhi*’, meeting point of the boundaries.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 203), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Evamprakārāṇi*,’ such as pebbles and so forth;—and in
‘*Vivādacintāmaṇi*’ (p. 93).

251	And whatever other things of a similar kind the earth does not corrode even after a long time, those he should cause to be buried where one boundary joins (the other).
