‘*Gods*’—Durgā, Sūrya and the rest, set up in the form of images.

‘*Purified*,’—*i.e*., who have performed the rites of bathing,
mouth-rinsing and so forth.

‘*Pure*,’—the judge himself should have purified himself in the same
way.

‘*Truth*,’—this is a mere re-iteration of what is already implied; and
it servos the purpose of filling up the metre.—(87)
