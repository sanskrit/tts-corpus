<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Treasure secretly buried under the ground is called ‘*nidhi*,’
‘*treasure-trove*.’ There are treasure-troves that have lain under the
ground for a hundred, or even a thousand years. If, when the ground is
being dug, such a treasure-trove is somehow found by some one, it
belongs to the state. As says Gautama (10.43)—‘Treasure-trove when found
is state-property.’ But this applies only to the case of a
treasure-trove the original hoarder of which is not known. And with
regard to this it has been laid down that one who reports the find is to
receive the sixth part of it.

The present verse refers to the case where the original hoarder is
either the person reporting the find himself or a descendant of his.

‘*If a man says* “*this is mine*” *truly*’—*i.e*., on reliable
evidence,—‘*from him the King shall take the* *sixth part*’—at which the
King’s share is fixed. That is, the King is to take the sixth part out
of that treasure-trove of which the rightful owner has been discovered
with certainty.

The option regarding the ‘sixth’ or ‘twelfth’ part is based upon the
qualities of the finder.—(35)

The amount to be taken depends ‘upon the character of the finder’
(Medhātithi, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda),—or ‘on the caste of the finder’
(Nārāyaṇa),—or, ‘on the time, place, the caste of the finder and so
forth’ (Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 641), which adds that the amount
of the royalty shall be determined in due accordance with the character
(of the claimant, and of the treasure);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.34-35),
which notes that the proportion of the royalty is to be determined by
considerations of the caste of the claimant, the nature of the place and
time and such other details;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 642), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Nidhi*’ here stands for ‘treasure buried
underground long ago and forgotten’,—whether the king shall receive the
sixth or twelfth part shall depend upon the virtuous character or
otherwise of the person claiming it.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 88), which appears to take the
meaning to be that the king shall take the sixth part for the state,
*and also* the twelfth part for the person who discovered the treasure.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 269), which adds that the
exact proportion shall depend upon the time and upon the qualifications
of the owner of the treasure;—and that this refers to treasure belonging
to others than the Brāhmaṇas.

*Viṣṇu* (3.63).—‘Of treasure anciently hidden by themselves, men of all
castes excepting Brāhmaṇas, shall give a twelfth part to the King.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.35).—‘When some one has discovered hidden treasure, the
King shall take the sixth part of it. In cases where the find is not
reported to the King, on coming to know of it, he shall take the whole
of it, and also fine the finder.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.13).—‘If anyone finds treasure, the owner of which is not
known, the King shall take it, giving one-sixth to the finder.’

*Gautama* (10.43-45).—‘Treasure-trove is the property of the
King,—excepting such as is found by a Brāhmaṇa who lives according to
the law. Some people declare that a finder belonging to a
non-Brāhmaṇical caste also, who reports the find to the King, shall
obtain the sixth part of its value.’

*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 343).—‘If a man finds treasure hidden by
some one else, he shall take it to the King; all treasure-trove, to
whomsoever it may have belonged, should go to the King; except that
belonging to the Brāhmaṇa.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, pp. 269-270).—‘Having
obtained a treasure-trove, the King shall keep half of it in his
Treasury; and the other half the righteous King shall make over to
Brāhmaṇas.’
