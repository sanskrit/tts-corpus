If a maiden ‘*approaches*’—has sexual intercourse with—‘a *superior
person*’—one whose caste, wealth, character, learning is superior to
that of her father’s family,—she shall not be fined anything.

In as much as the girl is never her own mistress, the punishment would
fall upon her guardians, father and others; and it is the punishment
that is precluded here.

‘*Inferior*—in caste or other things.

‘*Courts*,’—tries to have intercourse with.

‘*Confined*,’—not being allowed to take part in any amusements, and
guarded by attendants.

She shall be made to live in her father’s house, till she gets rid of
her love-longings. If however she continues to have her love centred in
the inferior persons, then she should be kept confined till her last
breath.—(365).

‘*Samyatām*’—‘Kept away from amusements and guarded by chamberlains’
\[not ‘relatives’ as stated by Buhler\] (Medhātithi);—‘bound’
(Nārāyaṇa). Kullūka is misrepresented by Buhler: he says nothing about
‘fettering’; he only says that she is to be kept in the house ‘with
care’.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 404), which explains
‘*Sāvamānām*’ as ‘winning him over to herself for the purposes of sexual
intercourse’,—and ‘*samyatām*’ as ‘imprisoned.’
