‘*To them*’—*i.e*., to the depositors employed by the Judge;—if he
should not restore ‘*that gold*’—which was placed in deposit;—‘*in the
proper manner*,’—this is exactly what has been spoken of in the
preceding verse by the phrase ‘*in the form in which it was
entrusted*’;—then ‘*he*’—the Receiver—‘*shall be forced*’— by the
officers of the King—‘to *restore both*’—the deposit of the plaintiff,
as also that of the King.

‘*Such is the decree*’—declaration—‘*of the law*.’

What this means has already been explained.—(184)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 664), which explains the meaning
to be that the man should be punished by being made to surrender the two
deposits as also their values.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 94) which explains the meaning to
be as follows—“If, however, the man does not surrender the gold
deposited by the king’s spies, then the king should regard the charge as
proved against him and should make him surrender also the former
deposit, the subject-matter of the former charge.”

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 209), to the
effect that if, relying on his power, the depository does not surrender
the deposit, he should be punished by the king and forced to deliver it.
