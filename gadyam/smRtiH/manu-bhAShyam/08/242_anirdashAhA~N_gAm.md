The present verse lays down an exception to what has been said above.

Since the text speaks of the ‘*cow*,’ it follows that, in the case of
other animals, such as the buffalo and the like, the wrong done is
cognisable. The term ‘*vṛṣāh*’ stands for *bulls*.

‘*Dedicated cattle*,’—such cattle as have been selected by a sacrificer
for being used at an impending sacrificial performance. Or the term
‘*deva*’ may stand for the images of Viṣṇu, Śiva or other Gods installed
within brick-structures; and such ‘cattle’ as may have been presented to
these ‘Gods’ would be called ‘*dedicated cattle*’; as in such cases
there would be a relation of possession and possessed between the ‘Gods’
and the ‘cattle.’

What is declared here pertains to such cattle as serve as ornaments of
temples; and not to those that are only brought there for the purpose of
their milk being offered to the temple. Because in the case of the
latter, it is the keepers that offer the milk to the Gods, and hence are
the ‘owners’ of the cattle; so that these have to be regarded as on the
same footing as other owners. On the other hand, those that serve as
ornaments to the temple have been presented to the temple, and as such
come to be regarded as being ‘dedicated cattle.’

Some people hold that the term ‘*vṛṣāh*’ stands for such bulls as have
been let off, in connection with the ceremony of *Vṛṣotsarga*.

Such cattle—whether they be ‘*with keepers*,’ or not belonging to any
one and hence ‘*without keepers*’—are not to be penalised.—(242)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara'* (p. 239), which explains
‘*deva-paśu*’ as ‘cattle dedicated to the gods’;—in *Aparārka* (p.
771);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 268), which explains ‘*vṛṣa*’
as (*a*) ‘*mahokṣa*,’ *i*.*e*., ‘large bull,’ or (*b*) ‘bulls dedicated
by the rite called *vṛṣotsarga*’;—and in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 530), which
adds that the cattle mentioned here, if they do any damage, are simply
to be driven away;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 811);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta p. 68), which explains ‘*vṛṣān*’ as
‘breeding bulls.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.150).—‘If the damage has been done by bulls that have been
set at liberty, or by a cow shortly after her calving (there is no
offence).’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.163).—‘The Big Bull, cattle consecrated and let loose,
a cow newly calved, stray strange cattle, or those perturbed by
visitations of the King or of Fate,—these shall ho set at liberty
(without punishment), even though they he accompanied by the keeper (at
the time of grazing).’

*Uśanas* (Aparārka, p. 771).—‘Elephants and horses are not to he
punished; as also a strange cow, or one newly calved; or one that has
strayed from the herd, and all cows at the time of rejoicings or
Śrāddhas.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do., p. 772).—‘In the matter of punishing the grazing of
cattle, of the highest, lowest and middlemost kinds, the King shall
inflict fines only in the event of the owner of the field complaining
about it.’

*Nārada* (11.30, 32, 33).—‘A cow within ten days of her calving, a big
bull, a horse and an elephant shall he kept off carefully. The owner of
any one of them is not liable to punishment for doing any damage. The
owners of elephants and horses shall not pay any fine. Impunity is
likewise granted to the owner of the strayed cow, of one that has
recently calved, or of one that is uncontrollable;—as also the owner of
one that has lost her way, or broken down, or stuck in the marsh, or a
bull marked by the sign of consecration.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 60).—‘The village-bull, the consecrated bull, the cow
within ten days of calving, old hulls and breeding bulls shall not be
punished.’
