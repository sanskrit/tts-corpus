<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Śukranīti* (4.5.16).—‘The King who does not perform his civic duties
well certainly rots in hell.’

*Nārada* (3.89),—‘Where justice is slain by injustice and truth by
falsehood, the members of the court, who look on with indifference,
become doomed to destruction. When justice, hit by injustice, enters a
court, and the members do not extract the dart from the wound, they are
hit by it themselves.’

*Bṛhaspati* (1. 34-36).—‘Of the Tree of Justice, the Brāhmaṇa is the
root, the King is the stem and branches, the ministers are its loaves
and blossoms, just government is its fruit;—renown and wealth are the
sap of its fruit; a dignified station, invincibility, esteem among men,
and eternal residence in Heaven constitute the enjoyment of its
fruit.—Having recognised these advantages in justice, the King should be
equitable towards litigants, and should pass a just sentence, discarding
avarice and other evil propensities.’

*Kātyāyana* (Smṛticandrikā, p. 47).—‘Where a decision is taken by
councillors against the laws, there justice is slain by injustice. If
the king happens to be inclined to act unjustly, the councillors shall
not remain neutral; if they do remain neutral, they become degraded.’

012	But where justice, wounded by injustice, approaches and the judges do not extract the dart, there (they also) are wounded (by that dart of injustice).
