‘*Custom houses*’ are those places where duties and tolls are realised,
as fixed by the king and the merchants in accordance with the special
conditions of each country. Those who have experience of these are the
‘custom-house officials’; these men cannot be hoodwinked by clever
rogues.

Similarly there are men who are ‘*experts in all kinds of merchandise*,’
*i.e*., who know all about the demand and supply, the good and bad
qualities and such details regarding all commodities.

When things are brought by merchants in boxes from other countries, the
said experts fix their prices; and of this price the king shall take the
twentieth part.

“What is the use of the valuation? It would be enough to say that the
king shall receive the twentieth part of each commodity.”

This would be all right in cases where the king realises his dues *in
kind*. But in the case of such cloth-pieces as are used in the form in
which they are sold, the twentieth part could not be taken without
tearing each piece. Hence it is that valuation becomes necessary.

In the case of unsaleable commodities, or of articles meant for personal
use, there are no duties, hence the text adds the term ‘*yathā-paṇyam*,’
‘*saleable commodities*.’

The valuation has to be done in accordance with several considerations
of time, place and other circumstances; for instance, all commodities do
not sell at the same price at all times; so that the price of any
article cannot be regarded as fixed for all time.—(398)

‘*Tataḥ*’—‘Of the amount thus fixed’ (Medhātithi);—‘out of the profit on
that amount’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 304), which remarks that
this refers to commodity. imported from other countries;—in *Aparārka*
(p. 833);—in *Vīramitrodaya*, (Rājanīti, p. 164), which adds that,
though from the words it would seem that the twentieth part of the value
of the commodity is meant, yet, in fact, it is of the profit over and
above the value fixed; for if the king were to take the twentieth part
of the value, then the trader would have no profit at all, and his
business would be ruined;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*, (p. 954.)

*Yājñavalkya* (2.261).—‘The King shall take as duty the twentieth part
of the price fixed for each commodity.’

*Gautama* (10.26).—‘In the case of merchandise one-twentieth should be
paid as duty.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.18.14-15).—‘The duty on goods imported by sea is, after
deducting a choice article, ten *Paṇas* in the hundred. He shall also
lay just duties on other marketable goods, according to their intrinsic
value, without oppressing the traders.’

*Arthaśāstra* (I, p. 241).—‘The trade-commissioner shall keep himself
informed of the prices and the demand for commodities got out of the
earth and those got out of the water, imported by land and by
water;—also of the time for their collection and disposal. Of such
commodities as are found in large quantities, he shall fix the price
after collecting them in one place. Of commodities produced in his own
country, the commissioner shall establish an emporium with a single
outlet; of those imported from outside, there shall be an emporium with
several outlets; and the sale of those kinds of commodities shall he so
arranged as to be most helpful to the people of the country. Even large
profits he shall forego if it injures the people...... In the case of
commodities sold by measures of capacity, 16 per cent, shall be the duty
payable to the King; 20 per cent, in the case of things sold by weight;
11 per cent, in that of things sold by the number. Exports from outside
he shall encourage by favourable treatment. To sea-going and land
merchants he shall grant concessions and advances and help in other
ways.’

*Viṣṇu* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 304),—‘In the case of commodities produced
in the country itself, the King shall levy a duty in the shape of the
tenth part; and in that of those imported from outside, the twentieth
part.’
