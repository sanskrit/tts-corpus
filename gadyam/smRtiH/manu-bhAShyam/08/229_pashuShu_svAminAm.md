<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In regard to ‘*cattle*’— such as cows and the like—there may be some
‘*transgressions*’; and from those may arise ‘*disputes between their
owners and keepers*’;—the owner saying—‘you have destroyed my cow, give
her to me’;—on which the keeper retorts—‘There was no neglect on my
part.’ The ‘*true law*’—the established rule—that governs such
disputes—that ‘*I am going to describe fully*.’

This summing up of the sense of the entire section is put forth for the
purpose of securing the attention of the audience.—(229)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 170), which adds that
‘*paśuṣu*’ stands for such cattle as form the subject-matter of
dispute;—in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Vyavahāra, p. 262), which explains
‘*vivādam*’ as method of settling the dispute;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(104 b).

**(verses 8.229-230)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (5.137-138).—‘Cattle being attacked, during daytime, by wolves
or other ferocious animals, and the keeper not going to repel the
attack, the blame shall fall upon him;—and he shall make good to the
owner the value of the cattle that may have perished.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.164).—‘The cowherd shall deliver, in the evening, the
cattle exactly as they had been made over to him; if any cattle dies or
becomes lost through his negligence, the hired cowherd should be made to
replace them.’

*Nārada* (6.11-13).—‘Those cows which a cowherd takes to the pasture
every day when the night is over, he shall bring back again in the
evening, after they have eaten and drunk. If such a cow meets with an
accident, he shall struggle to save her as best he may; if he is unable
to rescue her, he shall go quickly to announce it to his master. Should
he neither struggle to save her, nor raise a cry, nor announce it to his
master, the cowherd shall make good the value of the cow to the owner,
and must pay a fine to the King.’

*Bṛhaspati* (16.20).—‘A cowherd saves cattle from danger of reptiles,
robbers and tigers, and from caverns or pits; let him try his best to
protect them, call out for help, and give notice to his master.’
