Where, however, the person deserving of censure is actually censured, there the king becomes sinless, the members of the court become freed, and the sin falls upon the perpetrator.—(19)

एष एवार्थो विपर्ययेणोच्यते । यत्र दोषवान् दोषं गोपयितुं न लभते प्रकटीक्रियते तदीयो दोषः, तत्र सर्वं साधु संपद्यत इति । "यत्र धर्मः" (म्ध् ८.१४) इत्य् अत आरभ्य मिथ्यादर्शनोपेक्षणप्रतिषेधार्थं निन्दाप्रशंसाभ्यां शुभाशुभफलदर्शनार्था अर्थवादाः ॥ ८.१९ ॥

The same idea is stated conversely.

Where the guilty person is not able to hide his guilt, and his guilt is
duly exposed, then everything turns out to be right.

From verse 14 onwards we have a set of supplementary exaggerations,
containing praises and condemnations indicating the good and bad
results,—put forward for the purpose of forbidding the actual committing
of injustice, as also the conniving at it (being committed by others).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 604);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 26), to the effect that the king becomes absolved from
all sin if he shows complete impartiality;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 200)
which adds the following notes:—‘*Kartāram*’ means the ‘speaker’, the
perjuror,—the term ‘*rājā*’ here stands for the Judge, —‘*anenāḥ*’ means
‘free from sin’;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 48);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 5a).

*Nārada* (3.13).—‘The King is freed from responsibility, the members of
the Court obtain their absolution, and the guilt rests on the
offender,—when the guilty person is punished.’

*Bodhāyana* (1.19.8).—‘When he who deserves condemnation is condemned,
the King is guiltless and the judges free from blame; the guilt falls on
the offender alone.’

*Hārita*( Vyavahāratattva).—(Same as Manu.)

019	But where he who is worthy of condemnation is condemned, the king is free from guilt, and the judges are saved (from sin); the guilt falls on the perpetrator (of the crime alone).
