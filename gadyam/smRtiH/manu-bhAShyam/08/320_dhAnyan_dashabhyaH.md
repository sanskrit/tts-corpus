The term ‘*jar*’ is used in the sense of a particular measure, and not
in that of one *jarful* only. The exact quantity is sometimes 20 seers,
and in others 22 seers according to the custom of the place.

He who steals more than ten ‘jars,’ should be punished with
‘immolation.’ This rule is relaxed in accordance with the circumstances
attending each case.

‘*In* *the rest*,’—*i.e*., in the case of ten jars and less,—the fine
shall be eleven times the quantity stolen.

‘*The property shall be made good to the owner*’;—this applies to all
cases of theft.

‘*Grain*’—under this term are included seventeen things—the *Vrīhi*, the
*Yava* and so forth,—as mentioned in the *Smṛtis*.—(320)

‘*Kumbha*’—‘Equivalent to 20 or 22 *Prasthas* of 32 *Palas* each’
(Medhātithi);—‘to 2 *Droṇas* of 200 *Palas* each’ (Govindarājā, Kullūka
and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 513), where, Kātyāyana is
quoted as making ‘*kumbha*’ equivalent to 20 *droṇas*;—in *Aparārka* (p.
846), which has the following notes:—The *kumbha* is equivalent 52
*droṇas*;—‘*vadha’* is to be inflicted on the man who steals more than
20 *kumbhas* of paddy; in ‘other cases’—*i.e*., where the quantity
stolen is not large—the thief should be made to pay a fine which is
eleven times that which is prescribed for cases of stealing paddy (?);
and the quantity stolen has to be restored to the owner.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.275) as indicating the fact that the
penalty varies with the quantity of grain stolen; it adds the following
notes:—The *kumbha* is equal to 20 *droṇas*,—whether the ‘*vadha*’
prescribed here is to be *beating* or *mutilation* or *death* shall
depend upon (1) the qualities of the thief, of the corn stolen and of
the owner of the corn, and (2) upon the time, whether it is a time of
scarcity or plenty;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 151a), which
explains ‘*kumbha*’ as 10 *seers*, ‘*śeṣe*’ as ‘less than ten
kumbhas—‘*tasya*’ as ‘to the owner of the grain.’

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 311), which has the following
notes:—The *kumbha* consists of 10 *prasthas*,—‘*śeṣe*’, less than 10
*kumbhas*,—the property that had been stolen should be restored to the
owner.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 101), which explains ‘*kumbha*’
as 10 *prasthas*;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 341), which says that
this refers to eases of serious crime.

*Viṣṇu* (5.12).—‘Those who steal more than 10 *kumbhas* of grain, should
be put to death.’

*Nārada* (Theft: 26).—‘Corporal punishment or death shall he inflicted
on him who steals more than 10 *kumbhas* of grain; when the quantity is
less, he shall be made to pay eleven times the value—thus has Manu
ordained.’
