<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse introduces the head of ‘Joint Concerns’: and as an example,
the author takes up the ease of ‘Joint action’ at Vedic rites.

‘*Sacrifice*’—The Jyotiṣṭoma and the rest. For the proper performance of
the numerous details of these sacrifices, when a certain ‘*priest has
been appointed*,’—with the words—‘you should perform the duties of the
‘*Hotṛ*,’ or ‘of the *Adhvaryu*,’ or ‘of the *Udgātṛ*,’—and the further
condition is made—‘you should do the work according to the
*śrauta-rules*’;—if, on account of his inefficiency or other causes, he
happens to abandon it after it has been half-done,—then the share of the
sacrificial fee payable to him shall be in accordance with the amount of
work done by him. For instance, if the man goes away after having done
only a fourth part of his work, he should be paid the quarter of the
third part of the entire ‘fee’ prescribed in connection with the
particular sacrifice concerned. This would be ‘*in accordance with the
work done*.’

‘*By h* *is* *associates*’—*i.e*., the other priests, the *Hotṛ*, the
*Udgātṛ* and the rest.—(206)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 836);—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p.
118), which adds the following notes:—‘*Svakarma parihāpayet*,’ *i.e*.,
through sickness or such causes, a part of the sacrificial fee shall be
paid to him, after duly considering the total fee payable for the entire
sacrifice and the part of the work that may have been done by him;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 222), which explains ‘*sahakartṛbhiḥ*’
as ‘by his colleagues’;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 48), which says that
‘if a priest, through disease or other disability, is unable to perform
his work, then he is to be paid his fee in proportion to the work
actually done by him;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (89b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 120a), which explains ‘*sahakartṛbhiḥ*’ as ‘by his
collaborators,’—or the meaning may be ‘he should be paid his share of
the fee, *along with*, at the same time as, the other priests are paid.’

[(See Manu below,
388.)]

*Yājñavalkya* (2.265).—‘Among a company of joint workers, if one happen
to be dishonest, the others should expel him without payment; if he
happen to omit his share of the work on account of his inability to do
it, then he should have it done by another. This same rule applies to
the case of sacrificial priests, cultivators and artisans.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 836).—‘If the Sacrificial Priest fails to
officiate at a sacrifice, or if a Teacher fails to teach, he should be
abandoned; one becomes degraded if he abandons them in other
circumstances.’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 836).—‘If the Sacrificial Priest happen to be in
trouble, some one else may officiate for him and receive a proportionate
share out of the fee payable to the former.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 117).—‘From among men employed in a
common work, if one happen to die, his share of the work should be done
by a relation of his, or by his colleagues collectively.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Do.).—‘If on the approach of the *Savana*, a priest
should happen to die, what should be done is that his work should be
completed by his *Sagotra* or by his pupil; if he has no relations, then
the sacrificer should appoint another Priest.’
