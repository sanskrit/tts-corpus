The ‘*weaver*’ is one who weaves yarns, and makes clot? (cloth?) for
garments, etc.

When he has received ‘*ten palas*’ of yarn, he should return a piece of
cloth weighing one more ‘*pala*.’ He should make his repayments at this
rate of interest. Special considerations may be made in regard to the
coarseness or fineness of the texture of the cloth, or to the fact of
its being wooly and so forth.

Otherwise there shall be a fine of twelve ‘*paṇas*.’

This punishment is to be inflicted in the case of non-payment of the
*interest*. In the case of non-payment of the *principal*, he would have
to pay according to the rule laid down by the guild.

Thus in the case of the principal consisting of ‘*twenty palas*’ of
yarn, if the man does not pay the interest, his fine shall he double;
and so on, the fine being computed triple, quadruple and so forth.

Others hold that the fine is to be paid to the king.—(397)

‘*Dvādaśakam*’—‘*Twelve paṇas*’ (Kullūka and Medhātithi, who does not
say ‘*palas*,’ as asserted by Buhler);—‘twelve times the value of the
yarn’(Govindarāja);—‘one-twelth of the value of the yarn’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 785), which explains
‘*dvādaśakam*’ as ‘fine consisting of 12 *kārṣāpaṇas*’;—and in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 311), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Tantuvāya*,’ the weaver of cloth, having received 10 *palas* of
yarn, shall, after weaving it, give to the owner cloth weighing 11
*palas*; otherwise acting,—*i.e*., having received 10 *palas* of yam, if
he gives cloth weighing only 10 *palas*,—he should pay a fine. It adds
that this rule refers to coarse yams.

*Yājñavalkya* (2.179-180).—‘In the matter of woolen and cotton yarns, of
the ordinary counts, the increase is 10 *Palas* per 100 *Palas*; it is 5
*Palas* per 100, when the yarns are of the middling count; and 3 *Palas*
per cent, in the case of very fine yarns. In the case of clothes that
are embroidered, or worked with wool, the loss in weight is the
thirtieth part; in the case of garments of silk or of bark, there is
neither increase nor decrease.’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 784, and Vivādaratnākara, p. 312).—‘In the case
of cotton and woolen cloth, there is an increase of 10 *Palas* per cent
.; this in the case of thick yarns; in the case of yarns of middle
counts it is 5 *Palas* per cent; and in that of fine yarns, it is only 3
*Palas* per cent. In the case of cloth that is embroidered or
wool-worked, there is a decrease by the thirtieth part. In the case of
cloth of silk or of bark, there is neither decrease nor increase.’
