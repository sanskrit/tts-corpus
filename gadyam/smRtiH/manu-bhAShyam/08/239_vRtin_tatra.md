‘*Enclosure*’—is the name given to a fencing of thorns and twigs that is
put up round fields and gardens for the preventing of the entrance of
cattle; in some places this is called ‘*parṇikā*.’

The height of this enclosure should be such that the camel shall not
look over it.

“Is the accusative ending in ‘*yām*,’ ‘*which*,’ used in the sense of
the Instrumental?” Our answer is—*no*.

“How then would be the camel not see the *enclosure*?”

If it is very high, its other side being not visible, the enclosure is
as good as *not seen*.

All the openings should also he closed,—such openings as can he entered
by the head of the dog or the hog; *i.e*, the gaps that may be of the
size of the head of these animals: the sense is that every effort should
be made so that their head may not be thrust in.—(239)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.162) as laying down the necessity
of fencing fields and gardens; and *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following
notes:—‘*Tatra*’, round the field,—the fence should be so high that even
a tall animal like the camel should not be able to see the crops from
the other side;—‘*mukhānugam*’, enabling the mouth of the dog or the hog
lo reach the crops,—‘*mukhonantam*’ is another reading;—the meaning is
as “follows:—One should build a fence, like a wall, round the field,
which should be so high that the camel may not be able to see the crops;
and if there are any holes there, large enough to enable the dog or the
hog to thrust its mouth into it, then all these should be securely
closed up: If we read ‘*vā vārayet*’, then the second half is to be
taken as laying down another method of having the fence.

*Nārada* (11.41).—‘On that side of the field which faces the road, a
fence shall ho made, over which a camel cannot look, nor horses or

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 233).—‘Round a field situated on
