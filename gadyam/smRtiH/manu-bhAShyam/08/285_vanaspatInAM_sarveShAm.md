In the case of all trees, as their usefulness so should be the punishment inflicted for injuring them; this is the settled rule.—(285)

The ‘*trees*’ have been mentioned as representing all immovable things.

When injury is done to a tree which is of great utility, the fine
consists of the ‘highest amercement’; when the tree is of ordinary
utility, it consists of the ‘middle amercement’; and when it is of small
utility, it consists of the ‘lowest amercement.’

Account has also got to be taken of the part of the tree where the
injury is done;—whether it is the leaf, the fruit or the branch that has
been cut off. In regard to fruits also, their market-value has to be
taken into consideration.

Similarly account has to be taken of the position of the tree,—whether
it stands on the boundary, on road-crossings or in a hermitage, and so
on.—(285)

“According to Govindarāja the fine for injuring trees which give shade
only is to be very small; in the case of flower-bearing trees, middling;
and in the case of fruit trees, high.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 100);—and in *Aparārka*
(p. 819).

*Viṣṇu* (5.55-59).—‘A feller of trees yielding fruit shall pay the
highest amercement; a feller of flower-bearing trees, only the middle
amercement; he who cuts creepers, shrubs or climbing plants shall pay a
hundred *kārṣāpaṇas*; he who cuts grass shall pay one *kārṣāpaṇa*; and
all such offenders shall make good to the owners the revenue which they
yield.’

*Arthaśāstra* (pp. 108-109).—‘One who destroys small things shall make
good their value and also pay a line equal to it;—on destroying large
things, he shall make good their value and pay double that amount as
fine.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.227-229).—‘For tearing the branches of wide-spreading
trees, and of such trees as supply food, the fine shall he 20; for
tearing their trunks, 40, and for destroying the entire tree, 80. For
such trees as are growing on places of worship, in the cremation-ground,
in a sacred place, or in a temple, the fine shall be double. Half of the
above-mentioned fine, in the case of destroying thickets, creepers and
plants.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 286).—‘For the purpose of making
agricultural implements or implements for the household, one may cut
even fruit-bearing and flower-bearing trees and thickets.’
