**भिक्षुका** भिक्षाजीविनो भिक्षायाचनारूपं संभाषणम् **अवारिताः** **कुर्युर्** यदि स्वामिना न निषिद्धाः । अथ वा नैते वारयितव्याः । **बन्दिनः** स्तावकाः । **दीक्षिता** यज्ञे भृतिवचनार्थं संभाषेरन् । **कारवः** सूपकारादयः । एते तीर्थादिष्व् अपि न निवार्याः ॥ ८.३६० ॥

‘*Mendicants*,’— those living on alms; these may talk to women, in the
act of begging, if they are not ‘*checked*’ by their husbands.

Or, the meaning may be that they shall not be checked or forbidden in
this.

‘*Bards*,’—those who sing the praises of kings.

‘*Initiated at a rite*,’—These persons would have to speak to women in
the course of the response that they have to make in acceptance of their
appointment.

‘*Craftsmen*,’—cooks and others.

These should not be prevented even at such places as the watering-place
and the like.—(360)
