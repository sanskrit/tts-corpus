The judges should not entertain any such idea as the following—‘Between
the plaintiff and the defendant, one or the other is taking what belongs
to the other,—so that he will incur the sin of wrongful possession of
the land,—we are not committing the act,—why then should we be
participators in the sin?’ Because as a matter of fact, the said sin is
divided into four parts.

This verse is a purely supplementary exaggeration; because in reality
the sin committed by one man does not go to another. What happens then
is that on the judges also falls the sin of transgressing the law that
forbids unjust decisions. On the king, though he does not personally
investigate the case, there does fall the sin resulting from the sinful
act of the judges appointed by him and acting as his representatives. Or
if, on being apprised, by the defeated party, of the unfair dealings of
the authorised judges, he does not punish the dishonest officer, and
does not take steps to come to a just decision, then also he becomes a
participator in the sin. Or, the ‘*King*’ in the text may be taken as
standing for the judge appointed by him; the sense being that when the
king himself decides the case wrongly, the sin falls upon him, whereas
when his representative does so, the sin falls upon the latter.—(18)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.305), to the effect that in
the case of miscarriage of justice, every one of those persons should be
punished;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 15);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II,
p. 200);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, p. 5a).
