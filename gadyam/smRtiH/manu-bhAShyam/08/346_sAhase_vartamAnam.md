This also is a declamation.

He who condones the man addicted to violence—the causal affix in
‘*marṣayati*’ having the reflexive force, it means ‘forgives,’ ‘bears
with,’—‘*quickly falls into destruction*,’ and becomes hated among his
people; and being thus hated, he comes to be assailed and
overcome.—(346)
