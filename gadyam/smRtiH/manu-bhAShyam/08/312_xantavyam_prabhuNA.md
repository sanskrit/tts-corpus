‘*Partisans of litigants*,’—*i.e*., the relations and friends of the
plaintiff and the defendant. When one of the parties is imprisoned, his
father or mother may ‘*abuse*’— cast aspersions upon, or curse—the king;
then he should forgive them.

Also the litigants themselves, when they happen to be ‘*young or aged or
infirm*.’

In this manner his own welfare becomes accomplished. This
‘accomplishment of welfare’ is the fruit of obeying the injunction
‘shall forgive.’—(312)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 66);—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (14a), which explains ‘*kṣipatām*’ as ‘shouting.’

**(verses 8.312-313)  
**

*Nārada* (Theft, 39-40).—‘Neither for the purpose of gaining a friend,
nor for the acquisition of wealth, should a wicked criminal be suffered
by the King to go free. By pardoning an offender, a king commits the
same offence as by punishing an innocent man. Religious merit accrues to
him from punishing the wicked.’

*Bṛhaspati* (22-33).—‘By punishment of the wicked and release of the
virtuous, the renown and religious merit of the King is increased.’

*Gautama* (12-52).—‘Or pardon may be granted in accordance with an
assemblage of persons learned in the Vedas.’
