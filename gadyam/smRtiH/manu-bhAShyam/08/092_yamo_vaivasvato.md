With a view to strike terror in the heart of the man, it is next
described who is the ‘*silent watcher*’ (mentioned in the preceding
verse).

You have heard of the God, who is the destroyer of the body and property
and other things belonging to all living beings, and who punishes them
with torments; that God resides in your heart, and not away from you; in
the event of committing a wrong, he will punish you immediately;—and do
not think that being your own sold, ho will ignore your fault; because
no one is his ‘own.’

‘*If you have no quarrel with him*’—if he is satisfied with you and
trusts you, then what would be the need for your going to bathe in the
Gaṅgā for the cleansing of your sins? What too would be the need for
going to *Kurukṣetra*? For the reward of going to these places consists
in the destruction of sins and acquiring of merit; and all this is
obtained by the man here and now, if he is at pence with the Supreme
Self (within him). As a matter of fact, the soul of a sinner is never
free from fear; the unbeliever also has doubts regarding what is going
to happen to him at death.

The *Gaṅgā* is a river that purifies: and in ‘*Kurukṣetra*’ it is the
land itself that purities.—(92)
