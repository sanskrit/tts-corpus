Verily he shall not kill the Brāhmaṇa, even though he be steeped in all crimes; he should banish him from the kingdom, with all his property and unhurt.—(380).

‘*In all crimes*.’—What is said here should not, on the strength of
context, be taken as applying to ‘adultery’ only; it pertains to other
crimes also.

‘*Even*’—This term means that even though the Brāhmaṇa may have
committed all the crimes simultaneously, he should never be made to
suffer the death-penalty.

“What then should be done to the criminal?”

The king shall ‘*banish him*’—send him away—‘*from the kingdom*’—out of
his realm;—‘*with all his property*’—along with all his
belongings;—‘*unhurt*’—in body.

“If the property even is not to be confiscated, what would be the
punishment to the Brāhmaṇa?”

Some people say that when the text distinctly says that the man is to be
banished ‘with his property,’ it is clear that it forbids the imposition
of fine. Others however explain the words ‘banished with his property’
to mean that he shall be banished after all his property has been
confiscated.—(380)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 681), to the effect that even
though actual death has been prohibited as a penalty for the Brāhmaṇa,
yet there are other penalties which are equal to, and substitutes for,
that penalty;—again on p. 842, where it notes that the banishment here
laid down is meant for cases other than the ‘mortal offences.’

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 682);—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.81), which
remarks that corporeal punishment is never to be inflicted on the
Brāhmaṇa; this is the general law laid down here; and again on 3.267;—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 115);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*. (p. 183),
to the effect that for the Brāhmaṇa there is no death-penalty.
