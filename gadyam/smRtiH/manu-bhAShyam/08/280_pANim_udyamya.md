<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

If he raises his hand for the purpose of striking, then the hand should
be cut off,—even though he may not actually strike.

‘*Stick*’ stands for anything that hurts in the same manner as the stick
does. Hence if he strikes with the soft root of the lily and such
things, the punishment shall be less severe.

‘*If he strikes with the foot*’;—here also *raising* is to be
understood.

‘Threatening’ also is included herein.—(280)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p, 268) in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 288), which adds that, though in the case of other castes
raising a weapon to strike one of a higher caste, the penalty is to be
the ‘first amercement,’ yet for the Śūdra it has to be the cutting of
the hand and other limbs.

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 814);—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.215), to the
effect that in the case of the Śūdra for merely raising a weapon, the
hand is to be cut off;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 75);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 146b).
