When however, they are grazing together in the forest, duly protected,—if a wolf pounces upon one and kills it,—the keeper is not to blame.—(236)

In the preceding verse the dual number in ‘*ajāvike*’ (‘goats and
sheep’) is based upon the fact that *two* kinds of animals are meant;
though in reality, being a copulative compound of the names of
‘animals,’ it should have taken the singular ending. In the present
verse we have the feminine plural, in consideration of the individual
animals concerned.

‘*Duty protected*,’ ‘*together*’;—kept together, flocked in one place;
having their movements hitherto duly checked;—while grazing in the
forest, before the eyes of the keeper;—if a wolf should suddenly emerge
out of a thicket and pounce upon and kill one of them;—in this case the
keeper is not to be blamed. Because it is absolutely impossible for a
man to shut out every little opening in the forest, consisting as it
does of endless trees and thickets and creepers; and wolves are always
on the lookout for such openings.

The addition of the term ‘*together*’ shows that if they are allowed to
roam about long distances, then if any is killed, the blame does lie
with the keeper. The animals are in the hands of the keeper; so that if
they come to harm through his carelessness, it should be made good by
the keeper himself. It is for the purpose of making this simple fact
easily understood that the author has had recourse to these detailed
assertions.—(236)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 175), which explains
‘*mithaḥ*’ as ‘herded together’,—‘*tatra*’ *i.e*., on the death of the
cow;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 265), which explains
‘*avaruddhānām*’ as ‘herded together by the keeper’ and in *Aparārka*
(p. 773).

236	But if they, kept in (proper) order, graze together in the forest, and a wolf, suddenly jumping on one of them, kills it, the herdsman shall bear in that case no responsibility.
