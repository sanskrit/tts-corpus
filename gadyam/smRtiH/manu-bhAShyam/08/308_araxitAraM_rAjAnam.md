He who affords no protection and devours the people, grabbing his tribute of the sixth part of the produce,—him they declare to be the imbiber of the filth of the whole people.—(308)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse is a deprecatory supplement to what has gone before.

‘*Affords no protection*,’ and ‘*devours*’—*i.e*., lives upon the
people, by taking the royal dues. this same idea is stated more
clearly—‘*grabbing his tribute.'*

Such a king, all cultured men declare to be the ‘*imbiber of*’—who draws
upon himself—‘*fifth*’— sin—‘*of the whole people*’—of all his subjects.
That is, such a king is befouled by the sins of his people.—(308)
