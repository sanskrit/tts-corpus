‘*Having caught him*,’ *i.e*., detected and put him under restraint—tho
king should punish him, without giving him any time.

*The* ‘*niṣka of four suvarṇas each*’—is that which is made up of four
‘*suvarṇas*.’

Though under 8.317, the ‘*niṣka*’ has been defined as a measure
consisting of four ‘suvarṇas,’ yet the qualification is added here in
view of other definitions of the ‘*niṣka*’ found in other Smṛtis—*e.g*.,
one of them describes it as consisting of ‘a hundred *suvarṇas*.’

It might be argued that, in as much as the author himself has applied
the name ‘*niṣka*’ to four ‘*suvarṇas*’ only, the mere mention of the
name in the present text would be enough to show what is meant.

But, since the work is a metrical treatise, the presence of a
superfluous epithet cannot be regarded as a defect.

Others have taken the term ‘*catuḥsuvarṇa*’ as a Bahuvrīhi compound,
having the collective force, and hence explained the verse as
prescribing *three fines*; the meaning being that the fine is to consist
of ‘*four suvarṇas*,’ and ‘*six niṣkas*’; so that *ten niṣkas* come to
be indicated.

But for the purpose of making the compound a *Bahuvrīhi*, it would be
necessary to fasten the sense of *possession* on to that of
*association*. For mere *association* with ‘variegated cows’ does not
make Devadatta a ‘*Citraguḥ*’ (which is a Bahuvrīhi compound meaning
*possessing variegated cows*).

If the fines are to be taken as *three* distinct ones, then the only
construction possible is to take the three as constituting a single
penalty.

The penalty hero prescribed is alternative to ‘banishment’ (prescribed
in the preceding verse).—(220)

“According to ‘others’ mentioned by Medhātithi, ‘four *Suvarṇas*, *or
six Niṣkas*, *or one Śatamāna*; Kullūka and Rāghavānanda also think it
possible that three separate fines may be inflicted according to the
circumstances of the case.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 182), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Nigṛhya*,’ having him hauled up;—‘*catuḥsuvarṇān*’
qualifying ‘*ṣaṭ niṣkān*’ means ‘six of those *Niṣkas* which consists of
4 *Suvarṇas* each the epithet ‘*catuḥsuvarṇān*’ being added for the
exclusion of the other two measures of the ‘*Niṣkas*’ that are found in
the Śāstras—*viz*. (*a*) ‘the *Niṣka* consists of 108 *Suvarṇas*,’ (*b*)
‘the *Niṣka* consists of 5 *Suvarṇas*.’—‘*Śatamāna*’ consists of 320
*Raktikās*.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.187), which notes that herein Manu
mentions *four* penalties—(1) Banishment (verse 219), (2) fine of four
*Suvarṇas*, (3) fine of 6 *Niṣkas* and (4) fine of one *Śatamāna*; and
any *one* of these may be inflicted in accordance with the peculiar
circumstances of each case, such as the caste, the capacity and other
things of the persons concerned.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 253), which also
regards the four as distinct penalties, to be determined according to
the caste, learning and other qualifications of the persons
concerned;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (107a), which says that ‘*Śatamāna*’ is
equal to 320 *Rattis*;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 132a).
