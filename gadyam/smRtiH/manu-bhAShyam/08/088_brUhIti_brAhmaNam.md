He shall question the Brāhmaṇa with the word ‘speak,’ the Kṣatriya with ‘speak out the truth,’ the Vaiśya by sins pertaining to kine, grain and food, and the Śūdra by all the sins.—(88)

[^३०९]:
     All editions read "sarvais," but it is clear that Medhātithi's reading was "ebhis", as is evident from his commentary: "vakṣyamāṇaiḥ pātakaiḥ", and the reading "śūdram ebhis tu pātakaiḥ" given at 8.99.

“On what basis do we have the instrumental ending in *gobījakāñcanaiḥ*?
If it be said to be due to these being *instruments* in the act of
*questioning*, that cannot be; as it is the word (and not the kine,
etc.) that are the *instruments*, a means of questioning.”

There is no force in this objection. We have to construe the words in
such a manner as to make the ‘kine,’ etc., instruments of the
questioning. The word ‘*pātakaiḥ*,’ ‘*sins*’ has got to be construed
both ways, so that we have the phrase ‘*gobījakāñcunaiḥ pātakaiḥ*,’
which gives the meaning that ‘he should ask them by mentioning sins
pertaining to the kine, grains and gold,’ *i.e*., the form of the
question to be employed should he—‘if you tell a lie, you would he
incurring the same sin that follows from stealing or killing the cow.’

Similarly, by mentioning the sins going to be enumerated (in the next
verse), he should question the *Śūdra*. The term ‘*sin*’ here should he
taken as standing for *words expressing sins*; because the sins
themselves could not be the *means or instrument* of the *questioning*,
as pointed out above.—(88)

‘*Gobījakañcanaiḥ*’—‘Threatening him with the guilt of all offences
committed against kine and the rest’ (Medhātithi) ‘with the guilt of the
theft of kine etc.’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘with the
loss of his kine etc.’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘by making him touch the cow and
other things’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 674);—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 78), where however the first half is read as “sasyena
śāpayedvi??aṃ kṣanniyaṃ vāhanāyudhaiḥ”;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 215),
which adds:—The Vaiśya is to be admonished with the words:—‘those sins
would accrue to you which are involved in stealing the cow etc. if you
tell a lie and the Śūdra with the words—‘all kinds of sins would fall on
you etc. etc.’;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 204);—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (33b).

*Viṣṇu* (8.20-23).—‘The Brāhmaṇa witness, the Judge shall exhort to
*declare*,—the Kṣatriya, to *declare the truth*:—the Vaiśya he shall
address thus:—‘*Thy kine and gold shall yield thee no fruit*”;—the Śūdra
he should address thus:—“*Thou shalt have to atone for all heavy
crimes*.”’

*Nārada* (1.198).—‘He shall cause the Brāhmaṇa to swear by truth, the
Kṣatriya by his conveyances and weapons, the Vaiśya by his cows, grain
or gold; and the Śūdra by all sorts of crimes.’
