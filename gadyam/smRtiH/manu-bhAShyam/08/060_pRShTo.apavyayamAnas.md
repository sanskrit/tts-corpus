Being ‘*summoned*’— called, complained against, and let off on
security,—‘*and questioned*’— in the presence of the King, either by the
judge or by other members of the Court—‘Do you, or do you not, owe this
amount to this person?’—if the man denies it; ‘*then he shall he c*
*onv* *icted*,’—proved to be wrong—‘*by* *the man seeking for his
due*’—*i.e*., by the person who is desirous of proving that the sum had
been really lent by him,—‘by *means of at least three witnesses*’;—the
compound ‘*tryavara*’ means ‘*of whom three is the least number*,’ the
term ‘*avara*’ standing for the minimum; the meaning being that if they
are to be fewest, they should he *three*; otherwise they should he more
than three;—*in the presence of the King and the Brāhmaṇas*.’

An objection is raised:—“The witnesses are naturally to be questioned
before the persons by whom the case has begun to be tried; why then
should it ho asserted that this has to be done *in the* *presence* *of
the King and the Brāhmaṇas*?”

There is no force in this. It is just possible that the witnesses might
be questioned by deputing a trustworthy person to go to them; hence with
a view to emphasise that the witnesses should be questioned personally
by the trying persons, it has been reiterated here.—(60)

*Nārada* (2.26).—‘When the defendant denies the claim, the plaintiff has
to prove his claim, unless the denial should have been in the form of a
*special plea*. What the plaintiff has fully stated in the plaint, that
he must substantiate by adducing evidence at the third stage of the
trial.’

*Nārada* (1.147 (?)).—‘In doubtful cases, when two parties are
quarrelling with one another, the truth has to be gathered from
witnesses, whose knowledge is based on what has been seen, heard or
understood by them.’

*Bṛhaspati* (5.1-3).—‘When litigants are quarrelling in a court of
justice, the Judges, after examining the answer, shall adjudge the
burden of proof to either of the two parties. The Judges............
having determined to which party the burden of proof shall be adjudged,
that person shall substantiate the whole of his declaration by documents
or other proofs. The plaintiff shall prove his declaration, and the
defendant his special plea.’

*Āpastamba* (2.29.7).—‘The witness shall answer the questions put to
him, according to the truth, in the morning, before a kindled fire,
standing near water, in the presence of the King, with the consent of
all, after having been exhorted by the Judges to be fair to both sides.’

*Gautama* (13.1).—‘In disputed cases the truth shall be established by
means of witnesses.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.69). ‘Witnesses should be at least three.’
