<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

If two months have elapsed since the last monthly course, it is a sign
that the woman is pregnant, such a woman deserves kindly treatment;
hence no ferry-toll is to be realised from her.

‘*Ascetic*’—belonging to the fourth order.

‘*Hermit*’—living in the forest and performing austerities.

*Brāhmaṇas in holy orders*’— the term ‘*brāhmaṇa*’ has been added as a
qualification; hence the rule does not apply to those who only bear the
garb of asceticism.

‘*Toll*’—fare for crossing, in the form of a ‘*paṇa*’ and so forth.

This they shall not be made to pay.

Having mentioned ‘toll’ already, the author has added the term ‘*at a
ferry-crossing*’ only in consideration of metrical exigencies.—(407)

*Nārada* (18.38).—‘The Brāhmaṇa has the right to cross rivers without
paying toll, and to be conveyed to the other side before others. When
engaged in trading, if he uses a ferry boat, he shall have to pay no
toll.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.132-133).—‘A ferry-man, or a toll-official, who takes a fare
or toll from a student or an ascetic or a renunciate, or a pregnant
woman, or one going on pilgrimage,—shall he fined 10 Paṇas,—and he shall
restore the toll to them.’
