The sacrificial fees are paid at the ‘Mid-day Extraction’; if a priest
gives up his work after that, the fee paid to him shall not be refunded;
he ‘*should receive it*’—*i.e*., he should not be made to refund it.

The work should be completed by the sacrificer, through another person,
paying him an additional fee. This has been added with a view to
preclude the following notion—“Everything in connection with sacrifices
should be done by *priests*,—persons become *priests* when they have
been appointed as such,—this appointment can be made only at the
prescribed time, which is before the commencement of the performance, so
that if an appointment were to be made during the performance, it would
become defective,—and yet the performance has got to be finished,—and if
it has to be finished in a defective form, I shall get only those
details performed which can be done by the priests other than the one
who has gone away.” The sense is that only that much of deficiency has
to be admitted as cannot be avoided; and every little detail that can he
done should be done.

Some people have held that the verb ‘should be got done’ is to be
construed with the ‘priest’; the meaning being that the sacrificer shall
pay to the remaining priests higher fees and get the abandoned work done
by them, if he cannot do it himself; but, as before the payment of the
final fee, the burden of finishing the performance rests with the
sacrificer.—(207)

‘*Kārayet*’—‘The sacrificer should have it done by another priest’
(Medhātithi);—‘the defaulting priest should have it done by another
(Nārāyaṇa, Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 837);—in *Paraśāramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 222), which explains ‘*anyena*’ as ‘by some from among
that group of priests to which he himself belongs’;—in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 118);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 49), which says—‘if the priest leaves
his work after, having received the fee after the midday rites, then he
is to return the entire fee, and get the work completed by his son or
others’;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (89b).

*Yājñavalkya* (2.265).—(See under 206.)

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 120).—‘After a Priest has been
appointed, if the sacrificer appoint another, the fee shall be paid to
the former; if he happen to go out for some time, then his return shall
be awaited, and the sacrificer shall not go on with the performance
during his absence. If the completion of the performance becomes urgent,
he may have it completed; and on his return, the priest may be given
some fee.’

*Nārada* (3.8-11).—‘When an officiating priest has met with an accident,
another priest shall officiate for him, and receive from him his part of
the fee. Where an officiating priest forsakes a sacrificer, who is no
offender and is free from guilt,—or when a sacrificer forsakes a
faultless priest,—they shall both be punished. There are three sorts of
officiating priests: hereditary, appointed by the sacrificer himself,
and one who performs the priestly functions of his own accord, through
friendship; the above law applies to the hereditary and appointed
priests; no sin attaches to the forsaking of the priest acting of his
own accord.’
