When the Teacher (Manu) was asked (in the beginning of this work) to
explain Duties, he proceeded to describe the origination of the world
and other cognate matters; hence when the pupil (Bhṛgu) has been
directed to expound the Law, he also begins with the remaining parts of
the same process of world-creation.

‘*Of this*’—the pronoun refers to the Manu before their eyes;—our
teacher, who is known as ‘*Svāyambhuva*.’ There are *six other Manus who
belong to the same race* as himself,—persons horn in the same family are
said to ‘belong to the same race,’ and since all Manus are called into
being directly by Brahmā himself, they are born in the same family, and
are hence said to ‘belong to the same race.’ Or, persons engaged in the
same work are also said ‘to belong to the same race’; as a matter of
fact, living beings are often distributed among ‘races’ in accordance
with the work done by them; *e.g*., we have such statements as—‘related
to grammar there are two sages who belong to the same race.’

The text proceeds to point out one such work common to the Manus:—“*They
have called into being each his own offsprings*”; in each *Manvantara*,
created beings destroyed during the previous *Manvantara* are again
created and protected by that particular Manu who holds sway over that
*Manvantara*; hence the offsprings that each of them creates are called
‘his own.’—(61)
