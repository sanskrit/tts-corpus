The very genesis of the Brāhmaṇa is the eternal incarnation of Virtue; for he is born for the sake of Virtue; and this (birth) leads to the state of Brahman. (98).

The peculiarity of the Brāhmaṇa endowed with the qualities of learning
and the like having been described, some people might be led to
ill-treat the mere Brāhmaṇa by birth; hence with a view to prevent this,
the author has added this verse.

‘*The very genesis*’—*i.e*., irrespective of his qualities, his mere
birth, the mere ‘Brāhmaṇa caste’—‘*is the eternal* *incar*
*nation*’—body—‘*of Virtue*.’

‘*Born for the sake of virtue*,’—when the Brāhmaṇa has been duly
initiated with the rites of initiation, this is what constitutes his
‘*being horn for the sake of Virtue*’; and ‘*this* *birth leads to the
state of Brahman*’; on abandoning the ‘body of Virtue’, the Brāhmaṇa
becomes the partaker of Supreme Bliss.—says the *Śruti*. (98).

‘*Brahma*’—stands here for the Highest Spiritual Being; and not for the
*Veda*, as Burnell understands it to mean, even after entertaining
doubts on the matter. All the commentators agree in explaining the
phrase ‘*brahmabhūyāya kalpate*’ as ‘becomes fit for being liberated—by
being absorbed into Brahman, the Supreme Self.’

098	The very birth of a Brahmana is an eternal incarnation of the sacred law; for he is born to (fulfil) the sacred law, and becomes one with Brahman.
