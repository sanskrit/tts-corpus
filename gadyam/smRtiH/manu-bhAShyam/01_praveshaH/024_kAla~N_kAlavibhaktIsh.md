The author mentions Time, because it belongs to the same category (of
‘action’) as Duty. It is only according to Vaiśesikas that Time is a
*substance*; according to others it is a form of *action*; it consists
in the extension of the motions of the Sun and other planets, and is
liable to return.

‘*Divisious of Time*’—such divisions as into ‘month,’ ‘season,’
‘half-year,’ ‘year’ and so forth.

‘*Lunar Mansions*’—such as *Kṛttikā* (Pleiades), *Rohiṇī* (Aldebaran)
and the rest.

‘*Planets*’—Sun and the rest.

‘*Rivers*’—streams.

‘*Oceans*’—seas—and ‘Mountains.’

‘*Even tracts of land*’—such tracts of land as are of one uniform form,
devoid of ditches and holes.—‘*Rugged tracts of land*’—such as are high
and low.—(24)

*Medhātithi* (p. 19, 1. 21)—It is interesting to note that even so late
as Medhātithi’s time, the Lunar Mansions were counted from *Kṛttikā*
onwards, and not from *Aśvinī* as in the more recent astronomical
systems. (See Thibaut on ‘Indian Astronomy’ in *Indian Thought Vol. I*.)

This verse is quoted in the *Gadādharapaddhati* — *Kālasāra*, p. 5, as
describing the creation of time and its divisions;—also in the
*Kālamādhava* (p. 45) as describing the creation of time by God; it
reads ‘*vibhaktim*’ for ‘*vibhaktiḥ*.’
