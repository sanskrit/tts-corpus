‘*Of all Austerity*,—*i.e*. Breath-control, silence, observances,
self-control, and the busts of ‘*Kṛcchra*, *Chāndrā* *yaṇa*, and also
absolute Fasting’;—of all this ‘Austerity,’ Right Behaviour is ‘*the
root*,’—the direct cause, leading to the growth of their fruit.—For the
reason given, the *sages regarded*, accepted, it as being the
*root*,—*i.e*. the cause,—of Austerity, performed by men desiring
results.—‘*Having seen that virtue is got at*,’—acquired—‘*from Right
Behaviour*.’—However difficult the Austerity performed, it is not
fruitful for the man that is without Right Behaviour so says the
*Śruti*.—(111).
