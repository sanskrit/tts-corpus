The author now begins to describe the measures of time, which are taught
in the Science of Astronomy, for the purpose of determining the exact
duration of time of the continuance of the world and its dissolution.

Eighteen ‘*nimeṣas*’ go to make that measure of time which is known as
‘*Kāṣṭhā*’;—thirty ‘*Kāṣṭhās*’ make one ‘*Kalā*’;—thirty ‘*Kalās*’ make
one ‘*Muhūrta*,’ and ‘*as many*’—*i.e*., thirty;—thirty ‘*muhurtas*’
make one ‘*Ahorātra*’ (Day and Night).

‘*Should be known as*’—this verb has got to be supplied.

‘*Tāvataḥ*,’ ‘a s many,’ is the Accusative Plural form.

“What is it that is called *Nimeṣa*?”

‘*Nimeṣa* is the natural *winking* of the Eye-lashes, which accompanies
every opening of the eye. Other people have declared that ‘*Nimeṣa*’ is
that time which is taken in the distinct utterance of one
letter-sound.—(64)

‘*Nimeṣa*’—(1) The time taken by one wink of the eye, or (2) the time
taken in the distinct pronouncing of one syllable.

‘*Tāvaṭaḥ*’—in the Accusative necessitates the supplying of the
Transitive verb ‘*vidyāṭ*,’ ‘one should know’. Nārāyaṇa and Nandana
however favour the nominative form ‘*ṭāvanṭaḥ*’ which obviates the
necessity of adding any words.

*Cf*. in this connection Wilson’s Viṣṇu-Purāṇa—Ed. Hall, Vol. I, pp.
47-50.

‘In the world of human beings it is the Sun that divides the Day and
Night, the night is for the sleep of creatures and the day for active
operations;—the Month constitutes the Day-Night of the Pitṛs, the
brighter half being the Day, for active operations and the darker half,
the Night, for sleeping. The year constitutes the Day-Night of the gods,
the northern solstice, the Night.... 4,000 years constitute the
*Kṛtayuga* and each succeeding *yuga* \[*Tretāyuga*, *Dvāparayuga*,
*Kaliyuga*\] is a quarter less, etc., etc.’
