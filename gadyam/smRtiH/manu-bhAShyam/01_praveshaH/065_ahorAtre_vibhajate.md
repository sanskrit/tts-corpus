The Sun divides the ‘Day’ and ‘Night’ of Men and Gods; [of others] what is conducive to the repose of beings is ‘Night,’ and what is conducive to activity is ‘Day.’—(65)

अहश् च रात्रिश् च **अहोरात्रे** । तयोर् विभागं करोति आदित्यः । उदित आदित्ये यावत् तदीया रश्मयो दृश्यन्ते तावद् अहर्व्यवहारः । अस्तम् इते तु प्राग् उदयाद् रात्रिव्यवहारः । मनुष्यलोके देवलोके वा । यत्र तर्ह्य् आदित्यो न व्याप्नोति रश्मिभिस् तत्र कथम् अयम् अहोरात्रविभागो विज्ञेयो ऽत आह । **रात्रिः स्वप्नायेति** । स्वयंप्रभेषु भूतेषु नित्यप्रकाशित्वात् कर्मचेष्टाकार्यारम्भेण स्वापेन च विभागः । यथैवौषधीनां नियतः प्रादुर्भावकालः स्वाभाव्याद् एवं कर्मचेष्टास्वापाव् अपि कालस्वभावत एव नियतौ ॥ १.६५ ॥

‘*Ahorātra*’— ‘day’ and ‘night’; of these the Sun makes the division;
the Sun having risen, so long as his rays are visible, it is called
‘day’; and from the time that the Sun sets to the time that he rises
again, it is called ‘night.’ Such is the case in the region of men and
in the region of Gods.

“In a place where the Sun does not reach with his rays,—how is one to
make this division of ‘day’ and ‘night’?”

The answer to this is given in the second line—‘*what is conducive* &c.’
For such beings as are self-illumined, as the light is always there (and
it never ceases) the division of ‘day’ and ‘night’ is made according to
the *undertaking of actions* and *going to sleep*. Just as in the case
of herbs, the time for sprouting is fixed by nature, exactly in the same
manner, in the case of the beings in question, the times of ‘activity’
and ‘repose’ are fixed by the nature, of time itself \[and are not
variable\].—(65)

‘*Rātriḥ svapnāya* &c.’—This line supplies the definition of ‘Day’ and
‘Night’ for those regions that are beyond the reach of the Sun;—‘Day’
being the *period of activity*, and ‘Night’ the *period of repose*.
