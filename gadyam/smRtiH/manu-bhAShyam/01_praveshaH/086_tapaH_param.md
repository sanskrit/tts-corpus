In the Kṛta Cycle, ‘Austerity’ is the highest; in the Tretā ‘knowledge’ is described as such; in the Dvāpara they call the ‘Sacrifice’ the highest, and ‘Charity’ alone in the Kali-Cycle—(86).

अयम् अन्यो युगस्वभावभेदः कथ्यते । तपःप्रभृतीनां वेदे युगभेदेन विधानाभावात् सर्वदा सर्वाण्य् अनुष्ठेयानि । अयं त्व् अनुवादो यथा कथंचिद् व्याख्येयः[^१३९] । इतिहासेषु ह्य् एवं वर्ण्यते । **तपः **प्रधानं तच् च महाफलम् । दीर्घायुषो रोगवर्जितास् तपसि समर्था भवन्ति । अनेनाभिप्रायेणोच्यते । **ज्ञानम्** अध्यात्मविषयम् । शरीरक्लेशाद् अन्तर्नियमो नातिदुष्करः । यागे तु न महाक्लेश इति **द्वापरे यज्ञः** प्रधानम् । दाने तु न शरीरक्लेशः, नान्तःसंयमः, न चातीव विद्वतोपयुज्यत इति सुसंपादता[^१४०] ॥ १.८६ ॥

Another difference in the character of the Cycles is now described.

As a matter of fact, Austerity and the other Virtues are not prescribed
in the Veda with reference to any particular Cycle, all of them should
be performed at all times; hence the description contained in the
present verse has got to be explained somehow or other. In fact it is in
the Itihāsas that the distinction herein set forth is met with. \[When
‘Austerity’ is relegated to the *Kṛta* Cycle\] what is meant is that it
is the principal—and hence the most effective—Virtue cultivated; and the
men being longlived and free from disease are most capable of performing
Austerities.

‘*Knowledge*’—i.e. of spiritual matters. Though the men \[being not
quite so healthy in the *Tretā* as in the *Kṛta* \], suffer in the body,
yet this bodily suffering does not render the internal discipline
(necessary for spiritual knowledge) very difficult.

In as much as there is not much trouble in the performance of
*Sacrifices*, sacrifice forms the chief virtue in *Dvāpara*.

In *Charity*, there is neither physical suffering, nor need for internal
discipline or much learning; hence it is easily done.—(86)

This verse is quoted in Hemādri—Pariśeṣa—Kāla, p. 657, where ‘*Tapas*’
is explained as ‘Kṛcchra, Cāndrāyaṇa etc.,’ and ‘*jñāna*’ as ‘*dhyāna*’
‘meditation’;—in the Vīramitrodaya—Paribhāṣā, p. 48;—in the
*Smṛticandrikā*—Samskāra, p. 27, which explains ‘*par* *am*’ as ‘the
most important;’—and in the *Kṛtyasārsamuccaya*, p. 80.

086	In the Krita age the chief (virtue) is declared to be (the performance of) austerities, in the Treta (divine) knowledge, in the Dvapara (the performance of) sacrifices, in the Kali liberality alone.
