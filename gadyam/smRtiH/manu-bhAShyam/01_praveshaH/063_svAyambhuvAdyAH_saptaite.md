Here *seven Manus* have been mentioned by me; elsewhere they are spoken
of as *fourteen*.

‘*Each* *during his own regime*’—during his time, *i.e*., during the
time of his sovereignty.—‘*Having called into being*’ the offerings,
they ‘*maintained*,’ nourished, them.—‘*During his own regime*’—means
during the time of his sovereignty; *i.e*., that Manu whose time or turn
it was to create and maintain the continuity of the world.

Others explain the term ‘*antara*’ as denoting a particular time-period,
just like the words ‘month’ &c.

But this is not right; it is only when the term ‘*antara*’ occurs along
with the term ‘Manu’ (*i.e*., in the compound ‘*Manvantara*’) that it
becomes expressive of a time-period,—*i.e*., the time-period known ns
‘*Manvantara*,’—and not when it stands by itself (as it does in the
text).
