What the Brāhmana eats is his own; his own what he wears and his own also what he gives; it ts due to the good will of the Brāhmaṇa that other people enjoy (things). (101).

What the Brāhmaṇa eats as a guest in the house of others is really his
own; it should not be thought that he is receiving food from another
person’s kitchen.—Similarly ‘*what he wears is his own*’;—*i.e*., when
he obtains clothing, either by begging or otherwise, it does not mean
that he has acquired it from others; what it means is that he is
employing what is *his own* in the covering of his body.—What he obtains
for his own use, in that he may lie exercising his own right of
possession; hut when he gives away to people what belongs to others,
this also is nothing wrong for him; it is only his *good will*,
benevolence. It is by reason of the large-heartedness of the Brāhmaṇa
that Kings on earth enjoy their possessions; otherwise, if the Brāhmaṇa
were to wish—‘I should take all this and apply it to my own use,’—then
all others would become penniless, having nothing that they could use
for their own benefit.—(101)

101	The Brahmana eats but his own food, wears but his own apparel, bestows but his own in alms; other mortals subsist through the benevolence of the Brahmana.
