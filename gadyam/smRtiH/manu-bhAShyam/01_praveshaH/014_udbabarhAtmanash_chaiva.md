explained by implication.

‘*From out of himself*’—*i.e*., from out of Primordial Matter, which
forms his body, ‘*he brought forth Mind*.’ The creation of the Elemental
Principles is set forth here in the reverse order; the meaning thus is
that ‘*before the mind he brought up the Principle of Egoism, whose
function consists in self-consciousness*’; the consciousness of self,
appearing in the form of the notion of ‘I,’ is a function of the
Principle of Egoism; it is called *all-powerful* in the sense that it is
capable of accomplishing its work.—(14)
