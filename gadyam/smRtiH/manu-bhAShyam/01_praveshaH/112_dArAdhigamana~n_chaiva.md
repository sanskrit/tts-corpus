‘*Taking of wife*,’—the accepting of a wife in marriage;—‘*the
definition*’—*i.e*., the means of distinguishing the exact
character—‘*of marriages*,’—such as the ‘*Brahma*’ and the rest, which
form the means by which the wife is taken.—‘*The great sacrifices*’—the
five offerings of the ‘Vaiśvadeva’ and the rest.—‘*The regulations*,’
rules, method, *relating to śrāddhas, ‘offering to the Pitṛs*.’

The terms ‘*para*,’ ‘*excellent*’ (in verse 111), and ‘*eternal*’ (in
112) only serve to fill in the metre.

All this forms the subject-matter of discourse III.—(112)
