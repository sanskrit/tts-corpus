Water is called ‘nara,’—water being the offspring of nara; since water was the first thing created by (or, the original residence of) that being, he is, on that account, described as ‘nārāyaṇa.’—(10)

The Being just described is the same who, here and there in the
scriptures, is described under the name ‘*Nārāyaṇa*,’ as possessed of a
superior degree of creative and cognitive powers, and hence being the
Personal Creator of the world; the mere difference in names does not
necessarily imply difference in the things denoted; so that the Beings
described under the names ‘*Brahmā*,’ ‘*Nārāyana*’ and ‘*Maheśvara* are
one and the same; though they form the objects of diverse forms of
worship, yet they do not differ among themselves; as we shall show under
Discourse XII.

How this is (*i.e*. how *Brahmā* is the same as ‘*Nārāyana*’) is
explained now:—‘*Water is called Nara*.’—described under the name
of,—‘*Nara*.’

In answer to the objection—“There is no such usage current among
experienced persons; nor is it generally known that water is called
*Nara*,”—the Author adds:—‘*Water being the offspring of Nara*,’—the
supreme Being (Hiraṇyagarbha, described in verse 8 as having created
water) might well be known under the name ‘*Nara*,’ *Person*; and water
is his ‘*offspring*;’ hence water is spoken of as ‘Nara,’ the name of
the father is often applied to the child, *e.g*., the ‘sons of
Vaśiṣṭha,’ the revered sages *Tāvabhru, Maṇḍu and Lomaka*, are spoken of
as ‘*Vaśiṣṭhāḥ*’; and such usage is based upon the

figurative identification of the child with the father.—‘*Since*’
because—‘*Water*,’ known as ‘*Nara*,’ was ‘*the first thing created
by*’—or it was his *container* when he lay in the womb (egg)—‘*he is, on
that account, described as Nārāyaṇa*.’

In the sense of ‘*he whose container is* *Nara*’the compound should be
‘*narāyaṇa*;’ but the first vowel may be taken as lengthened according
to Pāṇini’s Sūtra 6.3.134, which justifies such lengthening in several
other cases also,; just as we have in the word ‘*pūruṣa*’ (which is a
variant for ‘*puruṣa*’);—or we may have the lengthening due to the affix
‘*aṇ*’ in the sense of ‘mass’ \[so that *nāra* would be ‘mass of water,’
and ‘he who has this mass of water as his *container*, *ayana*,’ would
he ‘*nārāyaṇa*’\]. (10).

*Āpo nārā* &c.—This explanation of the name ‘Nārayaṇa’ is found in
[Viṣṇu Puraṇa
I](/hinduism/book/the-viśnu-purana-2/d/doc115935.html "English translation by Horace Hayman Wilson"),
and also in the [Mahābhārata,
3.189.3](/hinduism/book/the-mahabharata-third-book/d/doc7469.html "English translation by Kriśna-Dwaipayana Vyasa").

It is curious that Medhātithi reads ‘*narāḥ*’ (instead of ‘*nārāḥ*’) and
adds a somewhat forced explanation of the elongation of the initial
vowel in ‘nā’.

*Medhātithi* P. 12, l. 6—*Babhrumaṇḍuloniakāḥ*—These apparently are
three other proper names—‘Babhru’, ‘Maṇḍu’ and ‘Lomaka’,—which stand on
the same footing as ‘Vaśiṣṭha.’

*Mahābhārata*, 12.341.40.—\[Same as Manu ; but being placed in the mouth
of Nārāyaṇa himself, the second half is put in the First
Person.\]—“*That is why I am Nārāyaṇa*.”

010	The waters are called narah, (for) the waters are, indeed, the offspring of Nara; as they were his first residence (ayana), he thence is named Narayana.
