‘*Brahmā*,’—The creator of living beings, has a region of his own; and
what is going to be described is *of* *Day* *and Night* as obtaining in
that region;—‘*as also of the Time-cycles*.’—‘*Learn*’ all this, ‘*in*
*brief*,’ summarily; *i.e*., hear it from me.—‘*one by one*’—that is, of
each time-cycle separately.

The present verse serves as the summary of what is going to be
described, intended to draw the attention of the audience; it is with
this view that they are exhorted to ‘*learn*.’—The ‘division of time’
having been already mentioned as the subject-matter of the context, the
reiterated promise (implied in the exhortation to ‘learn’) is meant to
indicate that a fresh subject is going to be introduced; the idea being
that what is going to be described now is not merely what remains of the
afore-mentioned ‘division of time,’ but it is also conducive to *merit*;
as will be directly stated in verse 73, where it is stated that
‘Brahma’s day is known to be sacred’; which means that the knowledge of
it brings merit.—(68)
