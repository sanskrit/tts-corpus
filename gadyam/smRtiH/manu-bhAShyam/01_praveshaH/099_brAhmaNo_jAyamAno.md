सर्वलोकस्योपरि भवति । श्रैष्ठ्यम् उपरिभावेनाह । **ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानाम्** इति प्रभुत्वम् । धर्माख्यस्य **कोशस्य गुप्तये** जायते । द्रव्यसंचयः **कोशः** । उपमानाद् धर्मसंचय उच्यते **कोश** इति ॥ १.९९ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The Brāhmaṇa comes to the top of the entire world; this ‘coming to the
top’ indicates his supremacy.

‘*He is the Supreme Lord of all beings*’,— and this supremacy comes
about for the ‘*purpose* *of guarding the treasure of
Virtue*.’—‘*Treasure*’ means a collection of objects; hence through
similarity, the collection of Virtues is called ‘treasure’ (99).
