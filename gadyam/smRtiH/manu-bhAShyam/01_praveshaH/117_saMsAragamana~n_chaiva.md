**संसारगमनं** । धर्मेण धर्मी लक्ष्यते । संसारी पुरुष आत्मा, तस्य गमनं देहाद् देहान्तरप्राप्तिः । अथ वा संसारविषयाः पृथिव्यादयो लोका उच्यन्ते । तत्र गमनं पूर्ववत् । **त्रिविधम्** उत्तमाधममध्यमं **कर्मसंभवं** शुभाशुभकर्मनिमित्तम् । **निःश्रेयसं** न केवलं कर्मनिमित्ता गतय उक्ताः । यावद् यतः परम् अन्यच् छ्रेयो नास्ति तदुपायो ऽप्य् अध्यात्मज्ञानम् उक्तम् । **कर्मणां च** विहितप्रतिषिद्धानां **गुणदोषप्रीक्षा** ॥ १.११७ ॥

‘*Saṃsāragamana*,’—the property, ‘*saṃsāra*,’ ‘*series of births and
deaths*,’ stands here for the possessor of the property, *i.e*., the
personality or *Soul*, undergoing births and deaths;—the ‘*gamana*’ of
that is its migration from one body to another.—Or, ‘**saṃsā*ra*’ may be
taken as standing for the objects of the world, *i.e*., the three
Regions of the Earth, etc.;—the ‘*gamana*’ is *being born* in those
regions, as described before.—‘*Threefold*,’ high, low and
middling.—‘*Arising from actions*’—brought about by good and bad deeds.

‘*Highest good*’—the work describes not only the conditions brought
about by deeds, but also that higher than which there is
nothing,—*i.e*., spiritual knowledge,—the means of attaining that also
has been described.

‘*Of actions*’—*i.e*.. those that are enjoined and those that are
prohibited,—‘*the examination of the good and bad features*.’—(117)
