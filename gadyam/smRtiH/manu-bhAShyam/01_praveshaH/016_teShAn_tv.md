The said six principles of their own respective evolutes,—to these he
joined their subtile components, and thus created all beings.

The number ‘*six*,’ (mentioned in connection with the Principles) is
made up of the *five* ‘Rudimentary Substances,’ to be described later
on, and the ‘Principle of Egoism’ already described.

The ‘*own envolutes*’ of these Principles, are their respective
products; *i.e*., the elemental substances, which are the products of
the‘Rudimentary Substances,’ the Sense-organs which are the products of
the ‘Principle of Egoism.’ The Eaṛth and the other Elemental Substances
being present, like so many ‘bodies,’ he joined to them the ‘subtile
components’; *i.e*., the Rudimentary Substances and the Principle of
Egoism; that is, he placed them in their proper places, and thus
‘*created all beings*,’—Gods, men, animals, birds, trees and so forth.

The meaning is as follows:—The six subtile components are productive of
one portion of the entire world, the whole of which is evolved out of
them; that they are ‘subtile’ is proved by the fact of their being
‘rudimentary’ in their character;—these he ‘*combined*,’ *i.e*., brought
together, *with their own envolutes*,’ *i.e*., their respective
products; he produced the material substances and the organs (of
action), and through these, the entire material world; these latter
being indicated by the word ‘even.’

In place of ‘*mātrāsu*’ it is better to rend ‘*mātrābhiḥ*’.—(16)

*Six elements*—The five Rudimentary Substances and the Principle of
Egoism.

Here also, and for reasons similar to the above, there is a difference
of opinion among commentators.

Nandana, and Rāghavānanda take the verse as describing the creation of
the *bodies* of things from the *body* of the Creator, and that of their
*souls* from His Soul.

The ‘six’, Rāghavānanda takes as standing for the six sense-organs, and
Nandana as for the six *tattvas*—

1.  Mahat,
2.  Ahaṅkāra,
3.  Manas,
4.  Subtile Elements,
5.  Organs, of Action
6.  and Organs of Sensation.

Medhātithi takes the verse simply as describing how the Creator created
all beings by combining ‘the subtile components of the said six
principles’ with ‘their own evolutes.’

Hopkins remarks that ‘*ātmamātrā*’ stands for ‘the *spiritual* atom as
opposed to the *elementary*,—not reflexive *elements of himself*.’

016	But, joining minute particles even of those six, which possess measureless power, with particles of himself, he created all beings.
