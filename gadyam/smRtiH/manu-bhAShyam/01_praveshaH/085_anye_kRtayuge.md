During the Kṛta-cycle, the characteristics of men are of one kind,—of different kinds during the Tretā and the dvāpara,—and of yet another kind during the Kali-cycle;—this being due to the deterioration of each suceeding Cycle.—(85)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse sums up what has been said in regard to the diversity in the
nature of things based upon the difference in time.

The word ‘*Dharma*’ here is not restricted to the sense of *sacrifice*
and such other acts (prescribed by the Veda); it stands for the
*characteristic* of things in general. The meaning thus is that in each
Cycle, the character of things varies, as shown before (in verses 83 and
84); just as, for instance, the character of things during the Spring is
of one kind, of a different kind during the Summer, and of yet another
kind during the Rains,—so it is in connection with the Cycles also.

By ‘*difference*’ it is not meant that things cease to bring about
effects that they are found (at one time) to produce, and bring about
other effects; what is meant is that they become incapable of bringing
about their complete effects; and this by reason of the decrease in
their potency. This is what is meant by the phrase—‘*this being due to
the deterioration of each succeeding Cycle*,’—‘*deterioration*’ meaning
*inferiority*.—(85).

Buhler translates the verse to mean that the diversity of *Dharma* is
due to the *decrease in the length* of the yugas. This however is not
countenanced by any of the commentators, all of whom agree that the said
diversity is due to the relative *inferiority* of fine age to the other.

Medhātithi’s interpretation of 85 is not quite consistent with what
follows in 86; but he has taken care to disconnect 85 from 86; he
distinctly says that what is said in 86 is a ‘diversity in the character
of the yugas’ distinct from what has been set forth in 85. Really this
is made clear by the fact that in 85, the word ‘*Dharma*’ stands,
according to Medhātithi, not for duty, but for *characteristic*.

This verse is quoted in Hemādri—Pariśeṣa—Kāla, p. 657;—and in the
Smṛticandrikā—Saṃskāra, p. 27.

085	One set of duties (is prescribed) for men in the Krita age, different ones in the Treta and in the Dvapara, and (again) another (set) in the Kali, in a proportion as (those) ages decrease in length.
