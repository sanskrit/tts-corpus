After light, from out of the same Evolvent, emanates water, which has been declared to be endowed with the quality of taste. and after water, comes earth, endowed with the quality of odour.—Such is creation at the outset.—(78)

**रसो** मधुरादिः सलिलगुणः गन्धः सुरभिर् असुरभिश् च । स भूमेर् गुणः । तथा च वैशेषिकाः- "क्षिताव् एव गन्धः" इति (प्रभ् ४.१) । एते सांसिद्धिका एकैकस्य गुणाः संसर्गात् तु संकीर्यनते । तद् उक्तम् "यो यो यावतिथः" (म्ध् १.२०) इति । एतच् च गुणानुकथनम् अध्यात्मचिन्तायां उपयुज्यते । उक्तं हि पुराणकारेण-

- दश मन्वन्तराणीह तिष्ठन्तीन्द्रियचिन्तकाः ।

- भौतिकास् तु शतं पूर्णं सहस्रं त्व् अभिमानिनः ॥

अहंकारचिन्तकाः-

- महात्मकाः सहस्राणि दश तिष्ठन्ति विज्वराः ।

- पूर्णं शतसहस्रं तु तिष्ठन्त्य् अव्यक्तचिन्तकाः ।

- पुरुषं निर्गुणं प्राप्य परिसंख्या न विद्यते ॥ १.७८ ॥

‘*Taste*’—such as ‘*sweet*’ and the rest.,—is the quality of
Water.—‘*Odour*’ good smell and evil, is the quality of earth; as say
the *Vaiśeṣikas*—‘odour subsists in earth alone.’

Each of the single qualities that have been mentioned as belonging to
each of the elemental substances, is what is inherent in it by its very
nature; when, however, the substances come to be mixed up, their
qualities also become intermingled. It is in view of this that we have
the statement in verse 20 that—‘each elemental substance is endowed with
as many qualities as the place it occupies’.

This description of the qualities comes useful in meditation on the
soul. This has been thus declared by the author of the *Purāṇa*.—‘Those
who meditate upon the sense-organs (as the soul) stay here for ten
*manvantaras*; those who meditate upon the Elemental Substances stay for
a hundred, and those who meditate upon the Principle of Egoism stay for
a thousand *manvantaras*; \[‘*abhimāninaḥ*’ means those who think of the
Principle of Egoism\]; those who meditate upon the great Principle of
Intelligence stay for ten thousand *manvantaras*, freed from all
sufferings; for full hundred thousand years stay those who meditate upon
the Unmanifest (Primordial Matter); when one has reached the soul,
devoid of all qualities, all limitation ceases.’—(78)

of the Egg’ (Nandana).
