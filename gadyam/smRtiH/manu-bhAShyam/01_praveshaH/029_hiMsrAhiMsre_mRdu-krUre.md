Each being, when created again and again, naturally conformed to that same act to which the lord had, at first, directed him.—(28)


“The meaning assigned to the verse does not appear to be its right meaning at all. What appears to be its right meaning is that the Creator is entirely independent in assigning their work to the creatures. The verse thus means as follows:—‘Every creature conformed to,—i.e., carried on—that same action—in the form either of doing harm to others, or its contrary,—to which the Lord had directed it at—at the beginning of creation’; that is, man does not have recourse to actions, cither entirely on the advice of his father and other elders, or by his own will; in fact, whatever good or bad action he performs, he does wholly in accordance with Prajāpati’s directions, entirely uninfluenced by the advice of any other person.


‘When created again’—i.e., when born again, whether in another cycle, or in this same cycle,—it is Prajāpati alone who directs all animate beings to be the doers of actions; hence even past good and bad acts arc done by them only in obedience to the directions of Prajāpati; this has been thus declared:—‘They become agents without being masters of their own actions; to the good or the bad act they are led on by God’; and again ‘this ignorant creature has no control over his pleasure and pain; it is only as led on by God that he goes to heaven or to hell.’”

हिंस्राहिंस्रे मृदुक्रूरे धर्माधर्मावृतानृते । 
यद् यस्य सो'दधात् सर्गे तत् तस्य स्वयमाविशत् ॥ २९ ॥


hiṃsrāhiṃsre mṛdukrūre dharmādharmāvṛtānṛte | 
yad yasya so'dadhāt sarge tat tasya svayamāviśat || 29 ||


Hurtfulness or harmlessness, tenderness or hard-heartedness, virtue or vice, truthfulness or truth-lessness,—each of these accrued to that being in which he implanted it at creation.—(29)

**(verse xviii)**

Medhātithi notes two explanations of this verse.

The natural meaning appeal’s to be that ‘each being continues, in each
succeeding Birth, to betake itself to the same function that was
assigned to it in the beginning by Prajāpati.’

But this being incompatible with the law of Karma, which has been
regarded as adumbrated by Manu in I. 41,—Medhātithi has tried his best
to get out of the words the meaning that the conditions and activities
of each being are ordained in accordance with his past deeds;—but the
only argument that he puts forward in support of assigning this meaning
is that the literal meaning of the words would give rise to a number of
undesirable contingencies. According to Medhātithi, creation is due to
the joint action of the three causes—(1) the being’s past acts (2) God’s
will and (3) Evolution of Prakṛti.

The confusion of thought in regard to the exact meaning of this and the
following two verses is further shown by the fact that Medhātithi (p.
22, l, 27 under verse 30) has thought it necessary to set forth ‘another
explanation’ of these texts.

**(verse xviii-xix)**

*Mahābhārata*, 12.232.16.—‘Of the created things, whatever functions
became assigned to whichever thing at the beginning of creation, that
thing take to those same functions, whenever they are created again and
again.’ ‘Harmfulness or harmlessness, gentleness or ferociousness,
righteousness or unrighteousness, truthfulness or untruthfulness, with
one or the other of these they are obsessed, and hence are they fond of
just those.’
