Thereafter, the supreme being Hiraṇyagarbha, self-born, unmanifest and bringing into view this (universe), appeared,—dispelling darkness and having his (creative) power operating upon the Elemental Substances and other things.—(6)

After the above described Great Night;—the ‘*Self-born*,’ he who comes
into existence by himself; *i.e*. who takes up a body by his own will,
his taking the body not being dependent upon his past acts, as it is in
the case of beings undergoing births and deaths.

‘*Unmanifest*,’—not cognizable by people devoid of ability to
contemplate and other powers produced by the practice of *yoga*. Or, it
would be better to read ‘*avyakṭam*’ (in the Accusative), making it an
epithet of ‘*idam*,’ ‘this;’ the meaning being ‘this universe which was
in its unmanifest condition.’

‘*Bringing into view*’—making it perceptible in the form of the grosser
products; that is, he by whose wish the World comes into existence.

‘*Appeared*’—the term ‘*Prāduḥ* (?)’—denotes *visibility*.

‘*Dispelling darkness*,’—‘darkness’ stands for the state of dissolution;
he dispells, sets aside, that state; he creates the World afresh and is
therefore said to ‘dispel darkness.’

‘*Elemental Substances*,’ earth and the rest.

‘*Other things*’—refers to Sound and other qualities of the said
substances;—he has his ‘power’ *i.e*. creative power—‘operating,’
acting, upon the said substances &c. The Elemental Substances by
themselves are incapable of producing the World; when however the
requisite potency is instilled into them by him, they become transformed
into the shape of trees and other things. The term ‘Elemental
Substances’ here does not stand for the substances, which at the
beginning of ‘creation,’ exist in the form of potencies lying latent in
Primordial Matter.

Another reading is ‘*mahābhūtānuvṛttaujāḥ*;’ ‘*anuvṛttam*, meaning *bent
upon*; the meaning of the epithet remains the same as before. (6)

‘*Mahābhūtādī*’—Here again Rāghavānanda, the Vedantin, is at variance
with the other commentators, and takes it in the sense of ‘*Akaṅkāra*,’
and not in that of ‘the Elemental Substances &c,’

‘*Prādurāsīt*’—‘assumed a body of his own free will, not in consequence
of his *Karma?*: (Medhātithi, Kullūka, Govinda, Nandana);—‘became
discernible’: (Nārāyaṇa)—‘became ready to create’: (Rāghavānanda)

The reader should refer to the latter portion of the *Bhāṣya* on verse
11, where the present verse is explained as setting forth the
self-evolution of *Prakṛti*, according to the *Sāṅkhya*.

006	Then the divine Self-existent (Svayambhu, himself) indiscernible, (but) making (all) this, the great elements and the rest, discernible, appeared with irresistible (creative) power, dispelling the darkness.
