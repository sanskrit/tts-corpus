Among Brāhmaṇas, the learned are the best, among the learned, those with firm convictions, among the men with firm convictions, those that act up to them; and among the actors, those that know Brahman.—(97).

विदुषां श्रैष्ठ्यं महाफलेषु यागादिष्व् अधिकारात् । तेषाम् अपि **कृतबुद्धयः** । परिनिष्ठितवेदतत्त्वार्था न बौद्धादिभिः कलुषीक्रियन्ते । तेषाम् अपि **कर्तारः** कर्मणाम् अनुष्ठातारः । ते हि विहितकरणात् प्रतिषिद्धासेवनाच् च नोपहन्यन्ते । तेषाम् अपि **ब्रह्मवेदिनः**,[^१४५] ब्रह्मस्वरूपत्वात् । तत्र ह्य् अक्षय्यानन्दः ॥ १.९७ ॥

_विद्वत्तादिगुणसंबन्धिनो ब्राह्मणस्य विशेषे दर्शिते, जातिमात्रं ब्राह्मणं कश्चिद् अवमन्येत । तन्निवृत्त्यर्थम् इदम् उच्यते ।_[^१४६]

The superiority of the learned rests on the fact that it is they alone
that are entitled to the performance of sacrifices that lead to great
results. Among these ‘*those with firm convictions*’—who have acquired
firm knowledge of the essence of the Veda, and are never affected
(adversely) by *Bauḍḍhas* and other heretics.—Among these again ‘*those
that act up to them*’—*i.e*., the performer of actions; these persons
doing what is enjoined and avoiding what is prohibited, are never
attacked (by evil).—Among these, *those that know* ‘*Brahman*’; those
that know Brahman become of the nature of Brahman, and therein lies
imperishable bliss. (97).

‘*Kṛtabuddhayaḥ*’—‘who know the Veda and its meaning (Medhātithi,
Nārāyaṇa and Nandana);—’ ‘Knowing the truth’ (Sarvajña-nārāyaṇa and
Rāmacandra),—‘who recognise the necessity of doing what is prescribed in
the scriptures’ (Kullūka);—‘determined’ (Rāghavānanda).
