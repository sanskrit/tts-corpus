The ‘Time-cycles’ of the Gods, one thousand in number, should be regarded as one ‘day’ of brahmā; and (his) ‘night’ also is of the same extent.—(72)

देवयुगसाहस्रं **ब्राह्मम् एकम् अहः** । **तावती** ब्रह्मणो **रात्रिर्** देवयुगसहस्रम् एव । **परिसंख्यया** संख्यानेन यत् सहस्रम् इति संबन्धः । श्लोकपूरणार्थश् चायम् अनुवादः । न ह्य् असंख्यया सहस्रादिव्यवहारः । हेतौ तृतीया ॥ १.७२ ॥

Thousand ‘Time-cycles’ of the Gods make one ‘day’ of Brahmā.—Brahmā’s
night also ‘*is of the same extent*’—*i.e*., as long as thousand
‘Time-cycles’ of the Gods.—‘*In number*’ —*i.e*., which in computation,
is *one thousand*; the adding of this term is only for the purpose of
tilling up the verse; for a thing cannot be spoken of as a‘thousand’
except *in number*.

The instrumental ending (in ‘*Sāṅkhyayā*’) denotes *causality*.

072	But know that the sum of one thousand ages of the gods (makes) one day of Brahman, and that his night has the same length.
