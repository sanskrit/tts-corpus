पङ्क्तिपावनो भवति । विशिष्टानुपूर्वीकः संघातः **पङ्क्तिर्** उच्यते । तां **पुनाति** निर्मलीकरोति । सर्वे दुष्टास् तत्संनिधानाद् अदुष्टाः संपद्यन्ते । **वंश्यान्** स्वकुलसंभूतान् **सप्त** **पराण्** उपरितनान् पित्रादीन् आगामिनो **ऽवराञ्** जनिष्यमाणान् । समुद्रपर्यन्तां **पृथिवीं** प्रतिग्रहीतुम् अर्हन्ति । धर्मज्ञता हि प्रतिग्रहाधिकारे हेतुः । इतश् च सर्वे धर्मा ज्ञायन्ते ॥ १.१०५ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

He becomes the sanctifier of his company; ‘*company*’ stands here for a
number of persons arranged in a particular order; this ‘*he purifies*,’
makes free from taint; *i.e*., all sinful men, by associating with him,
become sinless.

‘*Kindreds*’—persons born in his own family ;—‘*seven higher*,’ those
above him, the Father &c., and ‘*seven lower*,’ those that are to come,
yet to be born.

He alone is entitled to receive the gift of this earth extending to the
oceans; ‘knowledge of Dharma’ establishes a claim to become the
recipient; hence it is that a full knowledge of Dharma is sought to be
acquired.—(105)
