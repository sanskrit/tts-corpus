The evanescent subtile constituents of the half-ten (Elemental Substances) that have been described,—along with those, this whole (world) comes forth, in due order.—(27)

This verse sums up what has gone before.

‘*Of the half-ten*’—*i.e*., of the five elemental substances;—‘*the
subtile*,’—minute,—‘*constituents*,’—parts; *i.e*., the ‘Rudimentary
substances’; these are ‘*evanescent*’;—they are called ‘evanescent’
(liable to destruction) in the sense that, being liable to undergo
modifications, they take up grosser forms.—‘*along with those*,' ‘*this
whole*’—world,—‘*comes forth*,’—is produced;—‘*in due order*,’—in proper
sequence; *i.e*., from the subtile the gross, and from the gross the
grosser; or in the order in which they have been described (in the
foregoing verses).—(27)

‘*Vināśinyaḥ*’—because liable to change into gross substances
(Medhātithi, Govinda and Kullūka); or because they are *products*
(Rāghavā.)

The commentators are at some pains to explain the incongruity of the
inter-position of the present verse in the middle of what purports to be
a connected account of the process of creation. Medhātithi says the
verse serves the purpose of summing up what has been said so
far;—Govindarāja and Kullūka make it serve the purpose of setting aside
the notion that the creation was accomplished by Brahman without the
help of the ‘principles’;—and Nārāyaṇa holds that it is meant to lay
stress upon the non-eternality of atoms;—Nandana has solved the
difficulty by placing this verse after verse 19.

027	But with the minute perishable particles of the five (elements) which have been mentioned, this whole (world) is framed in due order.
