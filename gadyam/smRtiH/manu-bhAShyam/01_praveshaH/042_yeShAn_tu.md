That kind of action which belongs to the several beings has been described here. I am now going to explain the manner of their birth.—(42) 


“Where has the action been described? In Verses 37 et seq. what occurs is only the mention of the names of several beings, Yakṣa, Rākṣasa and the rest; and their action is not mentioned at all.”

‘*That kind of action which belongs to the several beings*,’—*i.e*.,
hurtful or harmless—‘*has been already described*’;—now ‘*I am going to
explain the manner of their birth*.’

*Objection*.—

> “Where has the *action* been described? In Verses 37 *et seq*. what
> occurs is only the mention of the names of several beings, *Yakṣa,
> Rākṣasa* and the rest; and their action is not mentioned at all.”

Our answer is as follows:—The action of each being is indicated by its
name; the particular name being acquired by each being by reason of its
actions: for instance, the *Yakṣas* are so called because of the act of
*worshpping*, or *pervading* (‘*Yakṣaṇa*’);—the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ are so
called because of the act of *destroying in secret* (‘*rahasi
kṣaṇana*’);—the *Piśāchas* are so called because of the act of devouring
flesh (‘*piśitāśana*’);—the *Apsarases* are so called because of the act
of *issuing forth from water* (*adbhyaḥ ṣṛtāḥ*);— the *Asuras* are so
called because of the act of *not obtaining surā*, in the form of
nectar; and so on, the significance of the other names may be traced.

‘*The manner of their birth*’—*i.e*., they are *viviparous, oviparous*
and the like; going to be described in the following verses.—(42)
