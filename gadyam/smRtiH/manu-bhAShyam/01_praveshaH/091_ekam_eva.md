‘*The Lord*’, Prajāpati, ordained ‘*one function, for the Śūdra*’; \[in
the form\]—‘Thou shalt perform the ‘*service of the said
castes*,’—*i.e*., of the Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya and
Vaiśya;—‘*Ungrudging*’—*i.e*., without complaining; no resentment should
be felt even in the mind.

‘*Service*’ stands for *attending; i.e*., doing of acts conducive to
their convenience; such as massage of the body, and the obeying of
wishes.

What is mentioned here is only such function of the Śūdra as leads to
visible results (in the shape of livelihood); and in as much as the
phrase ‘*one only*’ is not injunctive, it does not preclude *the giving
of gifts* (and such other acts, leading to invisible results); specially
as we shall find later on the actual injunction of these acts (for the
*Śūdra* also). And it will be on that occasion that we shall set forth
the classification of sacrifices and other acts (as to which of these
should be done by which castes, and so forth). (91).

This verse is quoted in the *Vīramitrodaya* — *Paribhāṣā*, p. 45;—and in
the *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 568), which explains ‘*Prabhuḥ*,’ ‘as
Brahmā,’ and ‘*Anasūyayā*’ as ‘without dishonesty.’
