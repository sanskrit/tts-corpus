‘*He*’—who,—by virtue of the qualities described in the preceding verse,
and also by virtue of such Vedic texts as ‘In the beginning there
appeared Hiraṇyagarbha &c.’ (Ṛgveda 10.121.1)—acquired the title of
‘*Hiraṇyagarbha*.’

‘*Several kinds of created things*’—things possessed of various forms.

‘*Desiring to create*,’—wishing to bring into existence.

‘*In the beginning*,’ first of all—‘produced,’ called into
being—‘*water*’ ‘*out of his own body*,’ *i.e*., the body assumed by
himself (on manifestation). Or, according to the Ádvaita Philosophy,
‘Primordial Matter’ is the ‘body’ of Hiraṇyagarbha here spoken of; it is
‘*his own*’ in the sense that it follows his wish, and is the cause of
the production of all bodies.

The next question that arises is—“When he created the body of all living
beings, did he do so by means of some physical act, such as digging with
the spade and so forth (as the potter does in the making of the Jar)?”

The answer is *no*.—“How then?”—‘*By mere willing*’—by the mere act of
wishing ‘let water be produced.’

The following further question is raised—“Since the Earth and other
things were non-existent at the time, what was the receptacle or
standing ground of the water that was produced?”

The question is addressed to the winds! \[ *lit*., it is as good as
addressed to others!\]. It might just as well bo asked—what is the
receptacle or standing ground for the Supreme Lord himself when he has
assumed a body. If it be explained that so far as the powers of the
creator himself are concerned, no questions arise, for the simple reason
that he is possessed of unique powers,—then the same may be said in
regard to water and the other products also, which may be regarded as
having similar unique powers.

*In that*, water, *he threw*, scattered, *the seed*, the semen. (8)

\(3\) *Abhidhyāya*—According to those who interpret the process here as
‘described in accordance with the *Saṅkhya*’, this means ‘independently
of all outside force, just as a man does an act by mere thought.’

*Āpaḥ*—In his eagerness to be literally faithful, Buhler has translated
this as ‘*waters*’, using the plural form in consideration of the plural
form of ‘*āpaḥ*’ in the plural. It has to be borne in mind, however,
that the text has used the plural form, because the base ‘*ap*’ has no
singular form at all.

*Vide*, in this connection, *Ṛgveda*, 10.121.1, and [Viṣṇu-purāṇa
I](/hinduism/book/the-viśnu-purana-2/d/doc115935.html "English translation by Horace Hayman Wilson").

*Saḥ*—Hiraṇyagarbha (acc. to Medhātithi); the Paramātman (according to
others.)

*Abhidhyāya*—According to the interpretation of ‘others’, noted by
Medhātithi, under verse 11, this participle means ‘independently of all
external activity, just as a man may do some act by merely willing it.’

*Medhātithi* P. 11, l. 6—‘*anyebhya idamucyate*’—This is an idiomatic
expression used in the sense—‘This that is urged is spoken, as it were,
to others—it does not concern us,—it has no hearing upon what we have
said.’
