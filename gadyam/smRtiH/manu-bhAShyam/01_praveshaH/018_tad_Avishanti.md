The great elemental substances, along with their functions, as also the mind, along with its subtile components, enter into that which (on that account) is the generator of all things and imperishable.—(18)

‘*That*,’ ‘Primordial Matter—is ‘the generator of all things’:—it is
‘*imperishable*,’ *i.e*., in its original (causal) form it is
indestructible.

“In what way does Primordial Matter *generate* all things?”

Because all these *enter into it*.

“What are *all these* that enter into it?”

First of all ‘*the Mind along with its subtile components*,’—*i.e*.,
along with the Rudimentary Substances, the Principle of Intelligence,
the Principle of Egoism and the Sense-organs;—and then, the *Great
Elemental Substances*—called ‘Earth,’ ‘Water,’ ‘Fire,’ ‘Wind,’ and
‘Ākāśa;’—‘*along with their functions*;—

1.  sustaining,
2.  conglutination,
3.  cooking,
4.  configuration
5.  and making room (unobstruction) respectively are the ‘functions’ of
    Earth, &c.

Of these

1.  ‘sustaining’ means upholding, keeping in their places, things that
    are prone to falling;
2.  ‘conglutination’ means bringing together things that are loose and
    disjointed; *e.g*., loose and disjointed dust-particles are brought
    togther, cemented into, a mass by means of water;—
3.  ‘Cooking’ is the well-known effect produced by fire upon such
    tilings as medicine and herbs, &c.;
4.  ‘Configuration’ means conformation, shaping;—
5.  ‘making room’ means non-obstruction by another body; in a point in
    space where one body is already present, there can be no room for
    another body; *e.g*., no object can find room within a piece of
    gold.

‘*Mind*’—is meant to indicate all the organs of sensation; and the term
‘*Karma*’ may be taken as referring to the organs of action; or again,
in the first line of the text, the term ‘*Karma*’ may be taken to mean
the ‘products’ of the elementary substances; the sense of the passage
being that ‘subsequently the products of the elemental substances, along
with the subtile components, enter into the great elemental
substances’—‘as also do the organs of sensation,’ this latter being
indicated by the word ‘*Mind*.’—(18)

Buhler supplies the translation of the verse according to the five
interpretations offered by the commentators.

1.  The text here represents the explanation given by *Medhātithi*:—
2.  According to *Govinda* and Kullūka the verse means—‘From Brahman are
    produced the gross elements, together with their functions, and the
    Mind, which is the producer of all beings through its minute
    portions, and imperishable’.—
3.  According to *Rāghavānanda*—‘That gross body the gross elements
    enter, and the Mind, which is the producer of all beings and
    imperishable, together with the actions and with the limbs.’—
4.  According to *Nandana*—‘As that body of Hiraṇyagarbha, though
    through its small portions it produces all beings, ye tis
    imperishable,—even thus the Great Beings and the Mind, with the
    actions enter it.’—
5.  According to *Nārāyana*—‘That subtile body the gross elements enter,
    together with the *Karma* and the Mind, the producer of all beings
    and imperishable, together with its minute portions.’

Dr. Buhler’s rendering of this verse is not approved by Hopkins. The
construction of the sentence is the same in all cases—*mahānti bhūtāni
karmabhiḥ saha—manaśca sūkṣmaiḥ avayavaiḥ*.

Medhātithi himself offers a second explanation.
