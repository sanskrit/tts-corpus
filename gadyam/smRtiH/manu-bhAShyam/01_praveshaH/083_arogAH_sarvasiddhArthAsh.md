By reason of the absence of vice, which is the cause of disease, men are
‘*free from disease*’; ‘*disease*’stands for *sickness*.—‘All,’ the four
castes, have their desired purposes accomplished; ‘aim’ stands for
purpose; or (it may mean) the results following from all their acts with
purposes are duly obtained; on account of the absence of obstacles,
*all* result are obtained without fail.

‘*Their life lasts through four hundred years*’—“But we find the highest
age described as 1600 years, in the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad* (3.16.7), where
it is said ‘he lived for sixteen hundred years’.”

It is in view of this that it has been held that the term ‘*hundred
years*’ here stands for the *stages of life*; the meaning thus being
that ‘*they live through all the four stages of life*,’—man’s life is
never shortened, they never die without having reached the fourth stage.
That such is the meaning is shown by the fact that in the second half of
the verse we have the assertion ‘*vayo hrasati*,’ ‘*life becomes
shortened*’; this subsequent mention of the ‘shorterning of life’ would
have some point only if the ‘lengthening of life’ were spoken of in the
preceding sentence.

‘*Quarter by quarter*’—the term ‘quarter’ here does not stand for the
*fourth part*, it stands only for *part*; the meaning being that ‘man’s
life becomes shortened *in part*’, i.e. some die while they are young
children, others on reaching youth, and others on attaining old age; and
the full span of life is difficult to attain.—(83)

‘*Quarter by quarter*’—The natural meaning is that men lived for 400
years during *Kṛta*, 300 years during *Tretā*, 200 years during
*Dvāpara* and 100 years during *Kali* But in view of the assertion in
the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad* of a man having lived for 1600 years (3.16.17)
Medhātithi has been forced to remark that ‘quarter’ here stands for
*part*, and not for the precise *fourth part*, and to explain the text
to mean that ‘man’s life becomes shortened *in part*; some die while
they are young children, others on reaching youth and others on
attaining old age.’

The *Aparārka* (p. 1012) quotes the first line in support of the view
that each cycle has a distinct character of its own.
