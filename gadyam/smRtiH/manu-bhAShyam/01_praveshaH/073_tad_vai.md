Those who know the ‘Day of Brahmā’ as ending with the (said) thousand ‘time-cycles,’ and the ‘night’ also as of the same extent,—are people who alone know what is ‘day and night’, and acquire merit.—(73)

युगसहस्रम् अन्तो यस्याह्नस् **तद् युगसहस्रान्तम्** । ये मनुष्या[^१०८] एतज् जानते **ते ऽहोरात्रविदः** । किं तेषाम् इत्य् अपेक्षायां पुण्यं भवतीति संबन्धः । ब्राह्मस्याह्नः परिमाणवेदनं पुण्यम् अतस् तद् वेदितव्यम् इति स्तुत्या विधिप्रतिपत्तिः ॥ १.७३ ॥

‘*Yugasahasrāntam*,’—‘that of which the thousand cycles are the
end;’—those men who know this, ‘*they are the people who alone know what
is Day and Night*.’

If it be asked—what happens to the people who know this?—it is added
that ‘*they acquire merit*.’ Such is the connection (of the word
‘*puṇyam*’). The sense is that ‘knowledge of Brahmā’s Day and Night is
conducive to merit, and hence this knowledge should be acquired;’—this
injunction (of acquiring the said knowledge) being implied by the
valediction contained in the verse.—(73)

‘*Puṇyam*’—Medhātithi takes this not merely as an epithet of ‘*ahaḥ*,’
but as constituting a distinct sentence by itself.

073	Those (only, who) know that the holy day of Brahman, indeed, ends after (the completion of) one thousand ages (of the gods) and that his night lasts as long, (are really) men acquainted with (the length of) days and nights.
