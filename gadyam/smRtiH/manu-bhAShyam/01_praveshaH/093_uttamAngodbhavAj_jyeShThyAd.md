In matters regauding ‘Dharma’, the Brāhmaṇa is the Lord of this whole world;—because he sprang out of the best part of (Prajāpati’s) body, because he is the eldest ok all, and because he upholds the Veda.—(98)

This verse explains what follows from what has been said in the
preceding verse. ‘*The best part of the body*,’—the head; from out of
that sprang, was born, the Brāhmaṇa.—He is also ‘*the eldest of
all*,’—the Brāhmaṇa was produced before the other castes .— ‘*Because he
upholds the Brahman, i.e., Veda*’; the upholding of the Veda has been
specifically prescribed for him.—‘*Hence*,’—for all these three
reasons,—‘*the Brāhmaṇa is the lord*,’—*i.e*., as if he were the lord
—‘*of this whole world*’; *i.e*., he should be approached (treated) like
the lord; and people should obey his orders in matters relating to
*Dharma.—‘Dharmataḥ prabhuḥ*’ means ‘*dharme prabhuḥ*,’—‘Lord in matters
regarding *Dharma*,’—the affix ‘*tasi*’ (in ‘*dharmataḥ*’) being added
according to the *Vārtika* on Pāṇini 5.4.44, which lays down the use of
this affix in connection with such terms as ‘*ādya*’ and the like. (93)

‘*Dharmataḥ prabhuḥ*’—‘The lord, by law’—according to Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana. But Medhātithi takes it to mean that ‘*he is the lord, in
matters relating to Dharma*’; *i.e*., he is the person entitled to
prescribe the duties of men and as such, is like the lord;—Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda accept the latter explanation.

093	As the Brahmana sprang from (Brahman's) mouth, as he was the first-born, and as he possesses the Veda, he is by right the lord of this whole creation.
