One month (of men) forms the ‘day and night’ of the ‘Pitṛs’; and their division is by fortnights: the darker fortnight, conducive to activity, is ‘Day,’ and the lighter fortnight, conducive to repose, is ‘Night.’—(66)

That which is the ‘month’ of men is a ‘day and night’ of the ‘*Pitṛs*.’
As regards ‘division’ as to which part is ‘day’ and which ‘night,’—this
division, that ‘this is *day* and that is *night*,’ is determined ‘*by
fortnights,’ i.e*., the *fifteen days*, which are known by the name of
‘half-month.’ That is, the said division is based upon fortnights: one
fortnight is ‘day,’ and another fortnight is ‘night.’ In view of the
fact that ‘day’ and ‘night’ differ in their character and occur in a
fixed order of sequence, the author adds the following distinction:—The
darker fortnight is ‘day,’ and the brighter fortnight, ‘night.’

The right reading (in view of the meaning intended) would be
‘*Karmaceṣṭābhyaḥ*’ (the Dative form), just as we have ‘*svapnāya*’; for
the meaning meant to be conveyed is that the day is *for the purpose* of
‘activity.’ Hence the Locative ending in the text can be explained only
as used on account of the exigencies of metre.—(66)

The ‘day’ and ‘night’ of Pitṛs is regulated by the Moon, just as those
of gods and men is by the Sun.

This verse has been quoted in the *Kālaviveka* (p. 112) in support of
the view that the seasons and other calculations are not governed by the
‘Lunar Month,’—which only serves the purpose of being the ‘Day-Night’ of
Pitṛs; the darker fortnight being their ‘day,’ and the brighter
fortnight ‘night’.

The same work quotes it again on p. 308, in support of the view that
‘from *Pratipat* to *Amāvāsyā* is the dark fortnight, and from
*Pratipat* to *Purṇamāsi* is the Bright Fortnight.’

066	A month is a day and a night of the manes, but the division is according to fortnights. The dark (fortnight) is their day for active exertion, the bright (fortnight) their night for sleep.
