‘*Udbhid*’ stands for ‘*udbhedana*,’ *the act of splitting*; the
‘*kvip*’ affix having a nominal force;—‘*those that are* *duced by
splitting* are ‘*udbhijja*’; they are so called because they come into
existence by *splitting* the seed and *breaking through* the soil; and
these are *plants; all* these plants ‘*grown out of seeds and slips*’
and become fixed in their places by means of roots and trunks and other
such things.

‘*Oṣadhyaḥ*’—the right form is ‘*oṣadhayaḥ*’ (because the base ends in
short *i*). Or we may take the word as a form of the base with the long
*ī*; this lengthening of the vowel being explained, either as according
to the *Vārtika* on Pāṇini 4.1.45, or as a Vedic anomily.

The natural characteristic feature of these *oṣadhis*—*i.e*., Annuals—is
as follows: ‘*They with the ripening of their fruit*’;—*i.e*, the
ripening of the fruit constitutes their *end* or *perishing*; as a
matter of fact, the paddy and other such plants perish as soon as their
fruit has ripened. They also abound in, are endowed with, many fruits
and flowers.

What is stated in this verse is the distinguishing characteristic of
*oṣadhis* (Annual plants), and what follows in the following verse,
constitutes the distinguishing feature of *Vṛkṣas* (Perennial Trees);
the characters mentioned being attributed to them in accordance with
actual facts.—(40)

Medhātithi takes ‘*udbhijjāḥ sthāvarāḥ*’ as the subject, and
‘*bījakāṇḍaprarohiṇaḥ*’ as the predicate of the sentence. Buhler
reverses this.
