‘*The said Virāj, having performed austerities*,’ produced a person;
*know*—*i.e*., recognise—that person to be myself;—there is nothing that
is not already known to you, by tradition, which I could describe to
you; all that the speaker intends to point out is the purity of his own
birth.

The phrase ‘*the creator of this whole world*’ indicates his almighty
character. The idea of the speaker is that ‘the describing of myself as
one of excellent birth and superior powers of action will make me more
trustworthy.’

Or, the mention of his own birth might be for the purpose of carrying
conviction (removing all doubts); that such may be the sense is shown by
the fact that, though the origin of Manu is already known from other
sources, yet he himself mentions it; for instance, even though a person
is already known from other sources (as the son of a certain person),
yet he is asked—‘are you Devadatta’s son?’—and he answers ‘yes’;
whereupon certainty of conviction is brought about.

Poets are not ashamed of describing the nobility of their own birth,
even though their glories may be already well known.

‘*O best of Brāhmaṇas*’—is the form of address; ‘*best*’ ** means *most
perfect*, most superior.—(33)
