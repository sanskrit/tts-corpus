**एवम्** इति प्रक्रान्तप्रकारप्रत्ययपरामर्शः[^८६] । **एतैर् महात्मभिर्** मरीच्यादिभिः । **इदं सर्वं स्थावरजङ्गमं सृष्टम्** । **यथाकर्म** यस्य जन्मान्तरे यादृशं कर्म तदपेक्षम् । यस्यां जातौ यस्य तु युक्तम् उतपत्तुं कर्मवशात् स तस्याम् एवोत्पादितः । **मन्नियोगान्** मदाज्ञया । **तपोयोगान्** महत्कृत्वा तपः । यावत् किंचिन् महद् ऐश्वर्यं तत् सर्वं तपसा प्राप्य्म् इत्य् एतद् अनेनाह ॥ १.४१ ॥

‘*In this manner*,’—refers to the manner discribed above;—‘*by these
high-souled sages*,’—Marīci and the rest;—‘*all* *this, movable and
immovable, teas called into their actions*,’—the creation of each being
was in keeping with the nature of the action done by it during other
lives; that is, each being was made to be born in that family of animals
which was the right one for it, in view of its past acts;—‘*under my
direction*’—by my order;—‘*through the force of austerities*,’—having
performed severe austerities; what this is meant to show is that any
kind of great power can be acquired only by means of austerities.—(41)
