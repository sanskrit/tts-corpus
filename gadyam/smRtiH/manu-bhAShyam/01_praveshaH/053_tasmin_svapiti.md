The meaning of this verse is quite clear, its meaning having been
already explained.

‘*Having retired within himself*’—*i.e*., in calm repose, i *e*., in
pure pristine nature of the Soul at rest;—‘*retiring within himself*’
stands for the cessation of all accidental diversities.

‘*Active*’—the conscious beings who are fallen in the cycle of births
and deaths, and for whom *Action* is of the greatest
importance;—‘*embodied beings*,’—so called because they feel the effects
of being connected with a body which is the effect of their own past
acts.

‘*When he slumbers*,’ all these ‘*desist from their actions*,’—this
stands for the cessation of their *bodily* activity;—‘*their mind falls
into depression*’—this stands for the cessation of their mental
activity. Thus this cessation of bodily and mental activities indicates
the state of Dissolution.—‘*Depression*’ means absence of energy,
disability to carry on its functions; this is what the Mind *falls
into*,—attains.—(53)

‘*Karmāṭmānaḥ*’—It is not correct to say, as Buhler does, that this term
according to Medhātithi, means ‘who, in consequence of their actions,
become incorporate because as a matter of fact, this latter explanation
is supplied. by Medhātithi in reference to the term ‘*śarīriṇaḥ*’; what
he means is that th e Beings are called ‘*śarīriṇaḥ*’ not because the
Body is their natural accompaniment, but because they become equipped
with, them in consequence of their acts,

053	But when he reposes in calm sleep, the corporeal beings whose nature is action, desist from their actions and mind becomes inert.
