The ‘Mind’ impelled by (Brahmā’s) desire to create, evolves creation;—from out of that (Mind) is produced Ākāśa; of this they know sound to be the quality.—(75)

Though the creation of the ‘Principles’ has been already described, it
is stated again for the purpose of pointing out the details not set
forth before.

*Vikurute*, ‘*evolves*,’—*i.e*., being impelled, by Brahmā, it brings
about creation in a particular manner;—from out of the ‘Mind’ (*i.e*.,
the Great Principle of Intelligence), thus propelled (to modification)
is produced *Ākāśa*; and this *Ākāśa* possesses the quality known as
‘Sound ‘*Quality*’ is that which subsists (in a substance); and the
substratum of the quality of Sound is *Ākāśa*, in the sense that no
Sound is possible apart from *Ākāśa*.—(75)
