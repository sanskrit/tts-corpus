In the Cycles other than the *Kṛta*;—‘*from the scriptures*,’ called
‘Veda’;—‘*virtue*’—‘*foot by foot*’—by one foot in each succeeding
Cycle,—‘*fell off*,’ was carried away;—the Vedic Texts disappeared, by
reason of the deterioration in the powers of learning and assimilating
of men (le arning the texts).

The ‘*virtuous acts*’—in the form of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other
sacrifices, that are performed now a days,—these also ‘*deteriorated
foot by foot*’ on account of ‘*theft*’ &c.; *i.e*., since Priests,
Sacrifices, Bestowers and Recipients of gifts, are all beset with the
said evils, the virtuous act is not accomplished in the proper manner,
and hence the result mentioned (as accruing from that act) also is not
attained. In as much as this is the real meaning, we do not take
‘*theft*’ and the rest as applied to each of the three Cycles
respectively; specially as all of them (theft &c.,) are found prevalent
even now a days (in *Kali*)—(82).

This verse also has been variously interpreted:—(*a*) According to
Medhātithi it means that during the *Tretā, Dvāpara*, and *Kali* cycles,
‘Dharma fell off from the scriptures, foot by foot, and that there was
deterioration foot by foot in the fruit of Dharma also,—the reason for
this latter fact lying in the prevalence of theft, falsehood and fraud
*during all these three cycles*’; and he emphasises the fact that theft
eta, are not to be token as pertaining to the three cycles
respectively;—(*b*) according to Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, the
meaning is that during the three cycles, *by reason of unjust gains*
(‘*āgamāt*’) Dharma successively loses one foot etc., eta;—(*c*)
Govindarāja agrees with Medhātithi, hut with this difference that he
appears to favour the view that the deterioration in the results of acts
is due to theft, falsehood and fraud *respectively*,—the view that has
been repudiated by Medhātithi;—(*d*) according to Nandana—‘it having
been declared in the preceding verse that in the Kṛta-cycle there were
no scriptures, it is now said that during the other three cycles, Dharma
*is* determined by the scriptures,—and it diminishes successively in
each age by one quarter.’

This verse is quoted in the Vīramitrodaya—Paribhāṣā, p. 50.

082	In the other (three ages), by reason of (unjust) gains (agama), Dharma is deprived successively of one foot, and through (the prevalence of) theft, falsehood, and fraud the merit (gained by men) is diminished by one fourth (in each).
