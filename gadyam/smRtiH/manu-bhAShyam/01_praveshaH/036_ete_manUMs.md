The aforesaid Great Sages. ‘*called* *into being the seven Manus*’;
‘Manu’ is the name of the office; that person is called ‘Manu’ who,
during a particular ‘*Manvantara*’ (Cycle), controls the creating and
maintaining of all created things, in the manner described.

‘*Bkūritejasaḥ*,’ ‘mighty,’ and ‘*amitaujasaḥ*,’ ‘possessing illimitable
power,’—both terms mean the same thing; the former with the nominative
ending qualifies the *creators*, and the latter, with the accusative
ending, qualifies those *created*, Manus and the rest.

*Question*:—“But the gods were created by Brahmā himself (as already
described in Verse 22).”

*Answer*:—True; but not all of them; there are endless kinds of gods.

‘*Gods*’ *habitations*’—The abode of the gods, such as the Celestial
Region, the ‘Region of Brahman,’ and so forth.—(36)

‘*Manūn*’—The name ‘Manu’ here stand for *that Being* whose function it
is to create all creatures and to maintain the entire world during a
*manvantara*, and apparently belongs to the *office*. Some Mss. read
‘*munīn*’.

‘*Devanikāyān*—‘Classes of gods’ (according to Nandana and
Nārāyaṇa);—‘abodes of gods’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda); the
last of these suggests also the meaning ‘servants of the gods’.
