<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Worms*’— extremely small living tilings.—‘*Beetles*’—are slightly
larger than worms and crawl on the ground. —‘*Moths*,’
locusts.—‘*Immovable things*’—trees, mountains, etc.;—‘*of several
kinds*,’ of different varieties.

The copulative compounds in the singular are in accordance with Pāṇini’s
Sutra 2.1.8, by which copulative compounds formed of the names of small
living beings take the singular ending.—(10)
