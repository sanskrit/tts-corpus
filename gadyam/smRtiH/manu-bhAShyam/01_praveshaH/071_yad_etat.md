‘*Yadetat*’ (in the sense of ‘this’) is an ordinary expression; and as a
whole it means *that which has been spoken of*.—‘*This period of four
Time-cycles that has been* *computed*’—*i.e*., the exact number of years
in which have been definitely determined before this verse,—e.g. in
verse 69, where the number of years in the Time-cycles is declared to be
*four thousand* etc., etc.,—‘*Twelve thousand*’ of this period of four
Time-cycles are called the ‘*Time-cycle of the Gods*’. That is to say
the *Divine Cycle* consists of twelve thousand ‘Four-Cycles.’

The word ‘*Sāhasram*’ is derived from the word ‘*sahasra*’ with the
reflexive affix ‘*aṇ*’; and the compound ‘*dvādaśasāhasram*’ is to be
expounded as ‘*dvādaśa-sahasrāṇi parimāṇe yasmin*’, ‘that in which the
measure is that of twelve-thousands’.—(71)

Burnell remarks—“According to the commentators the translation should
run thus: ‘The four Yugas just reckoned (consisting of) twelve thousand
years are called a *Yuga* of the gods.” This is the translation adopted
by Buhler also. What is not quite accurate is the statement that such a
translation is “according to the commentators”,—when we find that
according to Medhātithi at least, the meaning of the verse is as it is
represented by Burnell in his text. Medhātithi says
explicitly—‘*dvādaśa-chaturyuga—sahasrāṇi devayugam nāma kāla
ityarthaḥ*’.

In face of the fact that the words of the text themselves convey this
meaning—which involves the ‘lengthening’ of the ordinary into divine
years,—it is difficult to understand Burnell’s remark that this
‘lengthening’ ‘is the work of commentators.’ On the contrary, on
Burnell’s own showing, the ‘commentators’ would appear to have
*shortened* the great length of the divine year clearly expressed by the
words of the text.

071	These twelve thousand (years) which thus have been just mentioned as the total of four (human) ages, are called one age of the gods.
