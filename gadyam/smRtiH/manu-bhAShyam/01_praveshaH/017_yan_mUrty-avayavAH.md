Because the six subtile components of the frame (of primordial matter) enter into (produce) these, therefore the wise ones have described the frame of that (primordial matter) as ‘body.’—(17)

‘*Frame*’—body; the ‘*components*’ of it are those things that
constitute it; these are ‘*subtile*,’ the ‘*six*’ already described
(*viz*.,the five Rudimentary Substances and the Principle of Egoism),
which are called ‘*aviśeṣa*,’ the undifferentiated. —*Tāni
āśrayanti*—*i.e*., the organs and the elemental substances going to be
described ‘enter into’ the said components; which means that they are
evolved out of them; *i.e*., the evolution of the organs &c., has for
its substratum the six subtile components; this is what has been
described in the words ‘the five elemental substances are produced out
of the five Rudimentary Substances’ (*Sāṅkhya-Kārikā*, 22). Because they
enter into them, therefore the ‘frame of that,’ *i.e*., of Primordial
Matter,—has been described as ‘Body.’

*Manasviṇaḥ*, ‘*maṇīṣā*’ is *wisdom*; those possessed of wisdom are
‘*manasvins*,’ *i.e*., *the wise ones*.

\[The above explanation makes ‘*tainīmāni*,’ the organs and substances,
the nominative, and the ‘components’ the objective;—this construction is
found to be incompatible with the nominative ending in ‘*avayavāḥ*,’
‘*components*’; hence the *Bhāṣya* puts forward another construction,
which has been adopted in the rendering of the text.\]—Or, the relation
of the ‘nominative’ and ‘objective’ may be reversed: the ‘subtile
components’ being the nominative, and the ‘organs’ the objective (of the
verb ‘*āśrayanti*,’); the meaning of ‘*āśrayanti*,’ ‘enter into,’ being
that the subtile components serve as the *substratum*—‘*āśraya*’—of the
organs; just as in the phrase ‘he has been fed (upon) by many men,’ the
man doing the *feeding* is spoken of as ‘fed.’—Or, since verbal roots
may have several meanings, ‘*enter in*’ may be explained as
‘produce.’—(17)

Nandana explains the verse to mean that ‘the body of *Hiraṇyagarbha* is
called *Śarīra*, body, because it enters all things mentioned in the
preceding verses by means of its portions’; according to Medhātithi on
the other hand, it means that—the body of *Pradhāna* is called *Śarīra*,
because its six components enter into these things,—*viz*., the organs
and the elemental substances. Kullūka refers it to the body of Brahman.

The only important points of difference are—(1) while Medhātithi takes
it as referring to the body of Pradhāna, others take it as refering to
that of Hiraṇyagarbha or Brahmā; and (2) while according to Medhātithi
the evolutes entering into that Body are the organs and the gross
elemental subtances, according to Nandana, they are only the six
principles named in verses 14-15.

The natural construction of the verse appears to be *yat (yasmāt
kāraṇāṭ) sūr?yacayacāḥ sūkṣmāḥ tāni imāni ṣaṭ āśrayanti tasmāt*——as set
forth by Medhātithi But if *tāni imāni* refers to *indriyāṇi* then there
should be an accusative ending in in order to make it the object of
*āśrayanti*. It is in view of this difficulty that the Bhāṣya has put
forward *another* construction by which *sūkṣmāḥ* is the nominative and
*tānīmāni* the objective of the verb *āśrayanti*,

017	Because those six (kinds of) minute particles, which form the (creator's) frame, enter (a-sri) these (creatures), therefore the wise call his frame sarira, (the body.)
