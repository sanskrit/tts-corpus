‘*That Supreme Lord*,’ Brahmā,—‘*for a year*,’ during a year,—‘*having
dwelt in that egg*,’—the omniscient one, who had come into existence and
was seated in the egg, thought of the way in which he would come out of
it;—‘*he broke the egg into two parts*’;—one year is the time which the
embryo takes for its development; so that after a year the egg, having
reached its full development, burst (really), by reason of its full
development having been reached. It is thus a chance coincidence that
the egg burst just at the time that Brahmā was thinking of coming out;
and it is in view of this coincidence that he is described as having
*broken the egg into two parts*.—(12)

*Parivatsaram*—Kullū. alone takes this to mean ‘a year of Brahmā’; all
others take it in the sense of the ordinary year; *Cf*. [Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa 11. 1. 6.
2](/hinduism/book/the-%C5%9Batapatha-br%C4%81hma%E1%B9%87a-part-v/d/doc63422.html "On the golden egg").

*Dhyānāt*—Medhātithi’s robust intellect again asserts itself: The Egg
broke, not because the indwelling Brahmā willed it, hut because of its
full *development*; and this coincided with Brahma’s wish to come out.
