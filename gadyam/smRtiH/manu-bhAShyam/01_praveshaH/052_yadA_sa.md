When that divine being is awake, then this world is active; when he slumbers, with his mind in calm repose, then all vanishes.—(52)

‘*When that Divine Being is awake*—*i*. *e*., when he wills, that ‘this
world may come into being and may continue to exist for such a
time,’—‘*then this world is active*’; that is, it becomes accompanied by
such internal activities as mental, verbal and material, and such
external activities as inspiration, respiration, eating, walking,
cultivation, sacrifice and so forth.

‘*When he slumbers*’—when his will desists from the creation and
maintaining of the world,—‘*then* *all vanishes*,’ undergoes absorption.

‘Waking’ and ‘sleeping’ here stand respectively for the *prevalence* and
*cessation* of his will.

‘*With his mind in calm repose*’—means that he has withdrawn from his
state of diversity.—(52)

052	When that divine one wakes, then this world stirs; when he slumbers tranquilly, then the universe sinks to sleep.
