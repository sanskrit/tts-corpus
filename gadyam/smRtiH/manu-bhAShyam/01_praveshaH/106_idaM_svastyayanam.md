‘*Svasti*,’ ‘*Welfare*’—is the non-hindrance (fulfilment) of what is
desired; ‘*dyana*’ ‘*conducive*,’ is that which brings about; hence
‘*svastyayana*,’ ‘*conducive to welfare*,’ means that which brings about
the fulfilment of what is desired.

‘*Most excellent*’—in comparison to such acts as the telling of beads,
pouring of libations and so forth; without this treatise the performance
of such acts is not possible; hence as leading to their performance, it
is described as ‘*most important*.’ Or, it may mean that the words and
sentences that serve to bring about the knowledge of virtue are
*excellent*; while the actual performance is painful; hence the former
are spoken of as ‘*most excellent*.’

‘*It expands the intellect*’—when the treatise is duly studied, its
subject-matter becomes illuminated, and the hard knots become untied;
hence follows the *expansion of the understanding*, as is well known.

‘*it brings fame*,’—when a man knows Dharma his opinion is sought for by
enquirers, and thus he acquires fame. The term ‘*Yaśasyam*’ means *that
which is the cause of fame*’, ‘*fame*’ consists in being known as
possessing the qualities of learning, nobility and so forth.

‘*The highest good*’—It brings about the due knowledge of Actions and
Wisdom, which lead to the attainment of bliss unalloyed with pain, such
bliss appearing in the form of ‘Heaven’ and ‘Final Release’; and for
this reason this treatise constitutes the ‘*highest*,’ most excellent,
‘*good*’—(106).
