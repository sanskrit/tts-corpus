Among beings, aminated ones are regarded as foremost; among aminated ones, those that subsist by reason: among rational beings men are foremost; and among men, Brāhmaṇas. (96).

The word ‘being’ stands for all such things on earth as Trees and other
immovable things, and also such movable

things as insects, beetles and the like.—Among these, the ‘*animated
ones*’—*i.e*., those that are capable of such activities as eating,
moving and so forth,—are ‘*foremost*’; being aminated, they experience
more powerful pleasures.—Among these latter, ‘*those that subsist by
reason*,’—*i.e*., those that discriminate between wholesome and
unwholesome, such for instance, as dogs, jackals and other animals \[are
foremost\]; these animals, when suffering from heat, more into the
shade; when suffering from cold, they betake themselves to the sun; they
give up a place where they find no food.—Among these latter again, ‘*men
are foremost*’; and of them, ‘*Brāhmaṇas*.’ They are the most highly
honoured; they are never ill treated by any person; in fact the killing
of the Brāhmaṇa involves a serious expiatory rite, which is due entirely
to considerations of caste. (96).
