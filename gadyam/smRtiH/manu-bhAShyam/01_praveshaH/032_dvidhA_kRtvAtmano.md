एषा सृष्टिः साक्षात् परस्य पुरुषस्य । इयं तु ब्रह्मणस् तस्यैवेत्य् अन्ये । यत् तद् अन्तरण्डं समुद्गतं शरीरं तद् द्विधा कृत्वा, **अर्धेन पुरुषो ऽभवत्** पुमान् संपन्नः शुक्रसेकसमर्थः । **अर्धेन नारी** गौरीश्वरभङ्ग्या । अथ वा पृथग् एव तां निर्मितवान् । तां निर्माय तस्यां मैथुनेन धर्मेण **विराड्** इति यस्य नाम प्रसिद्धं तं जनितवान् । एतद् उच्यते । प्रजापतिः स्वां दुहितरम् अगच्छत् । इदम् अपि जायापत्योः शरीरमात्रभेदात् सर्वत्र कार्येष्व् अविभागात् तदालम्बनं द्वैधंकारवचनम् ॥ १.३२ ॥

The creation described here is apparently of another Being; but others
have held that it is of the same *Brahmā*; the meaning being that the
body that came out of the Egg being divided into two halves, ‘*with one
half he became Male*’—*i.e*., he became a male being, capable of
instilling semen—and ‘*with the other half he became the Female*’; that
is, his body assumed the form of the Hermaphrodite, like *Gaurī-Śaṅkara*
(combined in a single body). Or, it may mean that he crested the Female
apart (from the Male).—Having created her, he produced, from her, by the
act of procreation, that being whose well-known name is ‘*Virāj*.’ What
is meant is that Prajāpati had recourse to his own daughter.

This mention of the bifurcation of Prajāpati’s body is based upon the
fact that the husband and wife differ only in their bodies, and in all
functions they are entirely united.—(32)

The ‘Virāṭ’ whose birth is here described is, according to some, the
same as,—and according to others, different from—the ‘Brahmā’ described
above, in verse 9. That Medhātithi leans towards the latter view is
indicated by his assertion that what happened was that ‘the body of
Brahmā (described in verse 9) now took the form of the
Hermaphrodite,’—or as he adds later, ‘the Female form was separated from
His own Male form.’
