असंतुष्टस्य प्रतिग्रहादिषु पुनः प्रवृत्तौ दुष्कृतिताम् आशङ्क्य समाधत्ते । **सर्वम् इदं** त्रैलोक्यान्तर्वर्ति धनं **ब्राह्मणस्य स्वं** । नात्र प्रतिग्रहो विद्यते । प्रभुत्वेनासौ गृह्णाति, न प्रतिग्रहीतृतयेति । प्रशंसैषा, न विधिः । अत एव्**आर्हति**शब्दः । **अभिजनः** अभिजातताविशिष्टत्वम् ॥ १.१०० ॥

Having raised the question that, if the Brāhmaṇa happen to be
discontented and should again undertake to receive gifts, he would incur
sin,—the Author offers his answer to it in this verse.

‘*All this*’—*i.e.*, whatever wealth exists in the three worlds—‘*is the
property of the Brāhmaṇa*’; so that for him there can he no ‘acceptance
of gifts’; what he takes possession of, he does by virtue of his being
its possessor, and not as the receiver of a gift.

This is mere praise, not an injunction; hence we have the word
‘*deserves*’.

‘*Noble birth*’—high hirth, superior character. (100). VERSE CI.

100	Whatever exists in the world is, the property of the Brahmana; on account of the excellence of his origin The Brahmana is, indeed, entitled to all.
