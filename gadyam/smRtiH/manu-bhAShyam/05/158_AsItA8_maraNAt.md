Till her death, she should remain patient, self-controlled and chaste,—seeking that most excellent merit that accrues to women having a single husband. (156).

What has gone before is further explained.

‘*Till her death she should remain chaste*’;—*i.e*., even under the said
distressing conditions she shall not seek to maintain herself by
misbehaviour.

‘*Patient*’—disregarding the troubles caused by her circumstances, she
shall not allow her chastity to be disfigured by hunger; she shall not
allow her mind to be disturbed by the waves of passion.

The compound ‘*ekapatni* (*ekapatnī*?)’ may be expounded either as
‘those who have a single husband,’ or ‘those who are wives of single
men’; such women, as Sāvitrī and the rest;—the ‘merits’ accruing to such
women; which brings such results as the capacity to confer boons and
pronounce curses;—‘*seeking*’ such merit, the woman should not renounce
chastity.

Under the said circumstances, if, by living upon fruits and roots, she
happen to die,—there would be nothing wrong in this.—(156).
