‘*Exudation from trees*’;—anything, apart from the constituent parts of
the tree itself,—such as, the root, the trunk, the branches, the leaves,
the fruits and the flowers,—which proceeds from the tree, either in the
form of some liquid flowing from the cavity in the tree, or in some
other form. The epithet ‘red’ excludes, from prohibition, such
exudations as the camphor and the like.

Those that have their origin, source, in ‘*incisions*’; those that flow
from the bark and such parts of the tree. These things, if not red, are
not forbidden.

‘*Śelu*’—the *śleṣmātaka* fruit, to be known from medical and other
treatises. It should not be taken to mean the cream of fresh milk; as it
is never known to have that meaning. It has been argued that—“it is
better to take the word as standing for *cream*, on account of its
proximity to the term, ‘curdled milk’”. But *proximity* becomes a means
of deciding in favour of one of the two possible meanings of a term,
only when the term is actually found in usage to be used in both senses;
but it can never be the authority for attributing an unheard of meaning
to a word.

‘*Of the cow*’;—this shows that that of the buffalo etc. is not
forbidden. The milk is unfit to be eaten if, by mere contact with fire,
it becomes ‘*curdled*’,—*i.e*., thickened without adhesion; the term
‘*pīyūṣa*’ is used in the sense of the milk of the newly-calved cow.

“The text is going to declare, as *until to be eaten*, the milk, along
with all its preparations, of the cow for the first ten days of its
calving; and it is only during three or four days that the milk is of
the nature described above (*i.e*., curdled by mere contact with fire)
\[so that no separate prohibition appears to be called for.\]”

True; the thing is mentioned in the present verse with a view to those
cases where the milk continues to be so ‘curdled’ even after the first
ten days.

The two words—‘*carefully*’ and ‘*avoid?*—are added only for filling up
the metre; since ‘*unfit to be eaten*’ (of verse 5) continues to be
connected with all that is mentioned in the text.—(6)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 247);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.171),
which notes that the addition of the epithet ‘red’ makes it clear that
the prohibition does not apply to such exudations as assafœtida, camphor
and the like;—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 711), which adds—‘the
red exudations’ meant are the *lac* and the rest,—the epithet ‘red’
indicating that such exudations as are white, *e.g*., assafœtida,
camphor and the like—are not forbidden,—‘*śelu*’ is
*śleṣmātaka*,—‘*peyūṣa*’ is ‘new milk,’ *i.e*., the milk of the
newly-delivered cow, whose blood-flow has not ceased; and in support it
quotes verse 8 following.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 510), which adds the
following notes—‘*Vṛkṣaniryāsa*’ is ‘the solidified exudation from
trees’,—‘*Vraścana*’ is cutting, and the exudations from cuttings are to
be avoided even when they are *not red*. The prohibition does not apply
to such things as assafœtida, camphor and the like,—‘*śelu*’ is
*śleṣmātaka*,—and ‘*peyūṣa*’ is the milk of the newly dilivered cow,
which solidifies at the slightest contact with fire;—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 567);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 287).
