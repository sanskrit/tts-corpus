‘*Unclean things*’.— Those just mentioned are to be understood as meant
here, because of their proximity.

Those *mantras* that are addressed to the Sun are called ‘*Solar*’ and
the mantras meant are ‘*udutyam jātavedasam*, &c. &c.’

The *Pāvamānī verses*.—*The* verses ‘*svādiṣṭaye*, &c. &c.’ occurring in
the ninth *maṇḍala* of the Ṛgveda.

‘*According to his inclination*’ and ‘*according to his capacity*’ mean
the same thing; two words have been used for the purposes of metre.

In as much as the ‘mantras’ and ‘verses’ are mentioned in the plural, at
least three verses should be recited; and as regards more, they may be
recited only if other and more important duties do not suffer thereby.
Then again, since the text speaks of ‘*mantras* and the term
‘*Pāramānī*’ also refers to *verses*, purification is brought about as
soon as one has gone beyond three verses, even though the hymn may not
be completed.

The *dog* also has to be included among the ‘*unclean things*’; as it
also is *unclean*. In the present context Gautama has declared—‘Of the
dog also; whatever it might pollute, say some’ (14.29-30).

‘*Attentively*’;—without allowing his mind to wander about; he should
fix it upon contemplating the deity. Or, ‘*Prayataḥ*’ may mean that ‘at
a time when one is busy with worshipping deities, if he should happen to
touch an unclean thing, he should do what is here laid down,—and not
otherwise’.—(85).

(Verse 86 of others.)

Kullūka and others take the verse as referring to the case where a man
happens to see an unclean thing after having done *ācamana* (preparatory
to some religious act).—Medhātithi and Govindarāja take it as referring
to the case already noted in the foregoing verse,—*i.e*., the meaning
being that ‘whenever one happens to *see* any of the unclean things just
enumerated, he shall do *ācamana* and then recite the verses
prescribed.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1198);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 796).

*Baudhāyana* (1.15.31).—‘If he has looked at any unclean substance, he
mutters the verse—“Unrestrained is the internal organ, wretched the
eye-sight, the sun is the chief of the lights; O *Dīkṣā*, do not forsake
me!”’

*Āpastamba* (Aparārka, p. 1197).—‘On seeing in the evening a *Caṇḍāla*
or an outcast, a woman in her courses or unclean things, he should look
at the rising sun.’

*Bodhāyana* (Aparārka, p. 1200).—‘On seeing the *Caṇḍāla*, one should
look at the stars; on talking to him, one should converse with the
Brāhmaṇa; on touching him, he shall bathe.’
