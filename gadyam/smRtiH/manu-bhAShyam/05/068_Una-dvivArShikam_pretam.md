The child whose sacramental rites have not been performed, and since
whose birth less than two years have elapsed, is called ‘*less than two
years old*’. Such a child, when it dies, ‘*the relations should place
outside*’—the village —‘*under the ground*,’ that has been dug out.

Another *Smṛti* -text contains the word ‘*nikhavet* (?)’. should bury’.

‘*Having decked*’—with ornaments befitting the dead. The ‘*decking*’,
mentioned here in connection with the child ‘few *than two years old*’,
should be understood, on the strength of usage, to apply to those also
whose sacramental rites have been performed.

‘*Clean*’—where there are no bones. That is, the ground that is clean by
reason of the absence of heaps of bones,—under such a ground should the
child he placed. As a rule, the crematorium abounds in heaps of bones;
hence what the present text means is that the child should be buried in
a place other than the crematorium; and it does not mean that in this
case the rite of ‘bone-collecting’ shall not be performed: because this
later fact is already implied by the absence of burning in the
case.—(67)

(Verse 68 of other commentators.)

‘*Asthisañcayanādṛte*’—‘Place free from bones’ (Medhātithi, also
Mitākṣarā);—‘without the rite of bonecollecting’ (Kullūka, who quotes
Viśvarupa’s explanation which agrees with Medhātithi’s).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 271), which says that this
refers to the case of the death of a child who has had his tonsure
performed during the first year;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.2) which explains
the meaning to be that ‘the child should be decked with garlands and
sandal-paint and should be buried in a clean place, away from the
burning grounds, hut outside the village,—which should he free from
bones.

It is quoted in *Hāralatā* (p. 121), which has the following
notes:—‘*ūnadvivārṣikam*’, one whose tonsure has not been performed
,—‘*alaṅkṛtya*’, having endowed the dead body with rings, clothes,
flowers, garlands and so forth, they should bury it in some pure spot
outside the village; and even though the body would soon become
decomposed and hence the rite of *picking of the, bones* might he
possible, it should not be done.
