‘*Ālabhya*’ means *touching*.

(Verse 87 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 924), which notes that what is
meant is the combination of all the three—(1) *ācamana*, (2) touching of
the cow, and (3) looking at the sun; and that this pertains to the case
of touching the bone *unintentionally*; for intentional touching, there
is impurity for three days (when fat is adhering to the bone), and one
day (when the bone is dry).

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.30), which remarks that this refers to
the bone of a twice-born person;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 293), which,
explains ‘*ālabhya*’ as ‘having touched,’ and adds that this refers to
the *unintentional* touching of the bone;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 257),
which adds that ‘this refers to twice-born persons’;—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 214);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 796);—in *Śuddhikaumudī*,
(p. 329), which explains ‘*ālabhya*’ as ‘having touched’;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika, p. 16b);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 485),
which says that this refers to cases of unintentional touching
