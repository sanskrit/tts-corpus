For this child no sanctification by fire shall be performed; nor shall water-offering he made to it; having left it like a log of wood, in the forest, one shall keep aloof for three days.—(68)

‘*Like a log of wood*;’—this signifies absence of attachment,
indifference.

The morning is that in thin case no *Śrāddha*, nor any water, is to be
offered; the prohibition of ‘water-offering’ implying that of the
*Śrāddha* also, through the relation of whole and part. It is thus that
we have to get at the omission of *Śrāddha*, which is in accordance with
usage.

Others explain this to mean the prohibition of burial laid down in other
*Smṛti* -texts. And in this case there would be option.

‘*Keep aloof*’—abstain from all religious acts prescribed in the
scriptures.—(68)

(Verse 69 of other commentators).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.2), which explains ‘*araṇye
kāṣṭhavat tyaktvā*’ as follows:—‘Just as on throwing a log of wood in
the forest, people take no notice of it, so having buried the child,
they should take no further notice of him, in the way of performing his
*Śrāddha* and other after-death rites.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 870), which explains the meaning to he
that, the child less than two years old, *which has not had its
Tonsure*, should be either buried or thrown into the water, without any
after-death rites;—and again on p. 911, where it is said that the
digging &c. are meant for the child who has had his Tonsure done during
the first year. It is difficult to reconcile the two statements.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 271), which also says that, these
two verses refer to the case of the child who has had his Tonsure
performed during the first year;—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 122), which
explains ‘*araṇye*,’ ‘in forest,’ as meaning in ‘uncultivated ground,’
and ‘*Kāṣṭhavat*’ as implying that they should not grieve over it;—and
in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 6).
