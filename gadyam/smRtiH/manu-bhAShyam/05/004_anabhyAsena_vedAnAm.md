Bhṛgu, the righteous son of Manu, said to the great sages—“Listen, by what fault Death seeks to destroy the Brāhmaṇas.”—(3).


Death seeks to destroy the Brāhmaṇas on account of their omitting the study of the Vedas, on account of neglect of right conduct, on account of slothfulness and on account of the defects of food.—(4).

*Objection*—“When the question has been put forward in regard to
Brāhmaṇas *who perform their duties*, it is not right to answer it by
indicating the ‘fault’; nor can there be any connection with what
follows (in verse 4) \[as omission of Vedic Study &c. is not possible
for those who perform their duties\].”

The answer to the above is as follows:—‘Omission of Vedic Study’ and the
rest have been put forward only by way of illustration; the sense
being—‘just as the omission of Vedic Study and the rest are acknowledged
by you all to be the causes of death, so also are the defects of food,
going to be described below. Even when a man carries on Vedic Study &c.,
the fulfilment of his above-described duty is not complete, if it is
beset with the very much more serious drawback of defective food. This
is emphasised here in view of the fact that this is an entirely
different section (dealing with defects of food). (3-4)

**(verse 5.4)  
**

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 8) to the
effect that laziness also is the source of a ‘force’ that brings about
untimely death;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 510), which explains
‘*ālasya*’ as ‘not being disposed to perform one’s duty, even when he is
able to do it’;—‘*annadoṣa*’ as standing for defective production and so
forth;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 294.)

**(verse 5.4)  
**

*Yājñavalkya* (Parāśaramādhava, Prāyaścitta, p. 6).—‘By omitting to do
what is enjoined and by doing what is forbidden, and by not controlling
the senses, doth a man fall into degradation.’

004	'Through neglect of the Veda-study, through deviation from the rule of conduct, through remissness (in the fulfilment of duties), and through faults (committed by eating forbidden) food, Death becomes eager to shorten the lives of Brahmanas.'
