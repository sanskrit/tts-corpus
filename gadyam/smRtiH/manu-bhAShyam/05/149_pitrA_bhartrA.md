अव्यवस्थानं वचनीयताहेतुः कथितो **गर्ह्ये कुर्याद्** इति । **एषां हि विरहेण** निवसन्ती गच्छन्ती वा ग्रामान्तरम् इत्य् अध्याहार्यम् ॥ ५.१४७ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The ground for ‘disrepute’ would consist in the irregularity of her
life; this is what is meant by the words ‘*would render both families
disreputable*.’ This passage has to be explained as ‘By living or going
about in other villages, apart from the persons mentioned, &c.,
&c.’—(147).
