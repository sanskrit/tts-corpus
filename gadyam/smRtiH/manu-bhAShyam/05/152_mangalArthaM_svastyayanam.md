At their wedding, the sacrifice to Prajāpati, which is the means of securing welfare, is performed for the purpose of procuring good fortune; it is the giving away that is the source of ownership.—(150).

‘*Good fortune*’ consists in the accomplishment of the desired object;
what brings about this is said to be ‘for that purpose;’ it is for this
that there is ‘sacrifice to Prajāpati.’ The term ‘*maṅgalārtham*’ is in
the neuter form, because it is an adverb.

‘*Svastyayanam*’ is that by which ‘*svasti*’, *welfare*—‘*īyate*’,—*is
secured*; *i.e*. whereby the person’s loved objects do not become lost.

‘*Their*’—of women.

‘*At wedding*’, ‘sacrifice’ is offered to the deity Prajāpati. This
refers to certain offerings of butter that are presented as to be made
at marriage with the *mantras ‘Prajāpate* &c.’ This is only
illustrative: it indicates the other deities also—*e.g*. Pūṣan, Varuṇa
and Aryaman. Indicative also of these other deities are such
mantra-texts as —‘*Puṣannu devam varuṇanna devam*, &c., &c.’

What, the present text, means is that even without the marriage,
ownership is produced by the *giving away*; and no significance is meant
to be attached to the statement that the marriage-sacrifices are
performed only for the purpose of securing good fortune; because
‘marriage’ has been declared to consist in the ‘taking of a wife’; and
even though there may be ownership, the girl does not become ‘wife’
until the marriage is performed.—(150).

(Verse 152 of others.)

‘*Svastyayanam*’—‘The recitation of benedictory verses’ (Govindarāja and
Kullūka);—‘the *Puṇyāhavācana* and the rest’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘the recitation
of the texts that precede the nuptial *Homa*’ (Rāghavānanda and
Nandana);—‘that whereby welfare is acquired,’ (Medhātithi who does *not*
connect the word with ‘*yajñaḥ*’).

‘*Prajāpateḥ*’—Medhātithi takes this as ‘referring to the oblations at
marriage to Prajāpati with the mantra *Prajāpate na tvadetanya &c*.’
(Ṛgveda 10.121.10), laid down in certain Gṛhyasūtras;—Nārāyaṇa holds
that ‘*Prajāpatī*’ here stands for Manu, who is the guardian deity of
the bride.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 853),.which adds
the following notes:—‘*Svastyayana*’ means ‘the request to Brāhmaṇas for
the pronouncing of the benedictory syllable
*svasti*,’—‘*Prajāpati-yajña* means ‘the offering of cooked rice into
fire to Prajāpati’;—and in *Vyavahāra Bālambhaṭṭi* (p. 529).

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (p. 130) which adds the following
notes:—‘*Svastyayanam*’ stands for the wearing of gold for the purpose
of passing a happy life, or for the request to Brāhmaṇas for pronouncing
the syllable *svasti*; and the offering ‘to Prajāpati’ is that which is
made during marriage to Prajāpati as the deity;—the ‘*svāmyakāraṇa*’ is
the ‘giving’, the actual *giving away*, not the mere *betrothal*.

152	For the sake of procuring good fortune to (brides), the recitation of benedictory texts (svastyayana), and the sacrifice to the Lord of creatures (Pragapati) are used at weddings; (but) the betrothal (by the father or guardian) is the cause of (the husband's) dominion (over his wife).
