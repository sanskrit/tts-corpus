The Text now shows what the great Sages asked.

‘*Thus*’—refers to the *manner* in which the Treatise has propounded the
subject; and ‘*exactly as described*’—refers to the *subject-matter* of
the Treatise.

Those Twice-born men who perform the duty exactly in the form in which
it has been described in the present Treatise:—that all *twice born men*
are indicated by the terms ‘*vipra*’ ‘*brahmana*’, in the Text will be
clear from what is going to be said in verse 26 below, where
‘twice-born’ is the term used;—‘*how is it that Death orerpotrers
them*’—while still in the state of the ‘Student,’ or in that of the^(;)
Accomplished Student’? How is this, when, in reality, they should live
the full spun of humun life? The span of a man’s life is a hundred
years; so that the death of Brāhmaṇas before that is not proper;
specially as it has been declared that ‘from right conduct one attains
longevity’ (4.156), and ‘no calamity befalls persons who recite the Veda
and. offer oblations’ (4.146). (2).
