If a man performs the Aśvamedha Sacrifice every year, for a hundred tears,—and another does not eat meat,—the merit and reward of both these are the same.—(53.)

देवाद्यर्चनशिष्टस्य शशादिमांसस्य भक्षणम् अनुज्ञातम् । ततो निवर्तमानो ऽश्वमेधफलम् अश्नुते । अश्वमेधस्य फलम् "सर्वान् कामान् अवश्यं सर्वाविजितीः" इत्यादि ।

- न चात्र चोदनीयम्- कथं महाप्रयासेन बहुधनव्ययेन च तुल्यफलता मांसनिवृत्तेः स्यात् । यत एषो ऽपि संयमो ऽतिदुष्करः । किं च लोकवत् परिमाणतः फलविशेषः स्याद् इत्य् अयं न्यायो जृम्भत एव । अतः फलविधौ न दोषः ।

The eating of the meat of the Hare and other animals,—in the form of
remnants of the worship of Gods and Pitṛs—has been sanctioned. If one
abstains from this eating, he obtains the fruits of the *Aśvamedha*
sacrifice; and the fruits of this sacrifice have been described in the
words ‘he obtains all desires, etc., etc.’

In this connection it would not be right to urge the following
objection:—“How can mere abstaining from meat be equal to a sacrifice
involving tremendous labour and much expense?”—Because the said
abstention also is extremely difficult. Further, the principle
enunciated in the Sūtra.—‘The particular result would follow from
development as in the ordinary world’—is operative here also. Hence
there can be no objection against the asserting of results or fruits of
actions.

Our answer however is us follows:—What is said in the text is a purely
commendatory exaggeration; socially because the statement of the
sacrifice being performed ‘every year for one hundred years’ can be
regarded only us such an exaggeration; for it is not possible for the
*Aśvamedha* to be performed every year; nor can it be performed ‘for a
hundred years,’ as no performer would live so long,

‘*Puṇyaphalam*’ is a copulative compound, it being impossible to take it
us a Genitive *Tatpuruṣa*.—(53).

In the Mahābhārata (13.114.15) this occurs as writer’s ‘*matam mama*,’
but it has ‘*māse*’ for ‘*varṣe*’—says Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.181), to the effect that the
merit of the performance of *Aśvamedha* accrues to one who renounces
meat for a full year;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 533), which
adds that according to Medhātithi, this is mere *Arthavāda*, and not the
declaration of a result that actually follows from the act,—this being
based upon the principle laid down by Jaimini under 4.3.1. It goes on to
add that this view is not right; as this case is not analogous to that
of Jaimini 4.3.1,

A ‘declaration of rewards’ is regarded as an ‘*Arthavāda*’ only when
there is some other passage mentioning another reward in connection with
the same act; in the present case, however, we do not find any other
passage speaking of any other rewards accruing from the renouncing of
meat for one year; so that this comes under the *Rātrisattranyāya*
(Jaimini 4.3.17 *et. seq*.; see note under verse 40). It concludes with
the remark that the reward accruing from the renouncing of meat for one
year,—even though of the same kind as that following from the
*Aśvamedha*—is of a much lower *degree*;—and quotes the following
*Kārikā* of ‘Bhaṭṭapāda’—

*Mahābhārata* (13.115.10, 16).—‘If one performs the Aśvamedha month
after month, and if one eats not. meat, the two are equal. If one were
to perform difficult austerities for full one hundred years, and one
were to omit meat-eating, the two might or might not be equal.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.76).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (1.181).—(See above, under 47.)
