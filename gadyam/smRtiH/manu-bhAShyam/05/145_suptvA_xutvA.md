‘*After having sneezed*,’—after having done *sneezing*, which is the
name given to the sound that emanates involuntarily from the nostrils of
a man moved by internal wind.

‘*Even though he may be quite pure*.’—This is to be construed only with
the phrase^(‘)*when going to read the Veda*’; the meaning being that
even though he be quite pure, he should, when going to read the Veda,
read it after having sipped water; *i.e*., the water sipping-should be
done as part of the procedure laid down in connection with Vedic study;
while after *sleep* &c., the water-sipping shall be done *once* only.

As for the following declaration—^(‘)Having slept, having sneezed,
having eaten, having drunk water, the wise man shall sip water and then
again sip water; as also after having spat and told lies’,—this has to
be construed to mean that ‘having sipped water, he should eat and then
sip water again.’ In a case however where it is clearly stated that ‘one
should sip water *twice*, the act has to be repeated consecutively.’

(Verse 145 of others.)

*Cf* 2.70.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1139), which adds that the
‘water-sipping’ here laid down for lying is to be combined with the
repeating of the *Gāyatrī*—the water-sipping removing the uncleanliness
and the *Gāyatrī* removing

the sin;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.196);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 115),
which notes that though this verse clearly implies that water-sipping is
not done for the purpose of removing impurity, yet it is absolutely
necessary, whenever one eats or drinks;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
224);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 423), which says that this
refers to unintentional lying;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 523),
which adds that ‘*prayatopi*’ means ‘though he may have already
washed’;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 349), which explains
‘*Adhyeṣyamāṇaḥ*’ as ‘going to read.’
