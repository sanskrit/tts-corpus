अनुगमनं बुद्धिपूवम् अनुव्रजनम् । यथाकथंचिद् अधिगमने न च सचैलम् । स्नानम् अग्निस्पर्शो घृतप्राशनं च स्मुच्छितं शुद्धिहेतुः ॥ ५.१०२ ॥

‘*Following*’—going after, intentionally. If he happen to follow it by
chance, then he need not bathe with clothes on.

*Bathing*, *Touching of fire* and *Eating of clarified butter*,—all
these *collectively* are the means of purification.—(102).

(Verse 103 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.26), which explains ‘*jñāti*’
as ‘mother’s sapiṇḍa’;—in *Aparārka* (p. 918), which adds that this
applies to one who follows the dead body intentionally, and not to one
who happens to go with it by mere chance;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 212).

This verse is quoted in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 22), which explains
‘*jñāti*’ as ‘one belonging to the same caste,’ *not* a *sapiṇḍa*, and
adds that ‘eating of butter’ means fasting.

It is quoted in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 225), which explains ‘*jñāti*’ as
‘mother’s sapiṇḍa’;—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 332);—in *Hāralatā* (p.
86) which has the, following notes:—‘*Pretam*,’ a Brāhmaṇa dead,—if one
intentionally follows he becomes pure by touching fire and eating not
butter, this is what is meant, and *not* that the impurity ceases on
this alone, because even without following the dead body, the death of a
relative involves an impurity for ten days; the following of a
non-relative (‘ajñāti’) however involves only the touching of fire and
eating of butter, and no further impurity.

*Gautama* (14.31).—‘If he has followed a corpse, he shall purify himself
by bathing in his clothes.’

*Viṣṇu* (22.64).—‘If he has followed the corpse of a twice-born person,
he must go to a river and having plunged into it, repeat the
*Aghamarṣaṇa mantra* three times, and then coming out of the water,
repeat the *Gāyatrī*, a hundred and eight times.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.26).—‘If the Brāhmaṇa has followed the corpse of a
twice-born person or a Śūdra, he shall become pure by bathing in water,
touching fire and eating clarified butter.’

*Parāśara* (3.42-46).—‘(Same as Manu 102, then)—If the Brāhmaṇa, through
folly, follows the corpse of a Kṣatriya, he remains impure for one day
and becomes purified by eating *Pañcagavya*,—If a Brāhmaṇa, through
folly, follows a dead Vaiśya, he remains impure for two nights and after
that he should perform six breath-suspensions. If a foolish Brāhmaṇa
follow a dead Śūdra, he shall remain impure for three nights and after
the lapse of the third night, he shall go to a river that falls into the
ocean and having performed a hundred breath-suspensions, and eaten
clarified butter, he shall become purified.’

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 636).—‘In the case of a Kṣatriya
corpse being followed, purification comes after one day; in that of a
Vaiśya one, after two days; and in that of a Śūdra one, after three
days, followed by a hundred breath-suspensions.’
