This refers to the Brāhmaṇa who is in the habit of eating at the house
of those *Śūdra* whose food he is permitted to eat.

It is possible that at the house of a *Śūdra*, there may he some
articles of food that are not fit to be eaten by the Brāhmaṇa, which can
not always be avoided; if the Brāhmaṇa eats at the house of such a
*Śūdra*, there is always a fear of his having partaken of some forbidden
food; hence for him it is laid down that he should perforin the
‘*Prājāpatya Kṛcchra*’. In all bases where the precise form of the
‘*kṛcchra*’ is not laid down, it should be understood to be
the^(‘)Prājāpatya’ *kṛcchra* as we shall explain later on.

^(‘)*In order to* *atone* *for unintentional eating*’:—*i.e*., in the
event of there being suspicion of his having unwillingly partaken of
forbidden food; that is, for the expiating of the sin incurred, in the
event of his having eaten forbidden food.

“But the expiation for this is going to be prescribed later on, under
5.I27.”

What that means and refers to we shall explain in connection with that
verse.

For the art committed intentionally, special rites should be performed;
*i.e*. that expiatory rite which has been prescribed in many words in
connection with a particular case—(21).
