‘*Like a log of wood*;’—this signifies absence of attachment,
indifference.

The morning is that in thin case no *Śrāddha*, nor any water, is to be
offered; the prohibition of ‘water-offering’ implying that of the
*Śrāddha* also, through the relation of whole and part. It is thus that
we have to get at the omission of *Śrāddha*, which is in accordance with
usage.

Others explain this to mean the prohibition of burial laid down in other
*Smṛti* -texts. And in this case there would be option.

‘*Keep aloof*’—abstain from all religious acts prescribed in the
scriptures.—(68)

‘*Upto three years of age*’;—this prohibition applies till the end of
the third year; and not from the fourth year upwards. It is in this
sense that some people read an ‘*ādi*’, the line being read
as—‘*trivarṣādeva kartavyā*’. Such also is the ordinary usage.

‘*For one whose teeth had appeared it may be done optionally*.’—By
association with the ‘water-offering’, *burning by fire* also becomes
permitted.

Objection—“When there is *option*, one may do what he likes; under the
circumstances, who would ever have recourse to that alternative which
involves much effort and expenditure of wealth? Thus then, the laying
down of such a course of action is absolutely useless.”

The answer to this is as follows:—What is mentioned here is for the
parents, as distinguished from all other persons; the offerings that are
made are for the benefit of the deceased; and bring of the nature of an
‘occasional duty,’ it is one that must be done, as we have explained
before. So that the option mentioned in the present verse is dearly
understood as containing, on the one hand, the prohibition of a
necessary duty; while, on the other, it permits its performance on the
ground of its being beneficial to the deceased. So that if one omits the
act, it does not involve the transgression of an injunction: while by
performing it, one confers a benefit upon the deceased; so that there is
no incompatibility between the Injunction and the Prohibition.—(69)
