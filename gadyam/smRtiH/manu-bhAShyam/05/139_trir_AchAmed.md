This is the reiteration (of a former injunction), for the purpose of
enjoining what is necessary for the woman and the *Śūdra*. Though what
is said here has been already declared before, yet it is repeated here
for the sake of women and *Śūdras*.

Some people explain this text as follows:—According to the rule that
‘the Śūdra is purified by touching water’, all that the ordinary Śūdra
is to do is to touch water; hence washing and touching of the ear, etc.,
that are understood as applying to the

*Śūdra*, are regarded as pertaining to the better class of *Śūdras*. As
regards women,—the general rule being that ‘the Brāhmaṇa is purified by
water reaching the heart &c., &c.’ (2. 62), where the different castes
are specified, it would seem as if all that is prescribed for males is
to be done by females also; and it is with a view to preclude this
notion that we have the present text.

‘*Desiring bodily purification*’;—this indicates that if one is quite
clean when going to read or to take food, he need not necessarily repeat
the acts *thrice*; nor need there be *washing*;—*all* that need be done
is the sipping of some quantity of water, and the touching of the
organs; and not all the details that have been laid down in connection
with the ‘sipping of water’ prescribed among the duties of the
Student.—(137).

(Verse 139 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 40);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
53),—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 992) which explains ‘*mukham*’ as
‘lips.’
