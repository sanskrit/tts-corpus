‘*Of various things*;’—*i.e*., of substances that are used by man, in
the form of products that are igneous, earthy, liquid, solid, isolated,
compact.

This verse points out the difference of what is going to be described
from the purification described above. In the foregoing Section the most
important purification was shown to be that of the Soul, that of
substances deserving attention only because of their being used by the
personality; while in the present section the reverse is the case.

‘*Listen to the rule*’.—This verse is meant to avoid the two sections
being comfounded.—(109).
