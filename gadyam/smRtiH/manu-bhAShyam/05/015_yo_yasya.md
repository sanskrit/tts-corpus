He who eats the flesh of an animal, is called the ‘eater of its flesh’; he who eats fish is the ‘eater of all kinds of flesh’; hence one shall avoid fish.—(15).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is a commendatory supplement to the foregoing prohibition of fish.

When one eats the flesh of an animal, he comes to be described as
connected with the act of eating that animal; *e.g*., the mungoose is
called ‘serpent-eater’, the cat ‘rat-eater’ and so forth. He who eats
fish eats all kinds of flesh; it would be right to speak of him as a
‘beef-eater’ also.

Hence, by reason of the possibility of this calumny, one should avoid
fish.—(15).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 546), which adds
that this is an *arthavāda* to the prohibition of eating fish that has
gone before in the preceding verse;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 448);—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 299).
