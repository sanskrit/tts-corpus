तावतीर् जन्मनाम् आवृत्तीर् **मारणं प्राप्नोति** । **वृथापशुघ्नः** श्रुतिस्मृत्योर् अचोदितं पशुवधं यः करोति । तच् च प्रकरणान् महानवम्यादिषु लौकिकैर् यत् क्रियते । पशुघ्न इति कप्रत्यये छान्दसं रूपम् ॥ ५.३८ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

For so many lives does he suffer violent death.

‘*Needless killer of the animal*’,—one who kills the animal in a way not
prescribed in the *Śruti* or the *Smṛti*: from the context it is clear
that this refers to that animal-sacrifice which ordinary people perforin
on the Mahānavamī.

The term ‘*paśaghna* (?)’ is a Vedic form formed with the affix
‘*ka*’—(38).
