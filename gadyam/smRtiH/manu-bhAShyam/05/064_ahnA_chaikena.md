‘*Three three-day periods*’— *i.e*., nine days;—along with one day and
one night,—make up *ten days*. The period has been mentioned in this
fashion in view of metrical exigencies.

‘*Those who touch the corpse*’—*i.e*., those who wash and adorn the dead
body. Mere bathing is going to be laid down later on, for the other
persons touching the body, as also for those who carry it; as will be
made dear from the next verse.

All this refers to the *Samānodaka* relations as also to those who carry
the body for wages received. In regard to the carrying of the dead of
helpless and forlorn persons, we have another *Smṛti*—text, which
says—‘For such persons who do the excellent deed (of carrying the dead
body of a helpless man), there is nothing wrong, nor is there any
impurity involved, for them it has been ordained that they are
immediately purified by bathing in water.’ As regards the assertion of
the text under 5.100—‘He who carries the dead body of a Brāhmaṇa, who is
not his Sapiṇḍa-relation, becomes purified in three days’—what this
means we shall explain under that verse.

‘*Those who offer water*’— *i.e*., the ‘*Samānodaka*’ relations. In
connection with these, ‘immediate purification’ also is going to be laid
down under verse 77. Hence the two should be regarded as optional
alternatives.

What is said here is in connection with ‘sapiṇḍa’ relations and refers
to persons not engaged in Vedic study.—(63)

(Verse 64 of other commentators.)

“According to Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa, the rule refers to such
Brāhmaṇas who for money carry a dead body to the cemetery according to
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda, to Sapiṇḍas who in any way touch a corpse out
of affection;—Medhātithi thinks that it applies to all who touch or cany
out a dead body, be it for love or for money. Rāghavānanda thinks that
the text mentions three alternative periods of impurity, one day, three
days and ten days.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 883), which explains it as
laying down the period of impurity of ten days for those who touch a
dead body; it explains ‘*ahnā chaikena rātryā*’ as meaning ‘one day and
night,’ and ‘*tribhiḥ trirātraiḥ*’ as ‘nine days’;—thus ten days is the
period of impurity (for the Brāhmaṇa) touching the dead body of the
Brāhmaṇa; for the Brāhmaṇa carrying for money the dead body of other
castes, the period extends to that which has been prescribed for that
caste—says the *Viṣṇupurāṇa*;—*Aparārka* quotes the verse again on p.
893 to the effect that the period of impurity, for *Samānodakas* is only
three days.

It is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 382), which also explains it as
laying down a period of ten days.

*Gautama* (14.23.10, 27).—‘On touching a corpse from an interested
motive, the impurity lasts for ten days. The duration of the impurity of
a Vaiśya and of a Śūdra (in the same case), twelve days, or half a
month, or a whole month, or as many days as there are seasons in the
year: The same rule applies to the higher castes. Or the impurity-lasts
three days.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.11).—‘For those who have touched a corpse as a duty,
and who desire immediate purification, such purification is accomplished
by Bathing and Breath-control.’

*Parāśara* (Mitākṣara, 3, 14).—‘Those twice-born persons who carry the
dead body of a Brāhmaṇa become purified immediately by bathing.’

*Viṣṇupurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 883).—‘If a man, on payment, burns the dead
body of a person of a different caste from himself, the period of his
impurity will be the same as that prescribed for the caste of the dead.’

*Parāśara* (Aparārka, p. 883).—‘The Brāhmaṇa is not defiled by touching
or cremating a dead body: if he carries it and applies fire to it, he
becomes purified immediately by bathing.’

*Hārīta* (Do.).—‘Those who have touched the corpse shall not enter the
village till the stars become visible; and at night, till the appearance
of the sun.’
