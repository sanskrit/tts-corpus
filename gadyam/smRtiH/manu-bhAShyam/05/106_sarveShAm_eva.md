Among all modes of purification, purity in regard to wealth has been ordained to be the most important; for he who is pure in regard to wealth is really pure, and he is not pure who is merely purified by clay and water.—(105).

“What is the connection of this in the present context?”

What is meant is that—‘just as one who, after having paid the of nature,
immediately betakes to purifying himself by day and water,—so whenever,
through carelessness and mistake, one happens to steal what belongs to
others, or to do any such act,—he should immediately betake to the
necessary expiatory rites, for the purpose of purifying himself’;—as is
going to be explained under Discourse 11.—(105).

106	Among all modes of purification, purity in (the acquisition of) wealth is declared to be the best; for he is pure who gains wealth with clean hands, not he who purifies himself with earth and water.
