‘*Uṣa*’ is *saline earth*.

The ‘*soap-berry*’ and other things mentioned are well-known.

When the stuffs spoken of are stained by an oily substance, they have to
be rubbed over with the powder of the things mentioned, and then washed.

‘*Silken-stuff*’, ‘*kauśeya*’, is a particular kind of doth; so also the
‘*aṃśu-paṭṭa*’; the ‘*āvika*’, is *woolen stuff*. In connection with
this latter *Hārīta* has declared that ‘woolen articles are purified by
the sun.’ But this should be understood as pertaining to such stuffs as
are constantly worn, and hence come into contact with the bodies of
several persons; and not when they have become defiled by foreign
contamination.

By reason of all these being ‘cloth’, it might be thought that
‘sprinkling and washing’ would be the means of purifying them; and the
present text prescribes the methods for moving the stains of oil, &c.

‘*Kṣauma*’, ‘*Linen*’, includes *jute stuff* also. (119).

(Verse 120 of others.)

‘*Aṃśupaṭṭa*’—‘Cloth made of thinned bark’ (Govindarājā, Nandana and
Nārāyaṇa);—‘women’s garments made of fine cloth’ (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Prāyaścitta, p. 138), which
describes ‘*āvika*’ as ‘*kambala*, blanket’,—‘*kauśeya*’ as
‘silk’,—‘*aṃśupaṭṭa*’ as *netrapaṭa*—‘*ariṣṭa*’ as ‘the fruit of the
Putrajīva berry’,—‘*kutapa*’ as ‘a particular kind of blanket made of
the wool of goats common *in the, regions of Avantī* (Ujjain) (or var:
lec: *in mountainous regions*);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 805).
