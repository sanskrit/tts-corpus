By śūdras living according to law, shaving should be done every month; thus manner of purification should be like that of the Vaiśya; and their food shall consist of the leavings of twice-born men.—(139).

A general rule of conduct is here laid down for the better class of
*Śūdras*.

‘*Living according to law*;’—*i.e*. attending on twice-born men and
performing the great sacrifices. By these ‘*shaving*’—of the head—shall
be done ‘*every month*’. The Genitive in *Śūdrāṇām* has the sense of the
Instrumental. Or, in as much as *śūdras* are entirely dependent upon
Brāhmaṇas their shaving shall be got done by these latter; and in this
case the root ‘*kṛ*,’ which has several meanings, is to be taken in the
sense of *advising*.

The details of the manner of purification—in connection with births,
deaths and the rest—should be like those of the *Vaisḥya*.

‘*Their food shall consist of the leavings, or twice-born men*.’—This
has been already explained before.—(138).

(Verse 140 of others.)

‘*Māsikam mpanam kāryam*’ means, according to Nandana, ‘shall offer the
monthly *Śrāddha*.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 906), which adds the following
notes:—The rule of purity pertaining to the Vaiśya means a period of
impurity extending over *fifteen* days;—‘*Nyāyavartinām*’ means devoted
to the service of the twice-born, the offering of the Five Great
Sacrifices, the supporting of dependents, the loving of wife and so
forth.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 111);—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p.
318), which leads ‘*ārya*’ (for ‘Vaiśya’) and explains it as
*Vaiśya*;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 10), which has the following notes:—That
‘Śūdra’ is called *Nyāyavartin* who, with a purely religious motive,
serves the Brāhmaṇa honestly and earnestly, performs the Five Sacrifices
with ‘*namaḥ*’ as the mantra, avoids all forbidden food and forbidden
acts,—such a *Śūdra* becomes purified in *Fifteen* days, in the manner
of a Vaiśya,—he should *shave* every month,—or *vapanam* may mean
‘offering of Piṇḍas’ *i.e*., the Śrāddha on the Moonless Day,—it is only
such a Śūdra that is entitled to eat the food-leavings of the
Brāhmaṇa,—this curtailment of the period of impurity (from one month to
fifteen days) is only for the purpose of the man serving the Brāhmaṇa,
and for that of offering the Five Sacrifices and so forth,—in
*Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 573), which explains *vapanam* as shaving and
says that the Śūdra should not keep long hair,—or it may stand for the
*Amāvasyā Śrāddha*;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 352).

*Āpastamba* (2.3.5-8).—‘For Śūdras is prescribed the same rule of
sipping water as for their masters; besides the *Śūdra* cooks shall
daily have shaved the hair of their heads, of their beards, on their
bodies, and also their nails; and they shall bathe with clothes on; or
they may trim their hair and nails on the eighth day of each month, or
on the Full moon and Moonless days.’

140	Sudras who live according to the law, shall each month shave (their heads); their mode of purification (shall be) the same as that of Vaisyas, and their food the fragments of an Aryan's meal.
