*Sprinkling*—with cow’s urine or water; or by milk, as laid down in some
books.

‘*Scraping*.’—Scratching with some weapon and then throwing away the
scraped earth, according to Gautama’s direction that ‘of land there
should be throwing away’ (1.32).

‘*By these five*.’—This re-iteration is with a view to indicate that the
methods may be used singly or collectively. ‘*Smearing* without
‘*cleaning*’, is a means of purifying a spot which is not supplied with
a dust-inn. If the ground is stained with urine or ordure, there should
be *scraping* and *sweeping*. In the case of river-banks and forests,
there should be sprinkling with water.

‘*Lodging of cows*’—making the land a cow-pen for a single day.

All this should be done in the case of land lying near the
cremation-ground. In the case of land containing bones and skull, a
portion of the earth should be taken out and thrown away to another
place; also where all these may not be visible, but where their
existence and subsequent appearance may be suspected.—(122).

*Baudhāyana* (1.9.11).—‘Land becomes pure, according to the degree of
defilement, by sweeping, by sprinkling, by smearing with cow-dung, by
scattering pure earth over it, and by scraping.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.13.16-20).—‘If solid earth is defiled, it should be
smeared with cow-dung; loose earth is cleansed by ploughing;—moist earth
by bringing pure earth and covering with it; land is purified in four
ways—by being trod on by cows, by digging, by lighting fire on it and by
rain falling on it,—fifthly by smearing it with cow-dung and sixthly,
through lapse of time.’

*Gautama* (1.32).—‘Scattering earth over it is a method of purifying
land.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.56).—‘Land becomes pure according to the degree of
defilement, by sweeping, by smearing with cowdung, by scraping, by
sprinkling and by heaping earth on it.’
