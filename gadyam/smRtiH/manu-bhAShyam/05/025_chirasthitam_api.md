‘*Kept long*’—*i.e*., kept for two nights.

The term ‘*even* *though*’ implies that those ‘mixed with oils’ are also
meant to be included.

Even though unmixed with oils, such things as fried flour and cakes,
etc. as are made of barley and wheat.

Also ‘*preparations* *of milk*.’—such as curd, skimmed milk and the
like.—(25).
