(Verse 163 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 30);—and in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 452), which adds that for being called
‘*Parapūrva*’ the only necessary condition is that she should have taken
another husband; and not that this husband must be of a lower caste (as
the words of the text would seem to imply).
