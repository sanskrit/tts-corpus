(Verse 160 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.127) to the same effect as the
last two verses;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 198) to the effect that a woman
devoted to her husband need not follow him in death;—‘*Sādhvī*’ means
‘*pativratā*,’ ‘one devoted to her husband’; if it meant simply
‘chaste’, then the phrase ‘*brahmacarye vyavasthitā*’ would be a
needless repetition;—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 577);—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 67b and Vyavahāra, p. 38a).
