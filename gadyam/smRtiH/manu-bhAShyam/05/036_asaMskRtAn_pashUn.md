<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In connection with animals-sacrifice, ‘sprinkling with water’ and other
consecrations have been laid down as to be done with sacred texts; and
one shall eat the meat of those animals for whom all these have been
performed, and which (thus) are the ‘remnants of sacrifices’ prescribed
in the Vedas. But in the case of the and other sacrifices that are
performed solely on the strength of usage (and for which there is no
injunction in the Veda),—even though the meat would he the ‘remnant of
sacrifice’, yet, since there would be no ‘consecration with sacred
texts’, it would be ‘unfit for eating’.

‘*Eternal*’—Vedic.

‘*Taking his stand*’—dependent.—(36)
