The term ‘*sadā*’, like the term ‘*nitya*’, signifies *constantly*.

‘*Cheerful*’— always smiling. Even though elsewhere the might have had
reasons for anger and sorrow, yet when she sees her husband, she should
show that she is happy, by means of a cheerful face, smiles, sweet words
and so forth. This advice is meant for the married as well as the
unmarried girl.

‘*Alert in household-work*,’—*in* laying by and spending money in such
religious acts as bathing and the like. What is ‘household-work’ has
been explained in 9.11. In all that she should be ‘*alert*’, expert.
That is to say, she should be able to cook food quickly and so forth.

‘*She should have the utensils well cleaned*’— Vessels used in the
house, such as the jar, the the and so forth, are called ‘*utensils*’;
and all these should be ‘*well cleaned*’, thoroughly washed and
nice-looking.

‘*In spending*’—wealth, over the feeding of friends, relations and
guests,—‘*she should be close-fisted*’—not too liberal; that is, she
should not spend too much.

‘*Susaṃskṛtopaskaraya*’ is a *Bahuvrīhi* compound—‘she whose
*upaskaras*, utensils, are *susaṁskṛta*, ‘well-cleaned.’ Similarly
‘*mukta-hastayā*’ means ‘she whose *hasta*, fist, is *mukta*, open’; and
this is compounded with the negative particle. But apart from its
literal meaning, the word ‘*mukta-hasta*’ denotes, by convention,
*liberality*—(148).
