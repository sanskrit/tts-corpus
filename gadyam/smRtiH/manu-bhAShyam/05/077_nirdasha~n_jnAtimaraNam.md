(Verse 77 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 904), which explains ‘*nirdaśam*’
as ‘from which ten days have elapsed;’—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.21);—in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 385), in support of the view that for the Father,
there is impurity even on hearing of the birth of a son after ten days
have elapsed, though there is none for other relations;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 188);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 427) to the
same effect as *Nirṇayasindhu*;—in *Parāśramādhāva* (Ācāra, p. 600), to
the same effect;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 275) to the same effect;—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 232), which adds that the mention of ‘*putra*,’
son, makes it clear that the purification applies to the *Father*
only;—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 34) which says that ‘*nirdaśam
jñātimaraṇam*’ stands for ‘the lapsing of the period of impurity’;—and
in *Hāralatā* (p. 32), which adds this explanation:—‘If one hears of the
death of a Sapiṇḍa after the lapse of ten days, he becomes purified by
bathing with clothes on,’ and ‘on hearing of the birth of his son, after
ten days, one becomes pure by mere bathing it adds that the
‘purification meant here is only the cessation of untouchability’.
