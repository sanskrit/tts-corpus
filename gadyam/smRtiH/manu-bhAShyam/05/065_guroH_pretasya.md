**पितृमेधः** चरमेष्टिः । <u>अन्ये</u> तु सर्वं कर्मैव लक्ष्यत इति प्राहुः । तत् कुर्वन् **शिष्यो** **दशरात्रेण शुध्यति** । ब्रह्मचारिणो ऽप्य् अयं विधिर् अस्त्य् एव । **प्रेताहारैः समः** । प्रेतं हरन्ति निर्यापयन्ति तथा तेषां दशाहः । एवं शिष्यस्यापीत्य् अर्थः ॥ ५.४६ ॥

‘*Pitṛmedha*’— *i.e*., the final sacrificial offering; others hold that
the term stands for the entire procedure (of the Śrāddha);—performing
this, the pupil *becomes purified in ten days*. This same rule applies
to the Student also.

‘*Just as those who carry the dead body*’;—for those who take out the
dead body, the period is ten days; and so it is for the pupil
also.—(64).

(Verse 65 of other commentators.)

‘*Pitṛmedha*’—The *Antyeṣṭi* (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘the entire Śrāddha ceremony’ (‘others’ noted by
Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 912), which says that the
‘*guru*’ meant here is *Ācārya*, and that ‘*Pitṛmedha*’ is
*Antyeṣṭi*;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.24), to the effect that if the pupil
performs *Antyeṣṭi* of his *guru*, then he is to be impure for ten
days;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 381) as reiterating the ‘ten-day’ period
for all carriers of the dead body, the ‘pupil’ being mentioned only by
way of illustration.
