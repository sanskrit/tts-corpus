One should not have a dead Brāhmaṇa carried by a Śūdra, while his own people are there. For it would be an oblation into fire, defiled by the touch of the Śūdra, and as such not conducive to heaven.—(l 03).

‘*Have carried*’—have taken out.

‘*While his own people are there*’—*i.e*., men of the same caste. The
use of the term ‘*oblation into fire*’ implies that the body should not
also be burnt by the *Śūdra*.

The specification of the ‘Brāhmaṇa’ is not emphasised; for the
*Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya* also the Śūdra’s touch is defiling; hence
what the supplementary statement indicates is that the prohibition
applies to the case of these two also.—(103).

(Verse 104 of others.)

According to Nārāyaṇa this rule is meant for Brāhmaṇas only; but
Medhātithi says that the ‘*vipra*’ is mentioned only by way of
illustration; the rule applies to all the three higher castes.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.20);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 634), which reproduces the remark made in *Mitākṣarā* that
the phrase ‘*sveṣu tiṣṭhatsu*’ is superfluous, in view of the assertion
(in the second half) that the touching of the body by the lower castes
is ‘*asvargya*,’ which would imply that the body should not be so
touched, irrespective of the presence or absence of the dead person’s
‘own people’;—and in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 17).

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 395), which also adds the same
remark;—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 120) which says —‘*sveṣu tiṣṭhatsu*’ means
that if possible the dead body of a Brāhmaṇa should be carried by
Brāhmaṇas alone, in the absence of Brāhmaṇas by Kṣatriyas, even by
Vaiśyas in the absence of Kṣatriyas, and by Śūdras only when there are
no Vaiśyas—‘*asvargyā*,’ this also refers to cases where twice-born
persons are available.

*Viṣṇu* (19.1).—‘One must not cause a dead member of a twice-born caste
to be carried by a Śūdra; nor a Śūdra by a twice-born person.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 634).—‘When a sacrificer dies, the Śūdra
shall not carry his dead body; that dead person for whom the Śūdra
carries fire, grass or wood, remains a *ghost* for ever and becomes
defiled by sin.’

104	Let him not allow a dead Brahmana to be carried out by a Sudra, while men of the same caste are at hand; for that burnt-offering which is defiled by a Sudra's touch is detrimental to (the deceased's passage to) heaven.
