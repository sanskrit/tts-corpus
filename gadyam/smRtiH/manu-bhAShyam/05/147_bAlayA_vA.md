**स्वातन्त्र्यं** स्त्रीषु कस्यांचिद् अवस्थायां नास्तीत्य् उपदेशार्थः । वयोविभागवचनं तु यत्रास्याः पार्तन्त्र्यं तत्प्रदर्शनार्थम् अविवक्षितस्वरूपम् ॥ ५.१४५.

The sense of the teaching is that under no circumstances should there be
independence for women. The mention of the various stages of her age, is
meant only to indicate where she has to be dependent upon others, and no
significance is meant to attach to it.—(145).
