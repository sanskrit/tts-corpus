For the cleansing of the ejectors or urine and faeces, earth and water should be used, as much as may be necessary; as also in the twelve cleansings of the bodily excretions.—(132).

The impurity of the bodily excretions having been asserted in 131, the
present verse proceeds to lay down directions for their cleansing.

‘*Ejectors of urine and faeces*’—*i.e*., the. organs by which these are
passed,—*i*. *e*. the Anus &c.;—for the cleansing of these—one should
‘*use earth and water*, *as much as may be necessary*’; *i*. *e*. not
minding any restrictions as to the number (of washings and rubbings),
one should go on taking up as much water and earth as may be necessary
for the total removal of smells and stains.

‘*Bodily*’—proceeding from the body,—‘*excretions*’—which are sources of
impurity. In connection with the purifications necessitated by these
also, earth and water are to be used as much as may be necessary. In
another *Smṛti* we read—‘In the case of the former six excretions both
earth and water should be used; in the case of the latter six one is
purified even by the use of water only’.

In connection with phlegm &c. it is thus declared in another
*Smṛti*—‘The viscid excretion from the nose is called *Phlegm*’; and
since this occurs among the latter group of six, for cleansing it earth
need not be used at all.—(132).

(Verse 134 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 271), which explains ‘*arthavat*’
as ‘as much as may be needed for removing the smell and stains,’ and
adds that in the case of the latter six of the twelve ‘impurities’
(enumerated in the next verse) the use of clay is optional;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 51), which adds that after the passing of urine and
feces, washing with water is ‘*arthavat*,’ ‘useful’;—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 45), which explains ‘*arthavat*’ as ‘fulfilling the purposes
of removing the smell and stains’;—and again on p. 104, to say that Manu
should be understood to mean that *out* of the case of the twelve
‘impurities,’ in some both water and clay should be used, while in some
either of the two only;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 794).

*Gautama* (1.42, 43).—‘Purification from defilement by unclean
substances is effected when the stains and the smell have been
removed;—and this shall be done first by water and then by earth.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.10.11-15).—‘After urinating, he shall cleanse it with
earth and water; in like manner on evacuating bowels;—after an emission
of semen, in the same manner as after urinating.’

*Āpastamba* (1.16.14-15).—‘On touching the effluvia of the nose or the
eyes,... he shall either bathe or sip or merely touch water;—or he may
touch moist cowdung, wet herbs or moist earth.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (6.14, 16).—‘He shall perform the purification with water and
with earth... For purification, the Brāhmaṇa shall take earth mixed with
gravel from the river-bank.’

*Viṣṇu* (60.24).—‘Having cleaned his hind parts with a clod of earth, or
with brick...... he must rise and clean himself with water and earth—so
as to remove the smell and the filth.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.17).—‘The man shall perform purification with earth and
water fetched for the purpose—till the stain and the smell disappear.’

134	In order to cleanse (the organs) by which urine and faeces are ejected, earth and water must be used, as they may be required, likewise in removing the (remaining ones among) twelve impurities of the body.
