अस्थिशृङ्गदन्ताः स्पृश्यानां गोमेषहस्त्यादीनाम्, न श्वगर्दभादीनाम् । **गोमूत्रोदकयोर्** विकल्पः । गौरसर्षपकल्कस् तु समुच्चीयते ॥ ५.१२० ॥

The ‘bone’, ‘horn’ and ‘tusk’ meant are those of the touchable
animals,—the cow, the sheep end the elephant,—and not of such animals as
the dog, the ass and the like.

‘*Water*’ and ‘*cow’s urine*’ are optional alternatives; while the use
of ‘white mustard’ is to be combined with either of these.—(120).
