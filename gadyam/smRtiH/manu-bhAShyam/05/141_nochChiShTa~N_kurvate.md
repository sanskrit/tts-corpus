Drops from the mouth, if they do not reach the body, do not make one impure; nor the hairs of the beard that enter the mouth; nor what adheres to the teeth.—(139).

In the text—‘on having spat and on having told a lie &c.’ (5.144)—it has
been laid down that on spitting one should sip water; which indicates
that until one has sipped water, he remains impure. Drops issuing from
the mouth would also be a form of ‘spitting;; so that the issuing of
drops of water from the mouth standing on the same footing as the
spitting of phlegm, it might be thought that it should necessitate the
sipping of water. With a view to this contingency, the author has added
the present verse.

‘*Mukhyaḥ*’— produced in, or issuing from, the mouth such ‘*drops*’ do
not make one impure, if they do not fall upon the body.

“But it has been already declared that drops are pure (5-132.)”

But that was with reference to things other than bodily excretions. That
this was meant there is clearly indicated by the present verse; which
makes it clear that *all kinds of drops* were not meant when they were
declared to be pure.

‘*Śmaśruṇi*’—hairs of the beard,—‘*that enter the mouth*’—‘do not make
one impure’; this has to be construed with the present phrase; so that
they do become the cause of some slight evil effects (even though they
do not make the man impure).

So also ‘*what adheres to the teeth*.’ In connection with this we have
greater details in another *Smṛti text*—‘What adheres to the teeth is
like the teeth, except what is touched by the tongue;—some say that this
is so before it falls off from the teeth;—what falls off is to be
treated as saliva the man becomes pure by swallowing it.’ (*Gautama*
1.38 to 40.) ‘Those that fall off’—*i.e*. without bang touched by the
tongue: since the touch of the tongue has been declared to be not
pure.—(139).

(Verse 141 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 353), which explains
‘*mukhyāḥ*’ as ‘those proceeding from the mouth’ and
‘*Dantāntaraviṣṭitam*’ (which is its reading for *Dhiṣṭhitam*) as ‘what
has entered between the teeth’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 972),
which explains *Dantānta* as between the teeth or in the teeth-cavities
and *adhiṣṭhitam* as *attached*.

*Viṣṇu* (23.53).—‘Such drops as fall from the mouth of a man upon any
part of his body do not render it impure; nor do hairs of the beard that
enter his month; nor remnants of food adhering to his teeth.’

*Gautama* (1.38-41).—‘Remnants of food adhering to the teeth are as his
teeth (and do not make him impure), except if he touches them with the
tongue; or before they fall from their place, according to some people;
if they do become detached, he should know that he is purified by merely
swallowing them, like saliva; drops of saliva dropping from the mouth do
not cause impurity, except when they fall on a limb of the body.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.8.24, 25).—‘What adheres to the teeth should be regarded
like the teeth; because it is fixed like the teeth. Let him not sip
water on their account in case it falls; if it flows out, he shall be
pure. They quote the following:—“If anything adheres to the teeth, it is
pure like the teeth; and if he swallows it, or whatever else may be in
the mouth, or may remain there after he has sipped water, he will become
pure.”’

*Āpastamba* (1.16.11-13).—‘He does not become impure by the hair of his
moustache getting into his mouth, as long as he does not touch them with
his hand; if drops of saliva are perceived to fall from his mouth, then
he shall sip water; some people declare that if the saliva falls on the
ground, he need not sip water.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.37).—‘Drops of saliva falling from the mouth, which do not
touch a limb of the body, do not make a man impure.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.195).—‘Drops issuing from the mouth are pure; so also
the water dropped in sipping water; and the hair of the moustache
entering one’s mouth; if anything adheres to the teeth, the man becomes
pure by throwing it out.’

*Śaṅkha* (Aparārka, p. 277).—‘What adheres to the teeth is like the
teeth, when it is devoid of any taste,—except when it is touched by the
tongue.’

*Devala* (Do.).—‘What adheres to the teeth and cannot be taken out
should be regarded as the teeth; and he should not make much effort to
take it out, as if the sticks used wounded him, he would become very
impure.’
