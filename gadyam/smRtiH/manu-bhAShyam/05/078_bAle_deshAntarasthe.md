**बाले** ऽदन्तजाते सूनौ । **देशान्तरस्थे** **पृथक्पिण्डे च संस्थिते**, इत्य् एकार्थानि पदानि । **पृथक्पिण्डः** समानोदक इति यावत् । तस्मिन् **देशान्तरस्थे संस्थिते** सद्यः शुद्धिः । संनिधौ "त्र्यहात् तूदकदायिनः" (म्ध् ५.६३) इत्य् उक्तम् ॥ ५.७७ ॥

‘*Child*’—*i.e*., a son that has not yet teethed;—‘*resident in a
foreign country*’—*who is a non-sapiṇḍa relation*’—‘*dying*’,—all these
terms are in apposition.

‘*Non-Sapiṇḍa*’—*i.e*., *Samānodaka*.

When such a person dies while residing in a foreign country, the
purification is ‘immediate.’

When such a person dies near at hand, then the purification comes sifter
‘three days’—as declared in verse 63 above—(77).

VERSE LXXVII

(Verse 78 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 905), which notes that
‘*deśāntarastha*,’ ‘in a distant country,’ qualifies both the ‘*bāla*’
and the ‘*asapiṇḍa*’;—again on p. 909, where the ‘*pṛthakpiṇḍa*’ is
explained as the ‘non-sapiṇḍa and the ‘*bāla*’ as ‘one whose naming has
not been done’;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 33), which explains ‘*deśāntarastha*’
etc., to mean that ‘on hearing of the death of a Sapiṇḍa after the lapse
of ten days, those for whom the normal period of impurity is one day
only, becomes purified immediately, by bathing only;—and in
*Dānakriyākaumudī* (p. 25).

The verse is quoted also in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 274).
