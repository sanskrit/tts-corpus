This is a purely commendatory description.

In the series of commendatory passages beginning with the words
‘*agnirvai varuṇam*’ and ending with ‘*abhyākāmyata*’, the origin of
gold and silver has been described; the meaning of which is that—‘Agni
approached Varuṇa, *i.e*., water, in the manner of a male approaching a
female, and had sexual intercourse with it, and out of this sprang gold
and silver.’

For this reason the purification of these is done by means of their
‘source’; *i.e*., by fire when there is much defilement, and algo by
water.

Another reading is ‘*Sayonyā*’; in which case the meaning is ‘by that
which has the same source as themselves’, *i.e*., by ash. And in
accordance with this view cleansing by means of clay is also sometimes
permitted.

The ‘*purification is best done*’.— (112).

113	From the union of water and fire arose the glittering gold and silver; those two, therefore, are best purified by (the elements) from which they sprang.
