Having eaten these unintentionally, he should perform the ‘Kṛcchra Sāntapana’, or the ‘Yati-Cāndrāyaṇa’; and in the case of the rest one should fast for a day.—(20)

‘*Unintentionally*’—unwillingly,—^(‘)*having eaten these*’—any one of
the six just mentioned that it is any *one* that is meant, and not *all
together*, is indicated by the fact that the act of eating in this case
is nor. what is actually *enjoined*.

^(‘)*In* *the case* *of* *the rest*’—*i.e*. in the case of eating the
other things—‘red exudations from trees’ and other things forbidden
above,—one should desist from eating ‘*for a day*’;—the term^(‘)day’ is
used as including the *night* also; *e.g*. in such passages as^(‘)the
day is dark, the day is bright’ —(*Ṛgveda* 6.9.1.)

In connection with the eating of some of the things here forbidden, the
text is going to prescribe in the section on Expiatory

Rites (Discourse 11) distinct expiatory rites:—*e.g*., in connection
with^(‘)carnivorous animals, pig etc.’ (11.156); and in this case those
are the Rites to be performed; since they have been directly enjoined in
so man words; specially as the single ‘day’s fast’ here prescribed will
have its application only in cases other than those especially provided
for.—(20)

*Cf*. 11.155, 213 and 219.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (pp. 927 and 825) as laying
down the expiation for the *unintentional* eating of the things;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 317) to the same effect, with the
additional note that the ‘Sāntapana’ meant here must he that which
extends over seven days.—The last quarter is quoted twice in *Mitākṣarā*
on 3.290, to the effect that if one eats forbidden things other than
those here mentioned only *once*, and that *unintentionally*, he has got
only to fast for the day;—under 1.175 to the effect that the eating of
the forbidden birds unintentionally makes one liable to fasting for the
day;—and the first three quarters on 1.176, where it is pointed out that
it refers to *unintentional* and *repeated* eating of the things;—also
on 3.229 as laying down the expiation for unintentional eating.

It is also quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1157), to the effect that by
unintentionally eating the things enumerated repeatedly one becomes
liable to the *Yati-cāndrāyaṇa*, and by eating other forbidden things to
fasting during the day.

**(verses 5.20-21)  
**

*Yajñavalkya* (1.176).—(See-above.)

*Parāśara* (2.9-10).—(See above.)

*Śātātapa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 318).—‘Garlic, leek, onion, black
brinjal, mushroom, tame pig, fame; cock, milk of camel, woman or ass,-
on eating these one should undergo the Upanayana again and perform the
‘taptakṛcchra repeatedly.’

*Viṣṇu* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 319).—‘On eating the flesh of dogs, and on
eating mushrooms, one should perform the *Sāntapana*; on eating
substances cooked overnight,—except preparations of barley or wheat or
milk, or what is smeared with oils, or dry sugar-candy—one should fast.
Substances growing out of incisions or unclean things, the red exudation
from trees, needlessly cooked rice-sesamum,... on eating these one
should fast for three days and should stand in water for one day.’

020	He who unwittingly partakes of (any of) these six, shall perform a Samtapana (Krikkhra) or the lunar penance (Kandrayana) of ascetics; in case (he who has eaten) any other (kind of forbidden food) he shall fast for one day (and a night ).
