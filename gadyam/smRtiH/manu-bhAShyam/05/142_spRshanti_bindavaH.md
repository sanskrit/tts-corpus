‘*Helping others to wash*,’—*i.e*. offering water to other persons.

The meaning is as follows When one is pouring water for another person
and the latter begins to sip water, if drops of water flowing out from
between the fingers of that person happen to fall on the ground and
rising from it, touch the feet of the man who is offering the
water,—that man is not made impure by them.

‘*Those on the ground*’.—The drops of water fulling from the hand of the
washing person, though unclean, should be regarded to be as clean as
small quantities of water collected on clean ground.

‘*By them*,’— touched, the man does not become impure.—(140)

(Verse 142 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 276);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 228), which notes that *pādau* here include the other limbs
also;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 113), which adds the following
notes:—

The construction is *parān ācāmayataḥ*; —*bhūmigaiḥ* means ‘the drops of
water falling on the ground’;—the use of the term *ācāmayataḥ* implies
that if the drops of water fallen from the washings of one man happen to
touch others than the one who is helping in the washing,—then those
latter do become impure;—*pādau* includes other parts of the body
also,—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 251),—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 972),
which says that the construction is *parānācamayataḥ pādau*, and the
meaning is that ‘when one is pouring water for another person rinsing
his mouth, then if the water dropped by the latter falls upon the feet
of the former, it does not make him unclean, because that water is
*bhaumikaiḥ samāḥ*, clean as any ordinary water on the ground,—it
follows that this refers only to the man who is pouring water for the
other; other persons standing by do become unclean by the water-drops
falling on then feet,—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 281);—and in
*Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 353).
