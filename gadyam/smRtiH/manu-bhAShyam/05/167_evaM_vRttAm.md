न्यायप्राप्ताप्तानुवादः श्लोकः । एवं तस्याः साध्वीत्याद्युक्त एवात्राग्निहोतिणः संस्कारः । "न वाग्नयो ह वा एते पत्न्यां प्रमीतायां धार्यन्ते" इति ॥ ५.१६५ ॥

This verse reiterates what is already implied by the law.

In us much as she is a ‘good’ wife, it is only right that she should be
cremated with the sacred *Agnihotra* fire; specially in view of the
assertion—‘on the death of the wife the Fires are not maintained’—(165).
