‘*The eating of meat*—in the form of offerings and oblations —‘*for
sacrifices*.’

‘*This* *is* *the div* *ine law*’;—this is what has been ordained by the
Gods.

‘*Behaviour contrary to this*,’—*i.e*. eating meat for the fattening of
the body—is ‘*the* *demonical pract* *ice*’; it is only demons that eat
meat in this fashion. This is said in deprecation of the practice.—(31)

“*Cf*. this with the Mahābhārata, 13.114-116. In *ib* 116, 15, this is
quoted as Śruti, but in 115, 53, its gist is ascribed to Manu”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 527), which adds the
following notes:—‘*yajñāya*’ means ‘for purposes of
sacrifice’,—‘*yagdhi*’ means ‘eating’,—‘*atonyathā*’ means ‘elsewhere
than at a sacrifice’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 582).

031	'The consumption of meat (is befitting) for sacrifices,' that is declared to be a rule made by the gods; but to persist (in using it) on other (occasions) is said to be a proceeding worthy of Rakshasas.
