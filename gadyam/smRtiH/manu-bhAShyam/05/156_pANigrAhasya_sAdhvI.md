‘*Her husband’s regions*’—The regions to which she has become entitled
by the performance of religions acts in the company of her husband.

‘*Being desirous*’ of reaching those regions,—‘*she should never do
anything that might be disagreeable*’; *i.e*., such acts as intercourse
with other men and so forth, *which have been forbidden by the
Scriptures*. It is not possible for anyone to ascertain what is
agreeable or disagreeable to the dead person; it is not necessary that
what was agreeable to the living would be agreeable to the dead also;
because notions of pleasure and displeasure vary with the varying
conditions of men. From all this it follows that what is meant by
‘disagreeable’ here is that ‘freedom of life’ which has been forbidden
for women and this the good wife should avoid.—(154).
