The ‘ground’ is mentioned only by way of illustration; so that water in
canals is also pure. Water on the ground, as also in the atmosphere, is,
by its very nature, pure; but the ground, being in contact with unclean
substances, is slightly impure; hence when water is collected on the
ground, it imbibes impurity by contact; and the present text proceeds to
point out what quantity of water thus collected is to be regarded as
*pure*:—‘*Sufficient to* *allay the thirst of the cow*’;—‘*vaitṛṣṇyam*’
means *freedom* *from* *thirst*, This is meant to indicate a particular
quantity; this explanation having been adopted by the ancients on the
strength of the words of the Veda—‘so that the dawlap of the cow dapples
in water &c. &c.’ Thus the quantity meant is that in which the cow’s
dewlap becomes submerged, or which allays her thirst.

Water collected on pure ground is pure, even in small quantities.

“How is it to be known that water has been ‘*contaminated by an unclean
thing*’?”

In answer to this we have the phrase—‘*becoming affected by its*
*smell*, *colour and taste*,’ The Instrumental ending in ‘*amedhyena*’,
‘*by* *an unclean thing*’, has to be changed here into the *genitive*;
the meaning being—‘when the water imbibes the smell, colour and taste
*of* *the unclean thing*, then it is to be regarded as *contaminated* by
it.’ According to this construction, if in a tank, an unclean thing be
found in one part, while in another part the water be found to be free
from its smell &c., then this latter is to be regarded as pure—(126).

(Verse 128 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 272);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
618);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 119);—in *Śuddhikaumudī*
(pp. 297 and 341), which says that ‘*rūpa etc*.’ means that one should
shun that water which has an evil smell, bad colour and bad taste; the
natural colour and taste of water are white and sweet, and though there
is no natural smell, yet of transferred smell only the agreeable one is
to be accepted, hence the meaning is that water should be used only when
it is either odourless or has an agreeable odour;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Śrāddha, p. 14b);—and in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 81).

*Baudhāyana* (1.9.10).—‘Water collected on the ground with which cows
slake their thirst is a means of purification, provided it is not
strongly mixed with unclean substances, nor has smell, nor is
discoloured, nor has taste.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.35, 36, 47).—‘Water (for sipping) may be taken even out of
a hole in the ground, if it is sufficient to slake the thirst of cows.
He shall not purify himself with water that has been defiled with
colours, perfumes or flavouring substances; nor with such as is
collected in unclean places. Water collected on the ground that quenches
the thirst of the cows, the Lord of created things has declared to be
pure.’

*Viṣṇu* (23.43).—‘Stagnant water, if even a single cow can quench her
thirst with it, is pure, unless it is quite filled with unclean objects;
it is the same with water upon a rock.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.192).—‘Water in its natural condition, standing on the
ground, is pure, if it is sufficient to satisfy a cow.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 272).—‘That water is declared to he purificatory
which is devoid of smell and flavour, free from dirt, and such as would
not disappear if a cow were to drink out of it.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 273).—‘Water, at a drinking booth in the forest, or
in a jar, or in a well, or in a water-pot, or in a stone-cup, or in a
leather-bag, is unfit for drinking, except in times of distress.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 119).—‘Rain-water collected on the ground is
purified in ten nights.’
