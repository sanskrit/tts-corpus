The mushroom, the village-pig, garlic, the village-cock, onions and leeks,—the twice-born man eating these intentionally would become an ou tcast.—(19).

**छत्राकं** कवकानि । **विड्वराहः** ग्रामशूकरः स्वतन्त्रविहरः । एतानि भक्षयित्वा पतितो भवेत् । पतितप्रायश्चित्तं कुर्यात् । वक्ष्यति च "गर्हितान्नाद्ययोर् जग्धिः सुरापानसमानि षट्" (म्ध् ११.५५) ॥ ५.१९ ॥

‘*Chatraka*’ is the same as *karaka*, the mushroom.

‘*Viḍvarāha*’ is the village-pig, which wanders about unchecked.

By eating these the man becomes an outcast. That is, he should perform
the Expiatory Rites prescribed for outcasts. It will be asserted later
on (11.56)—‘The eating of forbidden food is like the drinking of
wine.’—(19)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1157), which notes that the
intentional eating of these things make the twice-born person an
‘outcast,’ *i.e*., disqualifies him from all that is done by twice-born
persons, and the expiation for this would be the same as that prescribed
for wine-drinking.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.176), which says that this refers to
intentional and repeated eating of the things; also on 3.229;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 317), as referring to intentional
eating;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 825) to the effect that the
intentional eating of forbidden things is equal to wine-drinking; and
again on p. 927, to the effect that *it is intentional and repeated*
eating that is equal to wine-drinking and hence makes one outcast, while
by intentionally eating these only *once*, one only becomes liable to
the performance of the *Cāndrāyaṇa*.

*Gautama* (23.5).—‘(Expiation is to be performed) for the eating of tame
cocks or tame pigs.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.3-4).—‘If the twice-born eat of the following—garlic, onion,
tame pig, tame cock,—he should perform expiations and should go through
the sacraments over again.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.176).—‘Onion, tame pig, mushroom, tame cock, garlic,
and leeks,—on eating these one should perform the Cāndrāyaṇa.’

*Parāśara* (2.9-10).—‘Milk of newly calved cow, white garlic, brinjals,
leeks, onion, exudation from trees, the property of gods, mushrooms,
milk of the camel, milk of sheep,—if the twice-born eats these
unintentionally, he becomes purified by fasting for three days and
eating *Pañcagavya*.’
