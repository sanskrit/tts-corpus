For one who is killed in battle with brandished weapons, in the manner
befitting the Kṣatriya, sacrificial performances become instantly
completed; and so also is the impurity; such is the established
law—(97).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Śastra*’, ‘*weapon*’, is that by which people are slain, killed; hence
by the present rule, also for the man who is killed by pieces of stone
or a club or such other things, sacrificial performances become
completed.

‘*Āhava*’, ‘Battle is so called because in this men are *challenged*
(*āhūyante*) to fight, through mutual rivalry.

‘*Manner befitting the Kṣatriya*;—*i.e*., never turning his
back,—fighting in the defence of his people, or under orders from his
master.

‘*Sacrificial performances*’—such as the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the
rest;—‘*become instantly completed*’—finished. That is, the man becomes
endowed with the merit proceeding from the due performance of the
sacrifices.

Impurity also in their case is the same; *i.e*. it ceases immediately.

Some people construe the term ‘*sadyaḥ*’, ‘*instantly*’, with the word
‘*killed*’; and according to this what is said here would apply to the
case of only that man who actually dies on this battle-field, and not to
one who is moved away from there and dies on some other day.

This point however is open to question.—(97).

*Yājñavalkya* (3. 29).—‘During the performance of charity, in battle, in
sacrificial performances, in times of public disturbance, and under
great distress, purification is instantaneous.’

*Parāśara* (3.30-31).—‘In this world, two men pierce through the solar
orbit—the mendicant firm in Yoga and one killed in the battle-front.’

098	By him who is slain in battle with brandished weapons according to the law of the Kshatriyas, a (Srauta) sacrifice is instantly completed, and so is the period of impurity (caused by his death); that is a settled rule.
