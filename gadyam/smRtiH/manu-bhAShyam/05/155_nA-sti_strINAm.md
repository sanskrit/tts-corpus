There is no separate sacrificing for women, no observances, no fastings; it is by means of serving her husband that she becomes exalted in heaven.—(153).

It has been more than once explained that women, separated from their
husbands are not entitled to the performance of sacrifices. From this it
follows that, when going to keep an observance or to take to a fast, she
should obtain his permission.

‘*Observance*’ here stands for the vow to give up meat, wine and such
things; it does not stand for the *Kṛcchra* and other penancce; because
the repeating of *mantras* and offering of libertions form part of these
latter, end to these the women is not entitled. It will not be right to
argue here that—“it would be possible for the woman to perform the
*Kṛcchra* and other penances, omitting the mantras and the libations”
because it can never be right to abandon, at one’s will, the details of
a sacrificial performance; specially as it is only the act complete in
all its details that is regarded as lending to prosperity and success.
Nor does the dropping or adding of details depend upon the varying
capacities of performers. Then again, a woman has always available men
of her own caste, among the three higher castes, who could perform for
her the mid acts. For these reasons neither the woman nor the *Śūdra*,
desiring her own welfare, is entitled to the performance of the
*Kṛcchra* and other penances. We shall explain this in detail under the
*Expiatory Rites*.

‘*Fasting*’—living without food, giving up eating for one day. two days
or such limited periods.

^(‘)*Serves*’—attends upon.—(153).

(Verse 155 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, pp. 52 and 129),
which says that if she does the fasting with the husband’s permission,
there is nothing wrong;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 675), which says that
this refers to the ‘month-fast’ and so forth, and not to those in
connection with the *Gaurīvrata* and the like;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Saṃskāra, p. 67a);—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī*, (p. 579);—in
*Purṣārthacintāmaṇi*, (p. 201);—in *Smṛtisāroddhara*, (p. 101);—in
*Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 176);—in *Kālamādhava* (p. 257);—in *Aparārka* (p.
602), which adds that the wife may, with her husband’s permission, keep
such fasts and observances as are not incompatible with her attendance
upon him;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 193);—and in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p.
729) to the effect that religious acts art; to be performed by the wife
only in association with her husband.

155	No sacrifice, no vow, no fast must be performed by women apart (from their husbands); if a wife obeys her husband, she will for that (reason alone) be exalted in heaven.
