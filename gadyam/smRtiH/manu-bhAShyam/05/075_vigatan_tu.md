‘*Foreign country*,’—means *another village*, &c., as before.

‘*Vigatam*’—dead.

‘*Within ten days*’.—This is only by way of illustration: what is meant
is the period of impurity that has been prescribed in each case;—the
remainder of that period would be the period to be observed in the
special case mentioned. The repeated mention of ‘*ten days*’ is for the
purpose of filling up the metre.

The period of impurity due to birth and death is determined by their
origin; so that the periods of ‘ten days’ and the rest are to be counted
from the day on which the birth or the death may have taken place, and
not from the day on which it may become known to the relations. As a
result of this, if the guest happen to know of the birth, &c., having
occurred in the house, he should not take his food in that house, even
though the master of that house himself may still be ignorant of it.
Thus in both cases (of death and birth) the counting is to be done from
the day of origination.

Thus those who are subject to impurity for ‘ten days’ shall remain
impure for the remainder of that period; and for those who are subject
to a period of ‘three days’, purification is obtained immediately, by
bathing along with all the clothing that may be on them.—(74).

(Verse 75 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 385), in support of the view
that if one cause of impurity should happen during the period of
impurity due to another cause, then the former should be regarded as
over by the end of the latter.

*Videśa* or *Deśāntara* is thus defined by ‘Vṛddha-Manu’ quoted in
*Aparārka* (p. 905):—‘That which is interposed by a great river (a river
falling directly into the sea) or by a mountain, or where the language
is different.’

It is quoted in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 70);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
232), which explains ‘*vigatam*’ as ‘dead’ and adds that this rule
applies to cases of *birth* also, and that ‘ten days’ stands for the
full period of impurity under normal conditions;—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p.
36);—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 32) which has the following
notes:—‘*videśastham*’ in another country, *i.e*., from where the news
of death cannot come quickly,—‘*anirdaśam*,’ before the end of ten days.

In regard to ‘*videśa*’, *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 71) quotes Rudradhara
as saying that even though there be no intervening mountains or rivers,
if the distance between two countries is more than 60 *yojanas*—*e.g*.,
Tirhut and Prayāga,—they are ‘*videśa*’ to each other, but not so
between Tirhut and Kaśi, the distance between which is only 30
*yojanas*.
