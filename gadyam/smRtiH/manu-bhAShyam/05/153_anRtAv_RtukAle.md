The husband is ‘*the importer of happiness*’ to his wife ‘*out of
season*’ also,—in accordance with the rule ‘one may have recourse to his
wife at all times, except on the days expressly prohibited.’

‘*Mantric sacramental rite*’—*i.e*., the marriage-ceremony; he who has
performed this is called the ‘*Mantrasaṃskārakṛt*.’

‘*In the next world*.’—Since it is only along with her husband that the
wife is entitled to the performance of religious acts, and the acquiring
of their results,—the husband is called ‘*the importer of happiness in
the next world*,’—(151).
