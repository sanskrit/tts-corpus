एतैर् **लोकेशैर्** **अधिष्ठितो** **राजा** । नास्य **शौचाशौचम्**, यतो **मर्त्यानां** मनुष्याणाम् आभ्याम् अधिकारः । तयोश् च **प्रभवाप्ययौ** प्रवृत्तिनिवृत्ती **लोकेभ्यः** सकाशान् **मर्त्यानां**, न तु लोकेशानाम् एव ॥ ५.९६ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The king is possessed by the said Lords of the World; for him there is
no purity or impurity; because the effect of these is only upon mortals;
and their origin and end proceed from the world; hence they affect
mortals, and not the Lords of the World.—(96).

(Verse 97 of others.)

Buhler wrongly attributes to Medhātithi the reading
*lokeśaprabhāpyayau*; the reading really adopted by Medhātithi is
*lokebhyaḥ prabhāvāpyayau*.

<details><summary>Bühler</summary>

097	Because the king is pervaded by those lords of the world, no impurity is ordained for him; for purity and impurity of mortals is caused and removed by (those) lords of the world.
