अधिकपुष्ट्यर्थं यो मांसम् अश्नाति तस्येयं निन्दा । न तु रोगोत्पत्तिभयाशङ्कया । यत आह । **यो वर्धयितुम् इच्छन्तीति** । तस्याप्य् **अनभ्यर्च्य पितॄन् देवान्** । न तु रोगहेतोत्स् त्व् अर्चनम् अकुर्वतो ऽपि कथंचिद् असंभवान् न दोषः ॥ ५.५२ ॥

This deprecates the man who eats meat for the purposc of fattening
himself, and not one who does it for averting disease. That this is so
is clear from the words of the text ‘*he who seeks to increase*.’ In him
also, only if he does it ‘*without worshipping the Gods and Pitṛs*.’ But
if the man is ill, and recovery is not possible without eating meat,
then there would be no harm, even if the said worshipping were not
done.—(52).

052	There is no greater sinner than that (man) who, though not worshipping the gods or the manes, seeks to increase (the bulk of) his own flesh by the flesh of other (beings).
