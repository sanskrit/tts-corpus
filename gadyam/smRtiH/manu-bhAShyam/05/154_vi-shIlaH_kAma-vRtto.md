**(verses 5.152-153)  
**

*Yājñavalkya* (1.77).—‘Women should act up to the words of their
husbands,—this is the highest duty of woman.’

*Śaṅkha* (Aparārka, p. 102).—‘Only with the permission of her husband
shall she undertake fasts, observances and the like.’

*Viṣṇu* (25.15-16).—‘No sacrifice, no penance, and no fasting is
permitted to women apart from their husbands; to pay obedience to her
lord is the only means for a woman to obtain bliss in heaven. A woman
who keeps a fast or performs a penance in the life-time of her husband,
deprives him of his life and will go to hell.’

*Mārkaṇḍeya* (Parāśaramādhava, Prāyaścitta, p. 31).—‘If a woman without
the permission of her father, husband or son performs a penance, it
becomes futile.’

*Kātyāyana* (Parāśaramādhava, Prāyaścitta, p. 31).—‘The wife should
perform penances only with the permission of her husband.’
