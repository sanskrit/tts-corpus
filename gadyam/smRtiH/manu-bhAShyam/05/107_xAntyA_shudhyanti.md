Learned men become pure by tolerance; by liberality those who have done what should not be done; secret sinners by the repeating of sacred texts; and by austerity those who are well-versed in the Veda.—(106).

Those who are learned are purified by tolerance; ‘they are never
affected by hatred, jealousy or ill-will; hence even when sin is
rampant, they remain ever pure. ‘Tolerance’ is the property of the Mind
which consists in having the same consideration for all.

Of ‘liberality’ also the efficacy in removing the sin of doing what
sought not to be done has been described under 11.139, where it is
declared that ‘murder is wiped off by charity’.

In the section dealing with ‘secret sins’ also it has been declared that
for the expiation of secret sins, one should repeat the sacred texts.

For persons well-versed in the Veda, ‘*austerity*’; which, in their
case, consists in repeating the Vedic texts and also cultivating
knowledge; as it has been declared that—‘for the Brāhmaṇa, learning is
the real austerity’ (11.235). As regards the ‘*kṛcchra*’ and other
penances, they are, means of purification for all men, not only for
those versed in the Veda.—(106).
