The first three quarters sum up the section dealing with Purifications;
and the fourth states briefly what is going to be explained.

The term ‘*rule regarding cleanliness*’, though a general one, yet, by
reason of the proximity of the term ‘purification of substances’, is to
be taken as standing for purification other than this latter; just as in
the case of the expression ‘*go-balīvarda*’ (the term ‘*go*’ stands for
the *cow* as distinguished from the *bull*, *balīvarda*).

‘*Duties of women*,’—such duties as have to be performed exclusively by
women; those that are common to men and women—such as the performance of
sacrifices and the like—are not described here.—(144).
