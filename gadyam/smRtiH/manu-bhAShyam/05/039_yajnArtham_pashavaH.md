Animals have been created by the Self-born God himself for the purpose of sacrifice: sacrifice is conducive to the well-being of all this would; hence killing at a sacrifice is no ‘killing’ at all—(39).

The evil just described does not pertain to the killing of animals at
the rites prescribed by *Śruti* and S *mṛti*.

That ‘killing’ which forms part of sacrifices,—for the due fulfilment of
that were animals ‘*created*’—produced, brought into existence,—‘*by the
self-born God*’—Prajāpati ‘*himself*.’

This is a purely commendatory passage.

‘*Sacrifice*’—in the form of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the rest—‘*is
conducive to the well-being*’—prosperity, development, advancement —‘*of
all this*’— world.

For this reason the killing that is done at a sacrifice should be
regarded as no killing at all. What this means is that it does not
involve the sin of ‘killing’ animals.—(39)

“*Ityapi śrūyate śrutiḥ* is the end of this verse instead of *svayameva
svayambhuvā* as found in the *Mahābhārata*, 13.116.14. Quite a number of
Manu’s verses are cited as *Śruti* in the Epic.”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 538).

*Viṣṇu* (51.61).—(Same as Manu.)

039	Svayambhu (the Self-existent) himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices; sacrifices (have been instituted) for the good of this whole (world); hence the slaughtering (of beasts) for sacrifices is not slaughtering (in the ordinary sense of the word).
