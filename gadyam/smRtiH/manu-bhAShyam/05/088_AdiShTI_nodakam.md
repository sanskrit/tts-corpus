‘*Ādiṣṭa*’ means ‘*ādeśa*’, ‘instruction’; and the term ‘*person under
instruction*’ denotes the *Student*, by reason of his connection with
the instruction that he receives regarding his observances. The present
text prohibits the making of water-offerings by one who is still in the
state of the Student, to such *Sapiṇḍa* relations as may happen to die
*during that period*. As for those that have died before, the offering
of water to the forefathers and Gods has already been prescribed for the
Student also.

‘*Till the completion of his pupilage*;—*i.e*. till the performance of
the ‘*Samāvartana*’ ceremony; and it does not mean any forced completion
of the stage in the interval.

On returning after having finished his observances, he shall make a
water-offering to each of the dead relations on one day; and he should
observe ‘impurity’ for three days.

As regards the making of water-offering to his mother, this is necessary
for the Student also; and such an offering does not interfere with the
proper fulfilment of his observances. In support of this they quote
another *Smṛti* -text—*viz*. ‘The person undergoing instruction does not
commit a wrong in making a water-offering.’—(87).

(Verse 88 of others).

This rule does not apply to the case of the mother (Medhātithi),—father
and mother (Govindarāja),—father, mother and ācārya (Kulluka).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 876), which adds the following
notes:—‘*ādiṣṭī*’ is the ‘Religious Student,’—‘*āvratasya samāpanāt*’
means ‘till the *Samāvartana* ceremony has been performed’;—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 3.5) which adds that the Religious Student is called
‘*ādiṣṭī*’ by reason of his receiving such *ādiṣṭa, ādeśa*, injunction,
as ‘Thou art a Religious Student, drink water, do your duty’ and so
forth;—that this refers to the death of persons other than the Father
and others.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta*, (p. 405) as pertaining to cases other
than the death of the ‘mother and others—it explains ‘*ādiṣṭī*’ as
‘Religious Student,’ but adds that some people explain the term as ‘one
who is undergoing expiatory penance.’ The second half means that on the
expiration of the ‘*vrata*,’ he shall make the water-offering and remain
impure for three days.

It is quoted in *Nirṇayansindhu* (pp. 195 and 392) to the effect that
after the *Samāvartana* ceremony has been performed, the Religious
Student shall observe an ‘impurity’ for three days, for the death of
persons that may have occurred during his studentship;—in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 313), which explains ‘*ādiṣṭī*’ as the
Religious Student;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 201), which has the following
note:—‘*ādiṣṭa*’ stands for the observances prescribed in connection
with Vedic study, and ‘*ādiṣṭī*’ stands for the Religious Student, as
also for other persons that may be keeping certain observances; so long
as the course of the observance has not been finished, the man should
not offer

the death-oblations even to his Preceptor;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā*, (p.
295), which says that *Mitākṣarā* has explained ‘*ādiṣṭī*’ as the
Religious Student;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 216).

*Viṣṇu* (22.87).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.5).—‘The religious student shall not make
water-offerings.’

088	He who has undertaken the performance of a vow shall not pour out libations (to the dead) until the vow has been completed; but when he has offered water after its completion, he becomes pure in three days only.
