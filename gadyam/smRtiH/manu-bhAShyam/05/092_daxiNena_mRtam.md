**पुरद्वारेणेति** पुरग्रहणं ग्रामादीनाम् अप्य् उपलक्षणार्थम् । यत्रानेकद्वारसंभवस् तत्रायं नियमः । यो यत्रेष्टे तस्यायम् उपदेशः । अमङ्गल्यत्वाच् च शूद्राद् आरभ्य कर्मेणोपदिष्टम् । अतश् च **यथायोगम्** इति वैश्यक्षत्रियब्राह्मणाः पश्चिमादिभिर् यथासंख्यं संबन्धनीयाः ॥ ५.९१ ॥

The term ‘*City*’ stands for the village &c. also.

This rule applies to those places where there are several gates; the
advice pertaining to such persons as may be capable of following it.

The *Śūdra* has been mentioned first, because it is an inauspicious
subject. And this reversal of the order indicates that the term
‘*respectively*’ indicates that the *Vaiśya* should be carried by the
western, the *Kṣatriya* by the northern and the *Brāhmaṇa* by the
Eastern gate.—(91)

(Verse 92 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 870), which adds that the word
‘*Nirharaṇīyāḥ*’ is to be supplied after ‘*dvijātayaḥ*’;—and that
‘*Yathāyogam*’ (for which it reads ‘*Yathāvarṇam*’) means that the
castes are to be taken in the reverse order; *i.e*., Brāhmaṇa through
the *eastern* the Kṣatriya through the northern and the Vaiśya through
the western gate,—this on the strength of a text quoted from the
*Adityapurāṇa*.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 634);—in *Nirṇayasindhu*
(p. 414);—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 111);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
216),—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 119), which notes that the castes are
mentioned in the reverse order because the subject spoken of is an
extremely inauspicious one, and by adopting this order the writer avoids
the use of the epithet ‘dead’ directly in

connection with the higher castes;—it explains ‘*Yathāyogam*’ as ‘in the
inverse order, *i.e*., the Vaiśya, the Kṣatriya and the Brāhmaṇa
respectively’.
