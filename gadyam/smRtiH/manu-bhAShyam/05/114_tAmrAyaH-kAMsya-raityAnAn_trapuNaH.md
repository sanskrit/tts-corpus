‘*According to suitability*’.—According to what may be suitable to a
particular thing; *i.e*., that substance should be used for cleaning
which is best fitted to remove the dirt from the object to be cleaned.
It is for this reason that in another *Smṛti* we find it stated
that—‘things made of tin and lead are to be cleansed by means of
cow-dung and chaff.’ Similarly—‘Brass-articles smelt by the cow, or
defiled by the food-leavings of the Śūdra, or defiled by dogs and cows
become cleansed by means of alkaline substances.’ It is with a view to
this that we have the various varieties of alkalines, such as those
prepared out of gruel, or of pomegranates and so forth.—(113).

(Verse 114 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.190);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 805);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī*, (p. 305), which explains ‘*Kṣāra*’ as
‘ashes’—‘*amlodaka*’ as the juice of lemon and such things, this latter
goes with ‘tāmra’ and ‘kṣārodaka’ with rest ,—*washing* goes with
all,—‘*yathārham*’ sufficient to remove dirt and soiling.
