The genetive endings in this verse some people explain as having the
sense of the Nominative, according to Pāṇini’s *Sūtra* 3,3,83; and in
that case the meaning would be—‘the person whose tonsure has not been
performed is purified in one day;’ and it has already been explained
that some options in this connection are also based upon the age and
condition of the person observing the impurity; and the present verse
lays down specific rules in accordance with the general principle there
enunciated.

Others, however, explain the genetive ending as denoting relationship;
and in this case they have to supply some words; the meaning
being—^(‘)the Sapiṇḍa relation of persons whose tonsure has not been
performed etc;, etc.?’

This latter view is what is in keeping with usage.

Another Smṛti text has declared immediate purification; and the same
text has laid down the exact scope of that rule—^(‘)Till the appearance
of teeth, it is immediate: till the performance of the Tonsure, it comes
after one day; and in the case of those whose Tonsure has been
performed, it lasts for three days.’—(66)

(Verse 67 of other commentators.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.23), where it is explained
that all that this means is that in the case of all before initiation,
the impurity lasts for three days;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 373);—and in
*Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 271), which remarks that the second half of the
verse makes it clear to what case the following two verses refer.

Medhātithi offers two constructions:—(1) By one the verse is made to
provide a rule for the impurity of the untonsured child on the death of
others;—(2) by the other, for the impurity of others on the death of the
untonsured children.
