\[*madyairmūtraiḥ* &c.—which forms verse 123 in Kullūka (and also in
Buhler and Burnell)—is not treated as Manu’s text by 
Medhātithi and Govindarāja,—both of them quoting it as from Vaśiṣṭha
(3-59).—It is quoted, however, as ‘Manu’ in *Aparārka* (p. 263);—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 1.191);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 449) to the effect that,
if an earthenware pot happen to be defiled by the contact of the things
mentioned it should be thrown away;—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 306);—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 244)\].
