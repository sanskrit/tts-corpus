Some people think that the term ‘*his own*’ qualifies the ‘Teacher’
only; and it serves to exclude the Teacher’s Teacher, would be thought
of as deserving the same treatment, according to what has been said
above under 2.205.

Others again explain ‘his own’ as standing for one’s *relations*.

But in this latter case, it would seem unnecessary to mention the
‘father’ and the ‘mother.’ But it may be explained as emphasising the
obligatory character of the rule as regards these particular
*relations*.

‘*Monitor*’, ‘*Guru*’,—is one who has been described in 2.149.

There is no harm done to his observances by carrying the dead body of
these persons; and what the text means by this specification is that
there is interference in the observances by the carrying of the dead
bodies of persons other than these—(90).

(Verse 91 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācarā, p. 633) to the effect
that there is nothing wrong in the Religious Student carrying the dead
body of the persons named here;—and in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 391);—in
*Hāralatā* (p. 201) to the effect that when there are no other persons
available for carrying the dead body of the Teacher and the rest and
perform their cremation, then the person who has undertaken vows and
observances may do the needful, and this does not interfere with his
observances,—it explains ‘*ācārya*’ as the person who has done the
initiation and taught the entire Veda, the ‘*upādhyāya*’ is one who has
taught a portion of the Veda or the Subsidiary Sciences, and ‘*guru*’ is
the person who expounds the Veda and the Sciences;—and in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 294).

*Viṣṇu* (22.86).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.15).—‘The religious student retains his character of
religious student even after carrying the dead body of the teacher, the
father and the sub-teacher.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 884).—‘The religious students incur the
necessity of re-initiation, by the carrying of a dead body, except that
of their parents.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 884).—‘The religious student, even while
keeping the vows, does not deviate therefrom, if he burns the dead body
of his teacher, sub-teacher, preceptor, father or mother.’

*Devala* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 633).—‘Tho religious student shall not
perform such acts as the burning of the dead body; if he does do it, he
shall perform the *kṛohchra* penance and go through the initiation
again.’
