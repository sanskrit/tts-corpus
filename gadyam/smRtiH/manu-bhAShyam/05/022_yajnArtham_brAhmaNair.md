The commended beasts and birds may be killed by Brāhmaṇas for the purpose of sacrifice, and for the purpose of feeding their dependents; as Agastya did this of old.—(22).

In connection with food fit to be eaten, the Text proceeds to sanction
the act of killing.

If one’s dependents are very much pressed by hunger, and no other food
can be found, then one may kill such birds and beasts as are fit to be
eaten. The exact meaning of the term ‘dependent’ has been explained
before (as standing for parents, wife etc.)

The mention of Agastya—that Agastya did the act—is only by way of
recommendation.

The first half of the verse is purely commendatory; because the act of
killing in connection with sarcifices is directly enjoined by the Vedic
injunctions themselves (and as such does not stand in need of any
sanction from the present text).

‘*Commanded*’—*i.e*., permitted as lit to be eaten.

This same thing is slated in the next verse in greater detail, as
bearing upon the recommendation of certain acts.—(22).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.179) to the effect that just
as there is nothing wrong in the eating of meat which is the remnant of
sacrificial and Śrāddha offerings, so also there is none in eating that
which is left after the dependents have been fed.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 537), which adds that
animals are to he killed for feeding one’s dependents, only when there
is no other means of feeding them; and this implies also that there is
no harm in one’s eating the meat himself that is left after the feeding
of dependents;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 301).

**(verses 5.22-23)  
**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (4.5-8).—‘The Mānava text states:—“Only when he worships
Pitṛs and gods or honours guests, he may certainly slay animals: on
offering the honey-mixture to guests, and at rites in honour of Pitṛs
and gods and at a sacrifice,—on these occasions only may an animal be
slain.” The slaughter of animals at sacrifices is no slaughter. One may
cook a big ox or a big goat for a Brāhmaṇa or Kṣatriya guest.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.15).—‘It is declared in the Veda:—“At a sacrificial
session which lasted one thousand years, Agastya went out to hunt; he
had sacrificial cakes prepared with the meat of beasts and fowls good to
eat.”’

*Yājñavalkya* (Do.).—‘One who kills animals against the law, dwells in
terrible hell for as many years as there are hairs on the body of the
animal.’

*Yama and Paiṭhānaṣi* (Do.).—‘One should not kill any animal for his own
sake; if he cooks it for the sake of gods and Brāhmaṇas, he incurs no
sin,’

022	Beasts and birds recommended (for consumption) may be slain by Brahmanas for sacrifices, and in order to feed those whom they are bound to maintain; for Agastya did this of old.
