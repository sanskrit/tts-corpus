यान्य् एतानि द्वादशमलानि दर्शितानि । **नृ**ग्रहणं पञ्चनखानां प्रदर्शनार्थम् । श्वशृगालादीनां त्व् अस्पृश्यत्वाद् एव सिद्धम् । विण्मूत्रे तु सर्वस्याजाविकगवाश्वेभ्यो ऽन्यत्र ॥ ५.१३३ ॥

The twelve ‘excretions’ or ‘impurities’ are here indicated.

‘*Human beings*’ includes all *five-nailed* animals. As regards dogs and
jackals, their excretions are impure by reason of their own
untouchability.

‘Urine and ordure’—of all animals, except those of the goat, the sheep,
the cow and the horse.—(133).

(Verse 135 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 271), which explains ‘*karṇaviṭ*’
as ‘ear-wax’; and adds that these are ‘impure’ only when they have gone
out of the body, as is indicated by verse 132 above;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on
1.190);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 103), which adds the following
notes:—‘*vasā*’ is the oily substance in the body; ‘*asṛk*’ is blood;
‘*majjā*’ is the solidified fatty substance within the skull; ‘*dūṣikā*’
is the rheum of the eyes; ‘*karṇaviṭ*’ is ear-wax; the term ‘*nṛ*’ here
stands for *human* beings only, and not for all *living beings* (as the
root *nṛ*, ‘ to go,’ might imply); if the latter were meant, then the
term ‘*nṛṇām*’ would be entirely superfluous;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
794);—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 484);—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 347);—in
*Ācāramayūkha* (p. 14),—which explains ‘*dūṣikā*’ as *netramalam*’;—and
in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 303).

*Baudhāyana* \[(Do.) and Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 104\].—‘In the case of

water; but in that of the latter six one is purified by water only.’
