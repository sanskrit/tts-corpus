The term ‘*kha*’ stands for *organ*; hence the *organs of action* also
become included; and thus taking the two feet, the plural number becomes
justified in the phrase ‘*those that are below it are impure*.’

This explanation (by which the lower organs are all made *impure*) is
not right; as it is contrary to what has gone in the first half. Therein
it has been declared that the purity of those above the navel is of a
higher grade and superior: and this could have a meaning only if the
lower ones also were *pure*; for what is *while* cannot be called *more
black*.

Further, the term ‘*kha*’ does not signify the *organ*, it only
signifies the *cavity* or *hole*. It is for this reason that the organs
have been spoken of as ‘*saptaśirṣanyaḥ*’, ‘having seven seats’ (the
cavities of the two ears, two eyes, two nostrils and the mouth). There
are two ‘cavities’ below the navel; but the plural number has been used
on account of the male and female generative organs being regarded as
distinct.

According to this, there would be no uncleanliness of the hand involved
in touching the inside of the mouth;—but only if if does not come into
contact with the phlegm or other things that may be there. So. that if
the hand does become contaminated with some such defiling substance, the
mouth shall not be touched by it—(130).

(Verse 132 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 50);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 103), which explains ‘*khāni*’ as ‘cavities’ and adds that
(though there are only *two* cavities below the navel) the text uses the
plural ‘*tāni*’ by regarding the male and female generative organs as
distinct;—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 85), which explains ‘*khāni*’ as
‘holes’, ‘*medhyāni*’ as ‘clean’, and ‘*adhaḥ*’ as ‘below the navel’;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 842);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 359), which
explains ‘*medhyāni*’ as ‘touchable’, and ‘*amedhyāni*’ as ‘untouchable’
and ‘*dehachyuta-mala*’ as standing for the nails and other
excrescences, which also are ‘untouchable’.

*Viṣṇu* (3-51).—‘The cavities above the navel must bo considered pure;
those below it are impure; so are all excretions from the body.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.194).—‘Nor are excretions fallen from the human body
pure.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.10.19).—‘A man’s body is pure above the navel; it is
