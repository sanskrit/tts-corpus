She, who does not fail in her duty to her husband, having her thought, speech and body well-controlled, reaches her husband’s regions; and is called ‘good’ by all gentle-men.—(163).


By such conduct, the woman, having her thought, word and body well controlled, obtains excellent fame in this world, and also her husband’s region in the other world.—(164).

These verses sum up the duties of women; and these duties are easily
intelligible; hence I have devoted no attention to the explanation of
these.

The meaning of the teaching is as follows:—Though the man is permitted
(in 167) to take to another wife, yet that does not permit of the woman
taking another husband; because according to the injunction—‘she shall
not disregard him when he is dead’, there can be no possibility of her
marrying again; and by the assertion that ‘even childless persons go to
heaven’ it is made clear that the bearing of children, even in times of
distress, is forbidden. It is only in the *Smṛti* sanctioning ‘*Niyoga*’
that this latter is permitted. Hence in view of these (prohibition and
sanction) the two courses are regarded as optional alternatives; and
between these two *Smṛtis* we cannot determine which is superior and
which inferior; since one of them enjoins the bearing of children, and
the other clearly forbids it. Hence by taking them as optional
alternatives we make room for both—(163-164).

**(verse 5.163)**

(Verse 165 of others.)

It is not right to say that this and the next verse have been ‘omitted’
by Medhātithi, who says that he has not explained them as they are easy.
It is repeated in 9.29.

This is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 436);—and in *Varṣakriyākaumudī*
(p. 579).

**(verse 5.164)**

(Verse 166 of others.)

This is repeated in 9.30.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 436), which adds that what
is meant by ‘*patiloka*’ is that heavenly region which she has won for
herself by the religious rites she has performed in association with her
husband;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 67a).

well-behaved, with senses under control, attains fame in this world and
the supreme state, after death.’
