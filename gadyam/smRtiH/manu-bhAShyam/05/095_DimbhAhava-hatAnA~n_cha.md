Also in the case of those killed in a riot or Battle or by lightning or by the king; and of those who have died for the sake of cows and Brāhmaṇas; as also for the person for whom the king desires it.—(94).

‘*Ḍimba*’, ‘*Riot*’, is fighting done by many people, without weapons;
‘*Āhava*’ is battle.

In the case of persons killed in these, there is immediate purification.

‘*Lightning*’—This has been already explained.

‘*Pārthiva*’—the lord of the Earth, who may belong to any of the four
castes.

Also in the case of one who, even apart from battle, has been killed in
water, or by tusked animals,—for the sake of cows and *Brāhmaṇas*.

‘*Also for the person for whom the King desires it*;’—*i.e*. the person
who has been deputed by him to do a definite work.

*Question*:—“Why should this be so? In the case of the king himself,
immediate purification has been ordained only in reference to his work
of protecting the people; how then could the impurity of any and every
person, without any restriction, cease merely by the king’s desire?”

\[The answer to this is supplied by the next two verses\].—(94).

(Verse 95 of others.)

‘*Dimbāhava*’—a riot, or a fight without weapons (Medhātithi);—infants’
(Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 916), as laying down additional
cases for ‘immediate purity’; it explains ‘*dimbāhava*,’ as ‘weaponless
fight’;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 317), which takes
‘*āhavahata*,’ ‘killed in battle’ and remarks that this refers to
persons who have been killed ‘when fleeing from battle’, as otherwise
there would be no justification for the offerings to the dead described
in the Mahābhārata.

*Gautama* (14.9-12).—‘The relations of those who are slain for the sake
of cows and Brāhmaṇas become pure immediately; also those of men
destroyed by the anger of the king; of those killed in battle; likewise
those of men who voluntarily die by starving themselves, by weapons,
fire, poison or water, by hanging themselves or by jumping from a
precipice.’

*Viṣṇu* (22.47, 52).—‘The relatives of those who have been killed by
jumping from a precipice, or by fire or by fasting, or by water, in
battle, by lightning, or by the king, do not become impure; nor those
who perform the king’s orders, if the king wishes them to he pure.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 907).—‘The relatives of those killed in a riot, or
those of suicides, or of those who have been drowned in river or killed
by wild animals, become purified instantaneously.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do.).—‘For the relations of those killed in rots, or by
lightning, or by the king, or in the saving of cows and Brāhmaṇas, they
have declared instantaneous purification; but some sages have declared
that the impurity lasts three days.’

*Parāśara* (3.29-30).—‘For the relations of persons who have died for
the sake of Brāhmaṇas, or in the saving of prisoners or cows, and those
who have died in battle, the impurity lasts for one night.’

*Sumantu* (Aparārka, p. 917).—‘For those killed by jumping from a
precipice, or by ûre or water, or in battle,—those who die in foreign
lands, the renunciate—those killed by fasting, those killed by
lightning, or those who have committed suicide by going on the Great
Journey,—water-offerings may be made, and the purification is
instantaneous.’

*Kāśyapa* (Do.).—‘The relations of those killed by fasting or by
lightning, or by entering fire or water, by fall from a precipice, or in
battle, or in foreign land,—or of embryos, or of infants that have
teethed,—are purified in three nights.’
