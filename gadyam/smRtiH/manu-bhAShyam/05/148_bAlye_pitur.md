It has been declared thus—‘In the absence of any *sapiṇḍa-relation* of
her husband, some one on her father’s side shall be the woman’s
protector; on the total extinction of both families, the King has been
declared to be the woman’s guardian.’

This refers to a case where the husband is no more. (146).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 427);—and in

on terms of intimacy with any one other than her natural guardians
should be regarded as ‘lost.’
