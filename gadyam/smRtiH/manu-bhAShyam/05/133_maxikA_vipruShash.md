‘*Flies*’.—all sweat-born insects.

The ‘*cow*’ includes the goat and sheep.

The ‘*horse*’ includes the elephant and the mule.

The ‘*sun*’ includes all luminous bodies.

‘*Vipruṣaḥ*’, ‘*water-drops*’—such drops of water as are invisible and
can be felt only by touch.

‘*Shadow*’—of the *Cāṇḍāla* and other unclean things.

‘*Earth*’—in contact with, or walked over by, the Cāṇḍāla and the
like—is pure. In other cases its sweeping has been prescribed.

The flies &c. mentioned here, even though coming into contact with
ordure and other unclean things, do net become sources of defilement.

Another Smṛti-text says—‘Goats and horses are pure in their mouths; cows
are pure except in their mouths; cats and mongoose are touchable,—as
also other auspicious birds and animals’.—(131).

(Verse 133 of others.)

‘*Vipruṣaḥ*.’—‘Drops of water, invisible, but perceptible by touch only’
(Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘drops of saliva coming out of the mouth’
(Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 469), which adds the
following notes:—‘*makṣikā*’ includes all those insects whose touch
cannot be avoided;—‘*vipruṣaḥ*’ are those drops whose form is
invisible;—‘*chāyā*’—other than what is expressly forbidden;—‘*rajaḥ*’
other than what is expressly forbidden.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 296).

This verse is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 17a);—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 838);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (pp. 350 and 358), which says
that ‘*chāyā*’ stands for the shadow cast by persons *other than the
caṇḍāla*.
