By subsisting upon sacred fruits and roots, and by eating the food of hermits, one does not obtain that reward which he does by abstaining from meat—(54).

<details><summary>मेधातिथिः</summary>

**मेध्यैर्** देवार्हैः । **मुन्यन्नानि** नीवाराद्यन्नान्य् अकृष्टपच्यजनितानि । अयम् अर्थवाद एव ॥ ५.५४ ॥
</details>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Sacred*’—fit for Gods.

‘*Food of* *hermits*’—*i.e*., such grains as are got without
cultivation; *e.g*., the *Nirāra* and the like.

This verse also is a purely commendatory exaggeration—(54)
</details>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 719), which adds
that the renouncing of meat here spoken of refers to meat other than the
‘consecrated’ and the rest that have been spoken of before.

054	By subsisting on pure fruit and roots, and by eating food fit for ascetics (in the forest), one does not gain (so great) a reward as by entirely avoiding (the use of) flesh.
