What the injunction means is that the maiden married should be so much
younger than the man;—and not that marriage must be done only at. the
age stated. Nor is any stress meant to be laid upon the exact number of
years mentioned; all that is meant is that one should many a girl *very
much younger* than himself.

This injunction does not occur in the section dealing with Marriage;
hence, what is stated here cannot he regarded as a qualification of the
persons undergoing that sacrament, and consequently, as an essential
factor in the rite itself; for this same reason, it cannot be taken as
precluding the age of ‘ten’ or ‘twenty-five’ or such others.

“But it is often found that even though laid down in a distinct passage,
a detail does form an essential factor of an act”

True; but the very fact that the teacher has thought it fit to place the
present text apart from the section on marriage is clearly indicative of
the fact that he had some special purpose in this.

The practice of cultured men is also as we have stated.

Further, the age here stated can never be observed in the case of one’s
son marrying a second time; so that, if the injunction were meant to be
taken literally, it would mean that there should be no second marriage;
and this would be absurd.—(94)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 766), which says
that the following is the upshot of the texts bearing on this
subject:—If the age of the girl is 8 years or less, she should be
married to a man whose age is three times that of hers; if it is between
8 and 12, the age of the bidegroom should two and a half times;—if her
age is between 12 and 16 then that of the bridegroom shall be two years
less than the double of her age. Of the sentence ‘*dharme sīdati
satvaraḥ*,’ it gives two explanations:—(*a*) if he finds that his
religious duties would otherwise suffer, he may marry earlier; and (*b*)
if he marries in haste,—*i.e*., if he marries before he has reached the
prescribed age, or if he marries a girl whose age is lower than the one
prescribed,—then he suffers in spiritual merit

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 474), as laying down the
extent to which the bride should be younger than the bridegroom;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 121), which adds that this verse
applies to cases where the girl has not menstruated upto 12 years;—in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 215);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 82), which explains
‘*tryaṣṭavarṣaḥ*’ as ‘twenty-four years old’;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p.
801);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 112), which explains ‘*satvara*’
as ‘one of lower age,’ and deduces the conclusion that there is nothing
wrong if the girl is married before her menstruation;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 222), which explains ‘*satvaraḥ*’ as one
who is in a hurry to enter the Householder’s stage.’
