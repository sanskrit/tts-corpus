Exclusion from ‘*all religious acts*’ including exclusion from
‘entertainments’ and the rest also, those latter have been separately
mentioned, with a view to indicate the seriousness of the offence.

‘*Entertainments*’—dinner parties, musical parties and so forth.

‘*Sacrifices*’—*i.e*, helping them to perform sacrifices.

Similarly with ‘education.’

If the muling is ‘*asampāṭhyavigarhitāḥ*’—the compound would be
‘*asampāṭhya* and *avigarhita*,’ ‘excluded from education and
undespised.’

‘*Abject*’—*i.e*., even though possessed of wealth, they shall live on
alms, and shall be clothed in rags and so forth (?).—(238)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 635), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Asambhojyāḥ*’, *i.e*., people should not join with
them in any convivial gatherings;—‘*asampāṭhyāḥ*’, they are unfit for
teaching;—‘*asamyājyāḥ*’, unfit for sacrificing;—‘*avivāhinaḥ*’, not
entitled to marry;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 116);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 37), to the effect that one who has committed a
‘heinous’ crime is not entitled to any of the acts to which the
twice-born are entitled.
