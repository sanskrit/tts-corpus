‘*Treasury*’—the place where the king’s riches are stored; those who rob
this are to be put to death, irrespectively of the quality or quantity
of the property stolen.

Those also who behave disaffectedly towards him;—for instance, those who
obstruct the king’s attempts to import such rare foreign articles, as
the coal-black horse which is rare for Easterners, or the elephant,
which is rare for the Northerners,—or try to turn his friends into
enemies, and try to bring about an alliance of these with his
enemies,—and thus ‘*conspire with his enemies*’— and egg them on;—these
he shall put to death.

It has been already explained that since the penalty is meant for the
accomplishment of a definite purpose of the King, it need not always be
actual *death*.—(275)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 853), which notes that ‘*rājñaḥ*’
is to be construed with each of the other terms;—again on p. 864, it
adds the following notes:—‘*Upajāpakāḥ*’ supporters,—‘*Vividhaiḥ
daṇḍaiḥ*’ *i.e*. every form of punishment should be inflicted in
accordance with the nature of the offence.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.302), which explains ‘*vividhaiḥ
daṇḍaiḥ*’ as ‘such penalties as confiscation of the entire property,
cutting off of limbs and death;’—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 367), which
explains ‘*koṣa*’ as the ‘king’s amassed wealth’,—and ‘*upajāpakān*’ as
persons creating dissension in the kingdom (among the *soldiers*,
‘*virāṇām*’ which is its reading for ‘*arīṇām*’);—in *Vyavahāramayūkha*
(p. 110);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahara, p. 395);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 991);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra
225b).

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 368).—‘Those who are addicted to
amusements reserved for the King, those who take upon themselves the
functions of the King, and those who talk ill of the King, all these
shall suffer corporal punishment.—Those who assume the appearance of the
King, those who amuse themselves during the hours of work, those who
extort exorbitant taxes, and those who steal the King’s wealth,—should
suffer diverse forms of corporal punishment.’

*Viṣṇu* (Do., p. 369).—‘Those who, not belonging to the royal family,
seek to obtain the kingdom should be put to death.’

*Vyāsa* (Parāśaramādhava-Vyavahāra, p. 395).—‘Those Judges who, on
receiving bribes, decide a case unjustly, those who injure the King’s
property, those who live on bribes,—these the King shall banish, after
having confiscated all their property.’
