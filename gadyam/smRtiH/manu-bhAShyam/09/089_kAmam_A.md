As a rule, the girl should be given away before puberty; but even after
puberty, the father should not give her away until a qualified
bridegroom has been found.

‘*Qualities*’— such as a high degree of learning, bravery, physical
beauty, right age, being averse to doing acts forbidden by custom and
scriptures, love for the bride; and so forth.—(89)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 93), which adds that what is
meant is that ‘so long as a man with good qualifications is not
available she shall not be given to one devoid of qualifications,’ and
not that there is nothing wrong, under the circumstances, to keep the
girl unmarried even after puberty; as this latter view is contrary to
other texts.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 124), which adds that all that is
meant is that the girl should not be given to a man devoid of
qualifications;—in *Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 38);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 804),
which says that what is meant is that ‘she should not be given to a man
without qualifications when a qualified man is available,’ and it is not
meant that a girl should never be given to a man without
qualifications;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 216), which has the
same note;—in *Saṃskāraratnamāla* (p. 456), which also has the same
note;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 102), which says that ‘*api*’ and
‘*kāmam*’ indicate that the verse is not to be taken in its literal
sense; all that is meant is to eulogise the marrying of the girl to a
qualified man.

089	(But) the maiden, though marriageable, should rather stop in (the father's) house until death, than that he should ever give her to a man destitute of good qualities.
