Here also the term ‘daughter’s son’ is to be understood as standing for
the *son of the. Appointed Daughter*.

‘*The daughters son, like the son’s son, saves the man* *in* *the next
world*’;—this is purely declamatory;—the fact having been already
enjoined before ([in
133]).

Between these two ‘*there is no difference*’;—in the case of one (the
son’s son), it is the mother, while in that of the other (the daughter’s
son) it is the father, that belongs to another family. Hence the
daughter’s son also delivers one from the aforesaid *Put-hell*.—(139)

It is quoted in *Dāyakramasaṅgraha* (p. 25);—in *Dattakamīmānsā* (p.
40);—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*.
