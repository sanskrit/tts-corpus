When a woman is united in one form with a man possessed of certain qualities, she becomes herself endowed with similar qualities,—like a river united with the ocean.—(22)

भार्यासंरक्षणकामेन दौःशील्याद् आत्मा रक्षितव्यः । नाप्य् एतयैव केवलया । यतो[^७४] दुःशीलस्य भार्यापि तथाविधैर् भवति, गुणवतः शीलवती । यथा **समुद्रेण निम्नगा** नदी संयुज्यमाना क्षारोदका भवति मधुररसापि सती ॥ ९.२२ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

If a man wishes to guard his wife, he should guard himself also against
evil habits; and it is not the woman that should preserve her chastity.
Since if the man has a bad character, his wife also becomes the same;
just as the wife of a man possessed of good character becomes good. For
instance the river, though herself sweet-watered, becomes saline like
the Ocean, when she joins this latter.—(22)

आत्मसंयमनेनाप्य् एताः शक्या रक्षितुं मनुष्येणेत्य् उपायान्तरनिर्देशः । न केवलम् असंयततयात्मानम् एवोपहन्ति मनुष्याः, किं तर्हि स्त्रिया अप्य् उपघात एवंवृत्तो वर्तत इत्य् अस्यार्थस्य निदर्शनम् ॥ ९.२२ ॥

022	Whatever be the qualities of the man with whom a woman is united according to the law, such qualities even she assumes, like a river (united) with the ocean.
