If brothers, living together, after having divided once, happen to make a second partition, the division in that case shall be equal; in such cases there is no ‘primogeniture.’—(210)

स्पष्टार्थः श्लोकः । विभागधर्मे विभागस्योद्धारप्रत्याशङ्कानिवृत्त्यर्थम्, "अपित्र्य इति धारणा" (म्ध् ९.२०५) इति वचनात् । पित्र्यस्य सर्वधनस्योद्धारः । इह तु भूतपूर्वगत्या[^५५८] पित्र्यं नस्तीत्याशङ्कया वचनम् ॥ ९.२१० ॥

The meaning of the verse is quite clear. It is meant to forbid the
‘preferential share’ which would appear to be the standing rule in
connection with all partition; specially in view of what has been said
above (205) regarding ‘the property being not acquired by the
father’(205). It is only out of all kinds of property *acquired by the
father* that there is to be a ‘preferential share.’ In the present case,
however, the property might in a sense be regarded as ‘acquired by the
father,’ and hence, the possibility of the ‘preferential share,’—which,
therefore, has had to be expressly denied.—(210)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.139);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
678), to the effect that in the case noted there is no unequal
division;—in *Aparārka* (p. 748), which adds that this prohibits only
that unequal division, which is in the form of additional shares for the
eldest brother,—and not other kinds of unequal division; so that each
brother obtains, on partition, that part of the property which was his
when they entered into joint life.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 601), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Saha jīvantaḥ*’, living after joining together,—‘*samastatra
vibhāgaḥ*’, *i.e*., there is to be no additional share for the eldest,
and so forth.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 65), which mentions two
opinions—one, is that which has been set forth in *Aparārka*, and
another that there is to be absolutely equal division all round;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 41b);—by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p.
342), which says that the equal partition is meant for brothers of the
same caste as the father;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 210a), which
explains the implication of the last clause to be that there is no
unequal division *due to seniority*, but there is unequal division on
other grounds.

*Viṣṇu* (18.41).—‘If brothers, who after a previous division of the
estate, live again together as parceners, should make a second
partition, the shares must be equal in that case; and the eldest has no
right to an additional share.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.120).—‘When a property has been acquired by several
brothers in common, it shall be shared equally by all.’

*Bṛhaspati* (25.73).—‘When brothers formerly divided are again living
together through affection, and arrange a second partition, the right of
primogeniture does not accrue in that case.’

210	If brothers, (once) divided and living (again) together (as coparceners), make a second partition, the division shall in that case be equal; in such a case there is no right of primogeniture.
