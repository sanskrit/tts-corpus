Of the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya, the son born of a Śūdra wife is not an inheritor of property; his property shall consist of whatever his father may give to him.—(155)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The son born of the *Śūdra* wife of the twice-born persons is not
an^(‘)inheritor of property.’—Is that so always?—No; ‘*whatever* *his*
*father may give to him*’—*i.e*., the ‘tenth part’ which the father may
have allotted to him—that shall be his property; and he obtains nothing
more out of his paternal property.

In this connection, it has been declared by Śaṅkha—‘The son of the Śūdra
wife is not entitled to inheritance;—his share consists of whatever his
father gives him; *at the time of partition, however, his brothers may
give him a pair of bullocks in addition*’;—this latter sentence forming
a subsequent addition.

Others hold that what is said in the present text refers to the son of
the *unmarried Śūdra* woman;—their argument being that there is nothing
in the text indicative of the woman being one that has been duly
married,—all that the term ‘*Śūdra*’ denotes is the particular caste.
Hence, the meaning is that for the son of such a woman, ‘*whatever the
father gives him*,’—that is, the provision that his father makes for his
maintenance, or any share that he may have allotted to him for his
maintenance during his life-time,—that shall be his property,—and his
brothers need not give him anything. Says Gautama in the section dealing
with the son of a *Śūdra* wife—‘As regards the sons of unmarried wives,
they shall, if they are obedient, receive enough for subsistence, in the
manner of pupils.’ (28—39)

According to the view of these men, however, the sons born of unmarried
*Kṣatriya* and *Vaiśya* wives would be entitled to inheritance; and it
is not known to what share these would be entitled.

It might be asserted that—“Their share shall be the same as that of the
sons of married wives; since there is no word, either directly or
indirectly indicative of the fact that the mothers shall be *married*
wives. For all that is said is that—‘the legitimate son alone shall
inherit the property’ (163); which distinctly mentions the ‘legitimate’
son, born of the legally married wife *↓* and the qualities of the
‘legitimate’ son can never be present in those born of *unmarried*
wives, and further, it has been declared that ‘the son of the
unauthorised woman...... is not entitled to any share’ (143). It might
be urged that this last passage refers to the *brothers wife*; as it is
only in connection with her that ‘authorisation’ has been sanctioned; so
that when the text used the term ‘unauthorised’ it must be taken as
referring to her alone.”

But in the present case also, there is dear indication of the fact that
sons become entitled to ‘subsistence’ as soon as they are born
(irrespectively of all other conditions). Hence, the term ‘unauthorised’
also refers in general to the wives of other persons. And all these sons
(of married or unmarried wives) are entitled to subsistence.—(155)

“The son of a Śūdra wife receives no share of his father’s estate in
case the mother was not legally married’ (Medhātithi; ‘others,’ in
Kullūka),—or in case he is destitute of good qualities (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda). According to Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa ‘*na rikthabhāk*’
means ‘receives no larger share than one-tenth, except if the father has
given more to him.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 535), which adds the
following notes:—‘According to *Lakṣmīdhara* the meaning is that ‘if the
father gives anything to the son of his Śūdra wife, he should give only
the tenth part of his property’;—Halāyudha and Pārijāta hold that the
verse denies all share to the son of the Śūdra mother who is not a
married wife.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 343); which adds that
this refers only to such property as may be given by way of an
affectionate present; and hence there is no incompatibility with those
texts that deny to the said son any part of the landed property.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 735), which notes that this debarring
from inheritance is meant for those cases where the son in question has
already received some affectionate presents from the father;—or that the
verse may be taken to mean that the son is not entitled to anything more
than the tenth share of the property.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 45) as debarring from all
inheritance the son of a *śūdra* mother, who is not a legally married
wife;—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 219), which says that this
denial of heritance refers only to those cases where the śūdra son has
already got the tenth part of the father’s property, during the latter’s
life-time, through his favour.
