[(See the texts under
31-44.)]

*Parāśara* (1.16).—(Same as Manu.)

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 580).—‘If the seed is sown by a
stranger in a soil without the knowledge of the owner of the soil, it
belongs to the owner of the soil.’

*Nārada* (Do., p. 581).—‘There can be no crops without the soil, nor is
there any crop without the seed; hence the child is held to belong to
both the father and the mother.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Do. p. 557).—‘The child belongs to the person who
married the girl with *mantras*,—says Aṅgiras: but Uśanas says that when
the seed has been sown with the consent of both the owner of the soil
and the owner of the seed, the product belongs to both.’

*Hārita* (Do.).—‘No soil is productive without the seed, nor does the
seed grow without the soil, hence the child belongs to both—say some
people.’
