प्रतिलोमविवाहः[^४६२] शूद्रस्य नेष्यते । उक्तानुवादो ऽयम् । **तस्यां जाताः समांशाः स्युर्** इति । पञ्चमस्य जात्यन्तरस्याभावाद् एवम् उक्तम् । सवर्णैव तस्य भार्या नान्यास्तीति ॥ ९.१५७ ॥

For the *Śūdra* there is no irregular wife of the ‘ascending’ degree.

This is only a reiteration of what has been said before.

‘*Other sons born of her shall be entitled to equal shares*.’

It is in view of there being no fifth caste that, the text has said that
‘for the Śūdra there is a wife of the same caste, *and no other*.’—(157)

This Verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 532);—and in *Smṛtitattva*
II (p. 193), which quotes and accepts the explanation given by Kullūka
that this is meant to preclude the ‘additional share’ prescribed in the
preceding verse.
