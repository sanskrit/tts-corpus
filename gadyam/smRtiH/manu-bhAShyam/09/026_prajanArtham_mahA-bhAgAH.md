*Question*.—“In what way is the duty towards children conducive to
happiness, since children are dependent upon the man himself, and women,
being beset with many defects, deserve to be abandoned? And who is there
who would be willing to maintain all these in his house?”

It is with a view to set aside such notions that we have the present
verse.

In as much as the defects of women are capable of rectification, they
are ‘*worthy of worship*’. When the above-mentioned verses dilated upon
the defects of women, it was not with a view to discredit them, or to
make people avoid them; it was done with this view that they may be
guarded against evil. Simply because there are beggars, people do not
give up cooking their food; or because there are deer to graze them,
people do not desist from sowing seeds.

‘*Bearing children*’—stands for the whole series of acts beginning with
conception and ending with fostering and bringing them up: as is going
to be said below (27)—‘Begetting of children and nourishing of those
that are born’.

They are like effulgence in their home. It is well-known that there is
no comfort at home, in the absence of the wife. Even when there is
plenty of wealth, if the wife is absent, the household is not able to
attend to the feeding and other needs of friends and relatives that may
happen to come in as guests. In fact, they are as powerless as poor men.

For this reason there is no difference between the Goddess of Fortune
and women in their homes.—(26)

**(verses 9.26-27)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (13.40.11).—‘One who desires his own prosperity should
always honour women; O Bhārata, when the woman is loved and also held in
restraint, she becomes the Goddess of Prosperity herself.’

026	Between wives (striyah) who (are destined) to bear children, who secure many blessings, who are worthy of worship and irradiate (their) dwellings, and between the goddesses of fortune (sriyah, who reside) in the houses (of men), there is no difference whatsoever.
