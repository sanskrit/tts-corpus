‘*Restraint*’—such as, avoiding the house of others, in the absence of
her husband, as she does when he is present ‘*Devoted*’—fixed,
observing.

When he has gone without making provision for her, she should subsist by
industries;—such as, spinning, lace-making and the like. The
‘*objectionable*’ industries are the making of fans and such things.

These are the means of subsistence for widows, depending upon their own
labour.—(75)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 438), which explains the
construction as ‘*vṛttim vidhāya proṣiie*;’ and explains ‘*jīvet*’ as
‘should maintain herself by the means provided for her by her husband.’
