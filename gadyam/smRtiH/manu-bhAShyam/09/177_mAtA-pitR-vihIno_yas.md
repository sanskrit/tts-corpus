This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 738), which explains that the
‘*Kāraṇa*’, cause, for abandoning, consists in the child having become
an *out-cast*,—and ‘*sparśayet*’, offers, *surrenders*.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 571), which has the following
notes:—‘*Akāraṇāt*’, without fault,—‘*ātmānam sparśayet*’ should offer
himself with the words,—‘I am your son—in the *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 38);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 38a);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 546);—in *Śrāddhakriyakaumudī* (p. 455);—in
*Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 92);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 1(?)89b),
which says that the abandoning of the child should be only because of
inability to support it, and not by reason of the child having become an
out-cast and so forth.
