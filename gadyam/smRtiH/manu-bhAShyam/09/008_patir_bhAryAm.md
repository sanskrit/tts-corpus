The husband, entering the womb of his wife, becomes the embryo and is then born; the wife-hood of the ‘wife’ consists in this that the husband is re-born of her.—(8).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is a purely declamatory passage. As a matter of fact, the husband
is never found to enter the womb of his wife; and it is the entrance of
the semen, the very essence of his body, into the wife’s womb, which is
figuratively called his own ‘*entering*’. The Mantra also says—‘You are
my own self, called by the name of *son*’.

The real basis of the denotation of the term ‘wife’, ‘*jāyā*’, is that
the husband *is re-born of her*.

The application of the name^(‘)*jāyā*’, ‘wife’ being based upon the fact
of the woman giving birth to the child, she comes to be spoken of as the
‘wife’ of her paramour also.—(8).
