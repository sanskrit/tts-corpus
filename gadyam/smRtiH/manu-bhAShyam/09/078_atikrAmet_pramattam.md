<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Disregarding*’ means neglect of his service, omitting to look after
his medication and diet; it does not stand for having recourse to
another man.

The ‘abandoning’ for three months also stands only for the omitting of
endearing caresses, etc., for reasons already given.

She shall be deprived of ‘*ornaments*’, such as necklaces, bracelets and
so forth;—‘*and of appurtenances*’—such as vessels, water-jars, slaves
and slave-girls, etc., etc.—(78)
