This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 582);—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
300) as attributing the character of the regular ‘son’ to the son of the
co-wife;—in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 187);—again on p. 388, where
‘*ekapatnīnām*’ is expounded as ‘*ekaḥ patiḥ yāsām*’;—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 97);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 459 and 465), to the
effect that a woman’s property is inherited (1) by her son, (2) by her
grandson, (3) by her great-grandson, (4) by her daughter and (5) by her
step-son; and also as entitling the step-son to do the ‘*sapiṇḍana*,’
‘amalgamating,’ Śrāddha for his step-mother;—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p.
76), to the effect that the step-son is as good as a son;—in
*Dattakamīmāṃsā* (p. 14), to the effect that the *step-son* is a ‘son’,
even without being ‘appointed’, because he is constituted by the
elements of her own husband’s body;—in *Dattakacandrikā* (p. 50);—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 200), to the effect that if a woman has no son of
her own, her afterdeath rites are to be performed by her step-son;—in
*Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 103);—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 668).
