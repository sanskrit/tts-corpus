As the man to whom the woman clings, so the offspring that she brings forth; hence for the sake of the purity of the offspring one should carefully guard the woman.—(9).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The present text proceeds to explain what has been said in verse 7.

One should not entertain the idea that what is meant is—either (1) that
‘the woman brings forth a child of *the same caste* as that of the other
man to whom she clings’, or (2) that ‘the child born resembles that man
in his qualities’; because the child born of a *Śūdra* is a *caṇḍāla*’
and so forth. Even in the case of the parties belonging to the same
caste, the caste of the child is not the same as that of the father;
since it has been declared that ‘the child should be born of a woman of
untouched womb’. If again, the child were to resemble the father in
qualities, it would mean that the text permits the woman whose husband
is poor and of bad character to have recourse to another man possessed
of better qualities.

If, on the other hand, the text is taken as purely declamatory, the
sense of the assertion, ‘as the man so the child’ comes to be that ‘the
child born is not endowed with the qualities of the family’.—(9).

009	As the male is to whom a wife cleaves, even so is the son whom she brings forth; let him therefore carefully guard his wife, in order to keep his offspring pure.
