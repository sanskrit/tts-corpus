‘*Learning*’—teaching, *etc*., as also proficiency in an art.

‘*Friendly presents*’—Presents received from friends.

‘*Marriage—presents*’—in the shape of dowry and the like.

‘*In connection with the honey-mixture*’—*i.e*., in consideration of
priestly functions. Though this also is a ‘gain of learning,’ yet it has
been mentioned separately, because it is obtained by means of the
special kind of work of officiating at sacrifices.

‘*Marriage*—*presents*’—stand for all that is received from the
father-in-law’s house. Others explain it to mean any presents that are
made to one in connection with his marriage.—(206)

“Instances in which land was given as *Vidyādhana* occur in the
inscriptions, see, *e.g*. Indian Antiquary XII, p. 195b, l. 6.”—Buhler.

‘*Audvāhikam*’—Nandana is misrepresented by Buhler; he says nothing
about ‘*strīdhana*’ here.—‘What is received at one’s marriage from the
bride’s relatives’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa),—or ‘from anybody’
(Medhātithi, ‘others’).

‘*Mādhuparkikam*’.—‘Fee given for a sacrificial per formance’
(Medhātithi);—‘any present, *e.g*., a silver vase, received along with
the Honey-mixture’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 499), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Vidyādhana*’ and ‘*audvāhika*’ are going to be
described later on,—‘*Maitra*’ is what isobtained from a
friend,—‘*Mādhuparkikam*’ is what is obtained as a mark of respect at
the time of the offering of the Honey-mixture,—‘*tasyaiva bhavet*’
should be impartible;—in *Dāyakramasaṅgraha* (p. 35);—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 476).

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 55);—in *Aparārka* (p. 724), to
the effect that what one has acquired entirely by his learning he shall
not give to his co-sharers;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 135),
which explains ‘*maitram*’ as ‘what has been obtained as a friendly
present’;—and ‘*Mādhuparkikam*’ as the *arhaṇā* offerings received at
the time of *Madhuparka-offering*;—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, pp.
168 and 179).
