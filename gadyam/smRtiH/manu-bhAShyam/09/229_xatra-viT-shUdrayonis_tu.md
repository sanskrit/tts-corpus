क्षत्रियादयो निर्धना न संबन्धेनावसादयितव्याः[^५८६] । किं तर्हि, **कर्मणा** यद् यस्योचितं कर्म राजोपयोगि तेन दण्डधनं संशोधयितव्याः । ब्राह्मणस् तु कुऋउम्बानाम् अविरोधेन **शनैर्** दाप्यः । बन्धताडनकर्मणी तस्य निषिध्येते । धनिकविषयः प्रागुक्तः श्लोकः । दण्डविषयो ऽयम् । अपौनरुक्त्यम् ॥ ९.२२९ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The *Kṣatriya* and the rest, when devoid of property, should not be
harassed by imprisonment; they should make good the amount of fine due
to the king ‘by *labour*’,—such work as may be in keeping with the
character of the man, and profitable to the king.

The Brāhmaṇa shall be made to pay it ‘*by instalments*’—so that his
family may not suffer from want. Imprisonment, beating and such
chastisements are forbidden for the Brāhmaṇa.

What has been laid down before pertains to the repayment of the debt to
the debtor, while the present verse pertains to the payment of fines.
There is thus no repetition.—(229)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 658), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Karmaṇā*,’ by such service as may be a proper
recompense for the money owed;—the Brāhmaṇa is not to liquidate the debt
by service; he must pay it off, by and bye;—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 880).

*Yājñavalkya* (2.43).—‘If a man of the lower castes is very much reduced
in circumstances, he should be made to do work, towards repayment of the
debt; but the Brāhmaṇa should never be made to work; he should be made
to pay up gradually, as he goes on getting money.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Aparārka, p. 616).—‘If the debtor has absolutely no wealth,
he should be brought home and made to work; but the Brāhmaṇa should be
made to repay the debt gradually.’

यथोक्तं दण्डप्रकारम् अशक्नुवन्तो निर्धनत्वात् क्षत्रियादयो दण्डानुरूपाणि कर्माणि कुर्युः । ब्राह्मणस् तु स्वधर्मानुरोधेन **शनैः शनैर्** दण्डनीयः । तद् एतद् उक्तम् अप्य् अधुना पुनर् उच्यते दण्डविषयार्थम् । पूर्वं तु कुसीदप्रकरणे तद्गतम् ॥ ९.२२९ ॥
