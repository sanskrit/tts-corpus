Fire sprang from water, the Kṣatriya from the Brāhmaṇa, and iron from stone; the all-penetrating force of each of these becomes extinguished in its source.—(321)

**अद्भ्य**[^७७६] ओषधिवनस्पतिभ्य एव जायत इत्य् एवम् **अग्निर्** अद्भ्य एव उत्पन्नः । तस्य **सर्वगं** **तेजः** सर्वदाह्यं दहति, तेजसाभिभवति । अपः प्राप्य तद् अस्य तेजः **शाम्यति** । **अश्मनो लोहं** खड्गादि । तेन सर्वं विदार्यते, अश्मसंपातात् स्फुटति । एवं क्षत्रियाः सर्वत्र जिगीषवो विजयन्ते, ब्राह्मणेषु चेद् औद्धत्येन वर्तन्ते तदा विनश्यन्ति ॥ ९.३२१ ॥

‘*From water*’—*i.e*., from herbs anil trees—springs fire; that is why
it is named ‘*agni*.’ *The* ‘*all-penetrating force*’ of this is that
which burns all that can be burnt; and yet when it reaches water, it
becomes extinguished.

‘*From stone spiring iron*’—in the shape of the sword and other weapons.
It tears everything; and yet when it falls on stone it breaks and
becomes blunted.

Similarly *Kṣatriyas* conquer everywhere; but when they behave
arrogantly towards the *Brāhmaṇa*, they are ruined.

“According to Rāghavānanda the statement that the Kṣatriyas sprang from
the Brāhmaṇas is based on a Vedic passage. But Nārāyaṇa thinks that it
alludes to a Paurāṇika story, according to which the Brāhmaṇas produced
with the Kṣatriya females a new Kṣatriya race after the destruction of
the second *varṇa* by Paraśurāma.”—Buhler.

This verse is found in the Mahābhārata 5.15.34; 12.56.24.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 152).

321	Fire sprang from water, Kshatriyas from Brahmanas, iron from stone; the all-penetrating force of those (three) has no effect on that whence they were produced.
