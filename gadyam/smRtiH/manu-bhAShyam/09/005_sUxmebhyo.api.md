‘*Attachment*’— association, with a woman of unknown character,—one who
is in the habit of standing at the doorway, looking at gaily dressed
young men passing by, and so forth.

The meaning is that they should be guarded against temptations. Even
though the acts mentioned above,—*i,e*. gazing at young men and so forth
are not wrong in themselves, nor is the association of women with women
wrong in itself.

\*         \*         \*     
   \*         \*       
 \*

Against these they should be ‘*guarded*’; they should be checked.

‘*Specialty*’ with particular care.

\*         \*         \*     
   \*         \*       
 \*

Thus the meaning is that the woman should be guarded by all the men of
the family, her brother, father, brother-in-law, and the rest.

\*         \*         \*     
   \*         \*

**(verses 9.5-7)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (3.12.68).—

*Hārīta* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 410).—‘One must guard one’s wife against
sensual contact, as the ruin of the wife involves the ruin of the
family; the ruin of the family involves the ruin of the line; the ruin
of the line involves the ruin of all offerings to gods and Pitṛs; the
ruin of offerings involves the ruin of Dharma; the ruin of Dharma leads
to the ruin of the soul; and the ruin of the soul means the loss of all
things.’

*Paiṭhīnaśi* (Do., p. 411).—‘For these reasons, one must guard one’s
wife: lest there he a confusion of castes.’

*Bṛhaspati* (24-2).—(See under 2.)

005	Women must particularly be guarded against evil inclinations, however trifling (they may appear); for, if they are not guarded, they will bring sorrow on two families.
