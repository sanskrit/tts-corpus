शासनं यथाशास्त्रं वधादिदण्डम् अन्तरेण तस्कराणां निग्रहो[^६५०] रक्षा च[^६५१] न शक्यते । अतो वृत्तिं गृहीत्वा यस् तस्करवधाज् जुगुप्सते तस्योभयो दोषः, इह राष्ट्रकृतः, अमुत्र स्वर्गपरिहानिः । युक्ता च बलिपरिगृहीतस्य तन्निष्कृतिम् अकुर्वतो दोषवत्ता ॥ ९.२५४ ॥

‘*Repression*’;—the punishment of thieves and others according to rules
laid down in the Scriptures—by the inflicting of corporal and other
forms of punishment;—without which the protection of the people is not
possible.

Hence if the king receives taxes and yet fights shy of repressing
thieves, he incurs the two dangers—in this world, trouble in his
kingdom, and in the next, the loss of Heaven. It is only right that
blame should attach to the King who receives taxes and yet does not
repay it by service.—(254)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 294), which adds that the
subject of ‘*parihīyate*’ is ‘*rājā*’, the king;—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 80), which says that ‘*parihīyate*’ is
to be construed with ‘*saḥ*’ understood.
