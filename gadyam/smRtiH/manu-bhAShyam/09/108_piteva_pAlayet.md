They should be supported like sons; but they shall not be deprived of
wealth, on the ground of their being of younger age.

They also should look upon him as their father; this is what is meant by
the sentence.—‘*They shall behave like sons*.’— (108)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 457), which adds the
following explanation:—The eldest brother should take care of the
younger brothers, as if he were their father, and he should not separate
them;—‘*putravat varteran*’, they should not entertain feelings of
hatred towards him;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 513, 656 and
691);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 90), as attributing the qualities
of father and son to the elder and younger brothers respectively;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 172a).

108	As a father (supports) his sons, so let the eldest support his younger brothers, and let them also in accordance with the law behave towards their eldest brother as sons (behave towards their father).
