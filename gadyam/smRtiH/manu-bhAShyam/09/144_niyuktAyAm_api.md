‘*Not in the prescribed* *manner*;’—*i.e*., not wearing the white dress
and observing such details.

He is not entitled to the property; *i.e*., he shall not be treated as
the ‘*Kṣetraja*’ son.

The brother-in-law ‘and the sister-in-law are both rightly regarded as
‘outcasts,’ on account of their having not obeyed the restrictions, in
the begetting of the son; since what is permitted by the scriptures is
only such intercourse as is done in strict accordance with the rules
laid down.—(144)
