‘*High officials*’—Such as ministers, priests and other attendants of
the king;—if they ‘misbehave,’ act improperly.

‘*Physicians*’—Medical practitioners.

‘*Art-exhibitors*’—Picture-painters, decorators, cooks and so forth; who
show before people the product of their arts, and make a living by it.

‘*misbehaving*’ goes with all the terms.—(259)

‘*Mahāmātra*’.—‘Courtiers’ (Medhātithi);—‘Ministers’
(Nārāyaṇa);—‘elephant-drivers’ (Kullūka).

‘*Śilpopacārayuktāḥ*’.—‘Men living by such arts as painting and the
like’ (Medhātithi and Kullūka);—Nārāyaṇa and Nandana, read
‘*śilpopakārayuktāḥ*’ and explain it as people living by *śilpa*, the
arte of painting and the rest, and by *upakāra*, hairdressing and other
arts of the toilet; Nandana explains it as ‘umbrella and fanmakers’.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 291), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Asamyak-kāriṇaḥ*,’ who obtained their wages without
honestly working for it;—‘*mahāmātrāḥ*,’ chief officers of the king *who
act dishonestly* (*asamyak-kāriṇaḥ*) through avarice.
