These and others of the same kind one should know as the open ‘thorns’ of the people; and others, who are rogues in the guise of gentlemen, as ‘dissemblers.’—(260)

‘*Others of the same kind*’— It is not possible to enumerate each and
every kind of rogue addicted to robbing other persons; hence this
phrase;—*e.g*., there is one class of men who come and tell a man who is
stricken with a certain woman that she is in love with him, though in
reality she hates him; and another who, though not a servant, behaves as
if he were one, and thus robs a simple-minded man of his gold; others
again who flatter the foolish rich with such words as ‘you are Brahmā,’
‘you are Bṛhaspati’ and cheat them out of their riches; telling him —‘
kindly give me such and such a thing, I shall repay it in a few days’;
and as soon as their business is accomplished, they become scarce, and
hitherto smooth-tongued, become harsh.—(260)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 291), which explains
‘*anāryānāryaliṅginaḥ*’ as ‘persons who, while not being real religious
students, pretend to be such and make money by it’.

260	These and the like who show themselves openly, as well as others who walk in disguise (such as) non-Aryans who wear the marks of Aryans, he should know to be thorns (in the side of his people).
