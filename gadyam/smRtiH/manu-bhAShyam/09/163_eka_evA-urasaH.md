If the legitimate son is there, all the others ‘*Kṣetraja*’ a nd the
rest—are not ‘heirs;’ and they shall receive a subsistence allowance
only from the legitimate son ‘Avoidance of unkindness’—avoidance of sin.
That is the man would incur sin if he did not make the said
provision.—(163)

‘*Pradadyāt jīvanam*’.—‘And if one does not maintain them, he commits
sin’ (Medhātithi and Kullūka),—‘but not, if they have other means of
subsistence’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.132), which notes that this rule
is meant for those cases where the ‘adopted’ and other ‘secondary’ sons
are either not friendly towards the ‘body-born’ son, or entirely devoid
of good qualities. The *Bālambhaṭṭī* has the following
notes:—‘*ānṛśaṃsya*’ means ‘avoidance of sin’; so that the meaning is
that if maintenance is not provided, sin is incurred.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 542), which has the following
notes:—‘*Śeṣāṇām*’, those precluded from inheritance;—‘*ānṛśaṃsya*’ is
pity,—‘*prajīvanam*’, maintenance;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p.
348), which adds that the verse is meant to be a mere eulogium on the
‘body-born’ son, it does not really preclude the fourth share for the
other sons;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 40a);—

in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 149), which explains ‘*ānṛśaṃśyam*’
as ‘pity’, and ‘*prajīvanam*’ as ‘maintenance’;—and by Jīmūtavāhana,
(*Dāyabhāga*, p. 229).

*Viṣṇu* (15.28-30).—‘A mongst these sons, each preceding one is
preferable to the one next in order;—he takes the inheritance before the
next in order;—and he shall maintain the others.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.132).—‘Among them, the succeeding one is entitled to
offer the Ball and inherit the property only in the absence of the
preceding one.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 541).—‘The Body-horn son alone has been
declared to be the owner of the father’s property; equal to him is the
Appointed Daughter; the other sons should be supported.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Do., p. 545).—‘The Body-born son, even though low-born,
is the owner of the entire property.’
