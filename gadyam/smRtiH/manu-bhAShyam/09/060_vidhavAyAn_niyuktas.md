No significance is meant to be attached to the mention of the.
‘*widow*’; as the rule laid down here is applicable also to the case of
the woman whose husband is alive, but subject to such disabilities as
impotence and the like. That such is the meaning is clear from what
follows later (in 63). As a matter of fact, the sole purpose underlying
the practice lies in what is stated in the present verse; the
restriction too pertains to persons subject to the law, and not to the
observances themselves. Otherwise it would seem that the whole thing
pertained to widows only. (?)

‘*At* *night*—this is meant to indicate the *absence of all light*, in
the shape of lamps etc.; intercourse *during the day* having been
already forbidden by another text.

Others however hold that the prohibition of intercourse during the day
is with reference to the benefit of the man, while the specification of
‘night’ in the present text bears upon ritualistic purposes.

Hence what is meant is that ‘*only one*.’—and never a
second—‘*Kṣetraja*’ son is to be begotten; but never by intercourse
during the day.—(60)

An exception to this is set forth in the next verse:—

[(See texts under
59.)]

*Vaśiṣṭha* (17.61, *et seq*.).—‘He shall approach the widow in the
moment sacred to Prajāpati, behaving like a husband, without dallying
with her, and without abusing or ill-treating her. She shall obtain the
expenses for food, raiment, baths and unguents from the estate of her
deceased husband. They declare that a son begotten on a widow not duly
authorised belongs to the begetter; if she has been duly authorised, the
child belongs to both the males connected with the authorisation. No
such authorisation shall be made for the purpose of obtaining a living.
But some people declare that an authorisation may be made through desire
for wealth, after an expiatory penance has been performed.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.68-69).—(See under 59.)

*Gautama* (18.8).—‘She shall not bear more than two sons.’

*Nārada* (12.82-88).—‘He shall approach the woman, free from passion,
and without amorous desire. He must have anointed his limbs with
clarified butter, or with oil which has not lost its natural condition,
and must turn away his face from hers and avoid the contact of limb with
limb. For this custom is practised only when the family threatens to
become extinct, for the continuance of the lineage, and not from amorous
desire. He must not approach a woman who is with child, or blameworthy,
or not duly authorised by her relations. Should a woman procreate a son
with her brother-in-law without having been authorised thereto by her
relations, that son is declared illegitimate and incapable of
inheriting, by the expounders of the Veda. So when a younger brother has
intercourse, without authorisation, with the wife of his elder
brother,—or an elder brother with the wife of his younger brother,—they
are both held to have committed incest. If he has been authorised by the
elders, he shall approach the woman and advise her in the manner
previously stated, as if she were his daughter-in-law. He becomes
purified of the sin when the son is born and his Birth-ceremonies have
been performed. He shall approach her only once,—or till conception has
taken place. When she has become pregnant, she is again even as a
daughter-in-law to him. Should the man or woman behave otherwise,
impelled by amorous desire, they shall be severely punished by the King.
Otherwise righteousness would be violated.’

*Yama* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 446).—‘When during her period, the woman has
taken her bath, her brother-in-law, desiring an offspring for his
deceased brother, may approach her during the dark night, with speech
held in check, with a single cloth on, and his body anointed with
clarified butter, and mind stricken with grief, avoiding the contact of
his face and limbs with her face and limbs.’
