It is the eldest brother who advances the family, or ruins it; the eldest brother is worthy of the highest honour; the eldest brother is never ill-treated by good men.—(109)

This is another eulogy on the eldest brother.

The right sort of eldest brother ‘*advances the family*’; and when the
same is devoid of qualities, he ‘*ruins it*.’ When the eldest brother
has a good character, his younger brothers also behave in the same
manner. And when not possessed of good qualities, all these quarrel
among themselves.—(109)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 457), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kulam vardhayati*’, the prosperity of the family
being brought about by the adopting of proper business-methods and the
taking care of the younger brothers;—‘*vināśayati*’, all that this means
is that he is in a position to ruin the family;—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 656);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra
172a).

109	The eldest (son) makes the family prosperous or, on the contrary, brings it to ruin; the eldest (is considered) among men most worthy of honour, the eldest is not treated with disrespect by the virtuous.
