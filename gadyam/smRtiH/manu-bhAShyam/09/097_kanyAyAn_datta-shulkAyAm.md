यस्याः पित्रादिभिर् गृहीतं शुल्क, न च दत्ता, केवलवचनेन देयत्वेन व्यवस्थिता, अत्रान्तरे स चेन् **म्रियेत** तदा — अन्यद्द्रव्यवद् देवरेषु प्राप्ता सर्वेषु[^२५४] वा युधिष्ठिरादिवत्, तदभावे सपिण्डेषु — अतो विशेषार्थम् इदम् उच्यते- **देवराय प्रदातव्येति**, न सर्वेभ्यो भर्तृभ्रातृभ्यो नापि सपिण्डेभ्यः, किं तर्ह्य् एकस्मै देवरायैव । तत्रापि कन्याया अनुमतौ सत्यां । 


[^२५४]:
     M G: prajārtheṣu

- अथासत्यां कन्यायाः शुल्कस्य च का प्रतिपत्तिः । 

- यदि कन्यायै रोचते ब्रह्मचर्यं तदा शुल्कं कन्यापितृपक्षाणाम् एव । अथ पत्यन्तरम् अर्थयते तदा प्राग्गृहीतं शुल्कं त्यक्त्वान्यस्माद् आदाय दीयते ॥ ९.९७ ॥

When the nuptial fee has been received by her father and other
relations, but she has not been given away,—only the verbal betrothal
having been done,—if, in the interval, the giver of the foe happen to
die, then there arises the doubt, as to whether she, in the manner of
other goods, shall revert to the younger brother-in-law, or to all
brothers, as in the ease of Yudhiṣṭhira and others, or in the absence of
brothers, to ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ relations,—the text lays down the rule that
‘*she should he given to the younger brother-in-law*’;—not either to all
the brothers of her husband, or to all his ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ relations,—but to
his younger brother only. But hero also, only if the girl consents.

“In the event of the girl not consenting, what shall become of the
nuptial fee?”

If the girl desires to take to life-long celibacy, then the fee shall
remain with the members of her father’s family; but if she seeks for
another husband, then the fee shall be refunded out of the fee received
from this second man.—(97)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 153);—in *Nirṇayasindhu*
(p. 227);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 739);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 105), which explains the meaning to be that ‘if the girl agrees she
may be given to the younger brother, but if she prefers to be given to
some one else, she should be given to this latter’—in
*Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 454);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 530);—in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 227);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
219).

(See under
[47],
[69]
and
[71].)

*Vaśiṣṭha* (17-72).—‘If the betrothed of a maiden die after she has been
promised to him verbally and by a libation of water,—but before she was
married to him with the sacred texts,—she belongs to her father.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, 739).—‘If a man should die or
become lost, after betrothal, the girl shall wait for three menstrual
periods and then marry another person. If the betrothed should go away
after having paid the nuptial fee and the girl’s dowry, the girl shall
be kept unmarried for one year, after which she should be given away in
the proper form to another man.’
