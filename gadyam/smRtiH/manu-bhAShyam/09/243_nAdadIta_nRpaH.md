“It has been laid down that fines constitute one of the sources of
income for the King; why then should it now be declared that he shall
not appropriate such property?”

This has been explained under the text ‘*Rājanirdhūta-daṇḍaḥ etc.,
etc.*’—(243)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 637);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1053);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 121),
