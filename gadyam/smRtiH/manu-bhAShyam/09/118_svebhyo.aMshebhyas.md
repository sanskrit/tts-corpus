<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The term ‘*kanyā*’ is, as a rule, used in the sense of the *unmarried
girl*’, as we find in the case where a son is called ‘*kānīna*’ (which
means *born of a kanyā, i.e*., of an unmarried woman). In another
*Smṛti* text, ‘*anūḍhā*’ (‘unmarried’) is the actual word used. From
this it is dear that the share here laid down pertains to the unmarried
girl.

‘*Of the mine caste*.’—Each of the brothers should give to the sister of
the same caste as himself the fourth part of his own share. That is to
say, in a case where the father has left several unmarried girls, the
share allotted *to ouch of them should be the* fourth part of the
portion of the brother belonging to the same caste as himself.

The upshot therefore comes to be this:—Three *parts* of the property
shall be taken by the sons and the fourth part by the daughter.

Some people have held the following view:—Three parts of the property
shall be taken by the sons and the fourth part by the daughter.

Others have held the following view:—“Truly a great benefit is derived
by the daughter from her father:

If the father is alive they have their marriage performed at tremendous
expense, and if he is dead, she obtains a share in the property.”

But the same may be said of the son also. Further, why should there be
such objections against what is distinctly laid down by the words of the
text?

If the idea of the objector is that, according to custom, the only
benefit to which the girl is entitled is that her marriage should be
performed,—then our answer is that the direct assertion of the Smṛti is
infinitely more authoritative than custom. As a matter of fact however,
the custom referred to is by no means universal; so that when it is only
limited in scope, the right course is to adopt the course laid down in
the Smṛti text.

Some people have held the view that—“all that need be given to the girl
is what is necessary for her marriage, and not quite the *fourth part*
as mentioned in the text”

But to such people we address the following remarks:—There is no
restriction upon gifts in connection with marriage, as there is in
connection with the sacrificial fee, which is fixed at¹ twelve hundred.’
The gift in connection with marriage however is not precisely fixed. For
it is said.—‘The father shall marry the girl, clothed and adorned, and
he may also give her a dowry;’ and as ornaments are of various kinds,
made of gold, jewels, pearls, corals and such substances, it cannot be
definitely ascertained how much wealth is to be given on that account,
or what sort of ornament is to be given. So that even for the purpose of
precisely defining what shall be given, it is only right to say that the
brother shall give the fourth part of bis share. Nor does this militate
against either any scriptual injunctions or reason.

This same view is supported by other *Smṛti* texts also: ‘The brothers
who have already had their sacramental rites performed, should perform
the same for the unmarried girls; and sisters should receive from their
brother’s the fourth part of their shore’ (*Yājñavalkya* 2. 124); and
again—‘Until marriage has not been performed, she shall received a
share; after marriage she shall be maintained by her husband.’

What this last text means is as follows:—When the property left for the
brother and the sister is small, and the fourth part of the brother’s
share is not sufficient for the sister’s maintenance,—in such a case the
sister shall enjoy a share equal to her brother’s, until her marriage;
after which she shall receive the fourth part of the share, even though
if be small. And in answer to the question as to how that, would
maintain the girl, the answer is that ‘after marriage she shall be
maintained by her husband.’

The term ‘brother’ in the present text has been explained as standing
for the *uterine brother*. But what is the purpose of adding this
explanation? As a matter of fact, the term ‘brother’ without a prefixed
qualification is always directly applied to the uterine brother. And the
term ‘*severally*’ in the text is also indicative of the same idea.

But in that case the girl that has no uterine brother would have to go
without a share in the property; nor could there be any chance for any
dowry being provided for her. It might be argued that her step-brother
would provide for her. But in the absence of some other text laying down
(such a gift), he may not give it

As a matter of fact however, the term ‘brother’ is found to be applied
to the sons of the same father and several mothers; and it is only to
cousins, maternal and paternal, that the term is applied figuratively.
If this view is accepted, it saves us from the contingency of
attributing several denotations to the single word ‘brother.’

The rule laid down in other Smṛti-texts also supports the allocation of
shares set forth in the present text. We read there as follows—^(‘)What
remains of the ancestral property, after the father’s debts have been
paid off’, shall be divided; other necessary payments also being made
out of it, such for instance as the gift to the unmarried girls; Here we
do not find the words ‘brother’ and^(‘)sister,’ which might give rise to
the doubt (as to the *uterine* or other kinds of brother being meant).

As regards the term ‘*severally*’ (in the text),—it has been added with
a view to guard against the possible interpretation that the fourth part
of the share of a single brother should be divided among all the
sisters.

It might be argued that—“all that this means is that the brothers would
incur sin by not giving out of their shares; and there is nothing to
force them to give it.” Hence it is added—‘*Those not inclined to give
would be outcasts*.’ A man is spoken of as^(‘)taking’ a thing only when
he is its owner, and no one speaks of such a thing as^(‘)to be *given*
to him;’ hence it is that no one speaks of the brothers *giving* to a
brother (both being *owners*); and whenever the word^(‘)giving’ is used,
it is only when the recipient is not the *owner* of the property
concerned.—(118)

‘If there are several brothers find only one sister, the former must
deduct from their several shares as much money as will make up the
fourth part of one brother’s share’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 731), which adds the following
notes ‘*Svebhyoṃśebhyaḥ*’ means ‘from out of the share of one brother’;
the plural number is used in view of the plurality of daughters;—‘*svāt
svāt*’, the repetition is in reference to daughters of diverse
castes;—thus the meaning comes to be as follows:—When a Brāhmaṇa has
wives of all the four castes, and each of these has daughters, then the
daughter born of the Brāhmaṇa wife is to receive the fourth part of the
share accruing to the son of the Brahmaṇa wife; similarly the daughter
of the Kṣatriya wife is to receive the fourth part of the share of the
son of the Kṣatriya wife. This however, is not the sister’s ‘*rightful*
inheritance’.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.124), which adds the following
explanation:—The Brāhmaṇa-sons should give to the Brāhmaṇa-daughters the
fourth part of the share that accrues to them in accordance with their
castes,—whereby 4 parts go to the Brāhmaṇa, etc. (see verse 153 below);
it does not mean that each brother should give a fourth part out of his
own share; what is meant is that the daughter of a certain caste is to
receive the fourth part of what is prescribed as the share of the son of
that caste;—the last clause ‘*patitāḥ syuraditsavaḥ*’ indicates the
obligatory character of the rule. For this same reason it is not right
to hold that all that the daughter is to receive is money enough for her
marriage. It goes on to add that the explanation provided by Asahāya and
Medhātitha is the right one. Thus it is decided that after the father’s
death, the daughter is actually *entitled* to a share.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 494), which adds the following
explanation:—It does not mean that the brother should take out a fourth
part of his own share and give it to his sister; what is meant is that
the daughter of a certaind (certain?) caste is to receive the fourth
part of what is prescribed as the share of the son of that caste; which
thus is to be given to her, for the purpose of her marriage. Thus the
meaning comes to be that out of the ‘four shares’ and the ‘three shares’
to which the sons of the Brāhmaṇa wife and those of the Kṣatriya wife
respectively are entitled,—out of the combined total of these—a ‘fourth
part’ shall be given to the daughter; so that while it is the ‘fourth
part’ that is to be given, the real purpose of this gift is to enable
her marriage to be performed. Such is the view of Viṣṇu, the *Kalpataru*
and the *Mitākṣarā*; while Halāyadha holds the opinion that no stress is
meant to be laid on the ‘fourth part’, all that is meant is that the
daughter is to receive what would be needed for the performance of her
marriage. And this is the view that appears to be most proper; for
whatever the ‘fourth part’ may be, the performance of the marriage would
be necessary in any case.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 345), which supplies
the following notes:—The meaning is that the brother belonging to the
Brāhmaṇa and other castes should each give to the sisters of the
Brāhmaṇa and other castes, the fourth part of his own share; that is to
say, (*a*) in a case where a man has only one wife, and that of the
Brāhmaṇa caste, and from her he has one son and one daughter,—the son
shall divide his father’s property into two parts, and having divided
one of these two parts into four parts, he shall give one of these four
parts to his sister and take the rest for himself;—when there are two
sons and one daughter, the property shall be divided into three parts,
and one of these three parts being divided into four parts, one of these
four parts is to go to the daughter, and the rest the two sons shall
divide between themselves;—when there is one son and two daughters, the
father’s property shall be divided into three parts, and one of these
three parts being divided into four parts, two of these latter parts
shall be given to the two daughters, and the rest shall be taken by the
son.—(*b*) But in a case where the man has left one son of the Brāhmaṇa
wife and one daughter of the Kṣatriya wife,—the father’s property shall
be divided into *seven* parts (‘four shares’ accruing to the Brāhmaṇa
son and ‘three shares’ to the Kṣatriya son), if there be one, the ‘three
shares’ (accruing to the Kṣatriya son) shall be divided into four parts,
one of these four parts shall be given to the Kṣatriya daughter, the
rest of the property going to the Brāhmaṇa son; where there are two
Brāhmaṇa sons and one Kṣatriya daughter the father’s property is to be
divided into *eleven* parts (4 shares for each of the Brāhmaṇa sons and
three for the Kṣatriya if there be one), and the three parts (accruing
to the Kṣatriya son) being divided into four parts, one of these four
parts shall go to the *Kṣatriya* daughter, and the rest of the property
shall be divided between the two Brāhmaṇa sons. On the same principle is
partition to proceed when there are brothers of different castes or
sisters in varying numbers; such is the explanation provided by
Medhātithi, and approved by Vijñāneśwara also;—Bhāruci on the other hand
holds that the ‘fourth share’ only stands for ‘such amount as may be
necessary for her marriage,’ and that therefore unmarried girls have no
*right* to the inheritance as such. This same view has been held also by
the author of the *Candrikā*,—of these two views, people may accept the
one that appears to be the most reasonable.

It is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 36a);—in
*Vivādacintāmani* (Calcutta, p. 134), which says that the meaning is
that ‘each daughter should receive the fourth part of what forms the
share of a son of the same caste as himself,’ and adds that stress is
not meant to be laid upon the ‘fourth part,’ what is meant is that so
much should be given to her as would suffice for her marriage;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 179b), which says that this does *not* mean
that ‘in the case of either form of partition among the brothers, each
brother should give to the sister a fourth part of his share’; as, if
there were so, if there are several brothers to a single sister, she
would have a very large property,—or if there were a single brother to
many sisters, he would have nothing left for himself;—all therefore that
is meant is that the brother should give to the sisters just enough to
suffice for her marriage—so says the Vivādaratnākara, the
Vivādacintāmaṇi and the rest;—this is not right; as the text is clear on
the point that by not giving to the sister the fourth part of his share,
the brother incurs a sin which is quite different from that incurred in
not providing for her marriage; the right explanation is that which has
been provided by Medhātithi and the Mitākṣarā. (It then proceeds to
quote these).

It is quoted by *Jīmūtavāhana* (Dāyabhāga, p. 114), which says that the
root ‘*dā*’ used makes it clear that the sisters have no *claims* over
the property.

This verse is quoted in *Mitālṣarā* (2. 119), to the effect that of the
animals mentioned, if an odd one remains after partition, it is to be
given to the qldest brother;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 686), to the same
effect;—in *Aparārka* (p. 723), which explains ‘*viṣamam*’ as a number
different from (not a multiple of) the number of brothers;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 498), which says that the odd animals are not to
be partitioned by being sold and the value divided, they should be taken
by the eldest brother;—and in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 57).
