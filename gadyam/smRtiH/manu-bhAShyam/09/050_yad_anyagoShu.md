The foregoing verse has indicated and explained the state of things as
pertaining to immoveable property; and the present verse points it out
in reference to cows and other animate belongings of men.

When one man’s bull begets a number of calves on cows belonging to other
men, the owner of the bull does not obtain a single one of those calves;
all of these calves belong to the ‘*owners o* *f the cows*’—the persons
to whom the cows belong.

‘*Of the bull*’—*i,e*., related to the bull—‘*Emission*’ sowing of
seed;—‘*in* *vain*’;—futile, useless.—(50)
