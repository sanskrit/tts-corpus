But if a wife, who is an invalid, is well-disposed and endowed with modesty, she may be superseded after her consent has been obtained; and in no case is she to be disgraced.—(82)

‘*Will-disposed*’—towards her husband; devoted to his service.

The present verse enjoins—(a) that her consent is to be obtained, and
(b) that she shall not be disgraced. This applies also to the case of
the barren wife, and to that of one who bears only daughters; because,
all these have been mentioned in the same context; and in none of these
is there any reason why she should be disgraced.

‘*In no cane*’—never.

‘*Disgraced*’—in the form of harsh words addressed in admonition.—(82)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 100), which adds that the
qualification ‘*sick*’ includes also the ‘barren’ wife, and ‘one who
gives birth *to* female children only’;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
508), as laying down a special consideration in the case of the devoted
wife;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 872) which adds that ‘*hitā*’
is mentioned only by way of illustration.
