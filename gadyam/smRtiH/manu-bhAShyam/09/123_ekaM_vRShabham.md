‘In case the younger son is born of the elder wife, and the elder one of the younger wife,—how would the partition be made?’—If such a doubt arises,—the son born of the elder wife shall take one bull as his ‘preferential share;’ the other bulls, which are not so good, shall belong to those who are junior to him, on account of the position of their mothers.—(122-123)

**(verses 9.122-123)**

‘*Elder wjfe*’—married first:—‘*younger wife*’—one who was married
later.

As between the sons born of these wives, the question arises whether
‘seniority’ shall he determined by the order in which their mothers have
been married?—or, by the order in which they were themselves born?
Having raised this question, the author answers it in the next
verse;—this method being adopted with a view to making the rule more
easily comprehensible.—(122)

‘*Pūrvajaḥ*’—he who is horn of the ‘*pūrvā*,’ the *elder*, wife, though
himself *younger* (in age)—is entitled to one excellent hull.

The other bulls that there may be,—‘*which are not so good*’—shall he
allotted to the other several brothers, one to each.

Hence the ‘preferential share’ laid down for the son born of the eldest
wife consists of the *best bull*;—the superiority of his share
consisting only in the *quality* of the bull, not in the *number*.

‘*Those who are junior to him*’—*i.e*., to the son born of the eldest
wife.—Junior by what?—‘*On account of the position* *of* *their
mothers*’—*i.e*., according to the order of their marriage. Thus the
seniority among the sons is determined by the seniority of their
mothers, and not by their own age.—(123)

**(verses 9.122-123)  
**

These verses are quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 473), which adds the
following explanation: The question here raised pertains to the case
where there are several sons born of several mothers belonging to the
*same caste* as the father; the term ‘*pūrvajaḥ*’ (in verse 123) stands
for the *younger son born of the senior wife*, as is clear from the
latter half of the verse; which means that the next best bullocks—those
not the very best—shall belong to those brothers who are ‘junior’ *by
reason of the junior position of their mothers*; *i.e*., whose mothers
are junior to the mother of the aforesaid

brother;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 461).

**(verses 9.122-126)  
**

*Gautama* (28.14-17).—‘If a man has several wives, the additional share
of the eldest son is one bull;—but if the eldest son also happen to be
born of the first-married wife, his additional share shall consist of
fifteen cows and one hull. The oldest son born of a later-married wife
shall share the estate equally with his younger brothers born of the
senior wife. Or the special shares shall be adjusted in each class of
sons, according to their mothers.’

*Bṛhaspati* (25.15).—‘When there are many sons sprung from one father,
equal in caste and number, but born of different mothers, a legal
division may be effected by adjusting the shares according to the
mothers.’

*Devala* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 477).—‘Among sons belonging to castes
other than that of the father, seniority is determined by their moral
character; between twins, by actual birth, *i.e*., that one is senior
whose face the father sees first.’
