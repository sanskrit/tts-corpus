Some one may have the following notion:—“Other men’s wives may be made
one’s *own* by paying money to the husband, and the difficulty regarding
ownership being thus removed, the son horn of her would belong to the
begetter.”

This is declared to be not possible. Wives of other men cannot be made
one s own even by the paying of a thousand gold-coins.

Nor, when she is abandoned by her husband on account of poverty, can the
wife belong to the man who receives her.

The reason for this lies in the fact that verse 3.4, which contains the
injunction of marriage, uses the verb ‘*udvaheta*’ (‘shall take’), in
the *Ātmanepada* form, which clearly indicates that the woman who has
been ‘taken’ through the sacramental rites by one man cannot he the
‘wife’ of any other man; just as the ‘*āhavanīya*’ (sacrificial Fire)
cannot he regarded as being so for any other person save the one who has
kindled it with the prescribed rites.

‘*Sale*’ stands for *purchase* as well as *exchange*; and
‘*Repudiation*’ for *abandoning*. By neither of them is the wife
‘*released*’— lose the character of ‘wife.’—(46)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 149), which explains
‘*niṣkraya*’ as *selling* and ‘*visarga*’ as *renouncing*, *divorcing*.
