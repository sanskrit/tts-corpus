through him; he shall offer the Ball to and take the wealth of that
grandfather.”’

*Viṣṇu* (15.10.11-12).—‘The *Kānīna* is the fifth kind of son; that son
is called so who is born of an unmarried daughter in the house of her
father;—and he belongs to the man who afterwards marries his mother.’

the son to his maternal grandfather.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 565).—‘If a son is born to a girl
who has not yet been given in marriage, in her father’s house, from a
man of the same caste as herself, that son is called *Kānīna*; and he is
a son to that man to whom the girl is subsequently given in marriage.’

*Nārada* (Do.).—‘The *Kānīna*, the *Sahoḍha* and the *Gūḍhaja* sons
belong to him who marries the mother.’
