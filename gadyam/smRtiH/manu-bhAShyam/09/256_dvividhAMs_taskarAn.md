Throughout the realm, hidden spies should find out all that pertains to
the king’s business; and hence they are spoken of as his ‘eyes’, and the
king called ‘*spy-eyed*’.

Though the action of the ‘open’ thief does not stand on the same footing
as that of the ‘concealed’ one—such as those who prowl about at night in
forests etc.’—yet both have been mentioned together for the purpose of
indicating the equality of the punishment to be meted out to them.—(256)

**(verses 9.256-260)  
**

*Bṛhaspati* (22, 2-5).—‘Thieves are of two kinds:—open and secret. These
are subdivided thousand-fold, according to their skill, ability and
*modus operandi*. Fraudulent traders, quacks, gamblers, corrupt judges,
those who accept bribes, cheats, persons posing as interpreters of omens
or performers of propitiatory rites, mean artists, forgers, hired
servants refusing to do their work, roguish umpires, perjured witnesses,
and jugglers,—these are called *open thieves*. Housebreakers,
highwaymen, robbers of bipeds and quadrupeds, stealers of clothes and
such things, and stealers of grain,—these are *secret thieves*.’

*Nārada* (Theft, 1-5).—‘Two kinds of robbers who steal the goods of
others, have to be distinguished:—the one kind *open* and the other kind
*secret. Open* rogues are those who forge measures and weights or
receive bribes, robbers, gamblers, public prostitutes, those who roam
about in disguise, those who make a living by teaching auspicious
ceremonies,—these and such like persons are considered *open* rogues.
Rogues acting *in secret* are those who roam in the woods, or he
concealed, as well as those who make a profession of stealing. They
attack and rob people who do not beware of them. Those who infest a
country, a village, or a house, or disturb a sacrificial act, cut
purses, and other persons of this sort also are considered to be *secret
rogues*.’
