This is a declamatory supplement to what has gone before. “Why is there
no difference?”

‘*Because the father and mother etc*., *etc*’—(133)
</details>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Na loke... na dharmataḥ*.’—‘Neither with regard to worldly affairs nor
to sacred deities’ (Kullūka);—‘with respect to sacred duties, according
to law’ (Rāghavānanda and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 191), to the effect that
the son’s son and the daughter’s son being on the same footing, just as
in the absence of the son, the property goes to the son’s son, so also
in the absence of the daughter it should go to the daughter’s son;—again
on p. 394;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 631, 664 and 752).

133	Between a son's son and the son of an (appointed) daughter there is no difference, neither with respect to worldly matters nor to sacred duties; for their father and mother both sprang from the body of the same (man).
