‘As the arrow shot by an after-shooter hitting a wounded animal in a hole (already made) is wasted, so does the seed become wasted when sown in what belongs to another.’—(43)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The author quotes the said ‘*gāthā*’.

‘*Iṣu*’ is arrow,—‘*becomes wasted*’.

‘*In a hole*’—at a wound.

The man who *shoots* a deer *after* it has been wounded by another
archer.

In this case the kill belongs to the man who wounded it first.

Or, the meaning may be that ‘the arrow shot *in the air*—*i.e*. away
from the mark—‘*becomes wasted*’—abortive,—*as also* when one shoots an
animal already wounded.’

In the same manner, the seed sown by a man in another’s wife, becomes
wasted. That is, the child born belongs to the owner of the
‘field’.—(43)

043	As the arrow, shot by (a hunter) who afterwards hits a wounded (deer) in the wound (made by another), is shot in vain, even so the seed, sown on what belongs to another, is quickly lost (to the sower).
