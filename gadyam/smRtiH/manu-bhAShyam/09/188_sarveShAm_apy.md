‘*Sarveṣām*’—‘Of all the heirs mentioned in the preceding verse’
(Rāghavānada);—‘of all males and females related in any way to the
deceased’ (Nandana);—the term indicates that other persons, not named
here, such as fellow-students and so forth, are also entitled to the
inheritance (Kullūka).

“Nārāyaṇa points out that this rule refers solely to the property of a
Brāhmaṇa”.—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 675), which says that it
refers to any Brāhmaṇa neighbour of the deceased;—in *Mitākṣarā*
(2.136), to the effect that on the failure of blood-relations, a
fellow-student, and a learned Brāhmaṇa, the property shall go to any
ordinary Brāhmaṇa;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 665);—in
*Dāyakramasaṅgraha* (p. 12);—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 333).

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 597);—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 354), which makes the same remark as *Mitākṣarā*.
