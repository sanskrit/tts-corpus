<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

From the prohibition of branding the forehead (in certain cases,
contained in 240)—‘People shall not be branded on the forehead,’—it
follows that the branding here laid down is to be done on the
forehead.—(237)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 635) which adds that all
this branding is to be done on the forehead;—in *Mitākṣarā* (2. 270),
which adds that this is meant, for those cases where the culprit is
unwilling to perform the prescribed expiation;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 304), which also adds the same remark;—in the *Aparārka*
(p. 842);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 42b);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
329);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 152b), which says that all this
penalty is meant for those who refuse to undergo the prescribed
expiations.
