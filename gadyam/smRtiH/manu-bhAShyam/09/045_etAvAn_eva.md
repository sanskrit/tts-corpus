युक्तं च यस्य भार्या तस्यापत्यं यस्माद् भार्याया भर्तुश् चैकत्वम् एव, प्रजाप्य् आत्मभूतैव । कथं वान्यस्यात्मा सो ऽन्यस्य भवेत् । एवं तावद् दृष्टम् एतल्लोके । शस्त्रज्ञा अप्य् एवम् एव **विप्राः प्राहुर्** इति ॥ ९.४५ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It is only right that the child belongs to the man whose wife the mother
is; because the husband and wife are one; and the child also is the man
himself; how then can the *self* of one man belong to another?

Such is the usage of the world, and the learned Brāhmaṇas also have made
the same assertion.—(45)

*Āpastamba* (2.14.16).—‘There is no division between husband and
wife;—for from the time of marriage, they are united in religious
ceremonies;—likewise also as regards the rewards for acts by which
spiritual merit is acquired;—and with respect to the acquisition of
property.’

045	He only is a perfect man who consists (of three persons united), his wife, himself, and his offspring; thus (says the Veda), and (learned) Brahmanas propound this (maxim) likewise, 'The husband is declared to be one with the wife.'
