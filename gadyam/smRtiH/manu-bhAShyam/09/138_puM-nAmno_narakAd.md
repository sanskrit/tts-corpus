Because the Son delivers his father from the hell called ‘Put,’ therefore has he been called ‘Putra,’ ‘Deliverer from Put,’ by the Self-existent One Himself.—(138)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is a declamatory supplement to the Injunction of begetting
children.

‘*The hell called Put*’—is the name given to the four kinds of elemental
life on the Earth. And from this is the father delivered by his son, as
soon as he is born; which means that he is born next in a divine life.

It is for this reason that he is called ‘*Putra*,’ ‘Deliverer from
Put.’—(138)

*Viṣṇu* (15.44).—‘Because he saves his father from the hell called
*Put*, therefore a male child is called *Putra* by Svayambhu himself.’

*Hārīta* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 583).—‘There is a hell named *Put*; one
whose line is broken goes to hell; hence as saving his father from that
hell, the male child is called *Putra*.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do., p. 584).—‘Since the male child saves the father from
the hell called *Put*, by his mere looking at his face,—therefore a man
should make an effort to procure a son.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Do.).—‘The father throws off his debt on the son, and
thereby attains immortality; hence as soon as the son is born, the
father should see his face.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* and *Paiṭhīnasi* (Do.)—‘Wherever the son is born, the
father rejoices at it; because through him he becomes freed from his
debts to the Pitṛs.’

*Smṛti* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 585).—‘Fathers fearing to fall into hell,
desire sons, hoping that one of them may repair to Gayā and bring about
their salvation.’
