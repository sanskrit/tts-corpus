There are some traders who rob people by having recourse to false
weights and measures; then there are those that evade the export and
import duties; all such traders belong to the class of ‘*open cheats*’.

‘*Concealed cheats*’—are those burglars and robbers who rob people
during the night and in forests and other desolate places. There are
some again who rob people by attacking them with force.

These are not the only ‘thorns’; but also those that are going to be
mentioned below.—(257)
