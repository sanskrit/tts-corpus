<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Disrespect towards Brāhmaṇas is to be avoided only through consideration
of their caste; and their learning or other qualifications have not to
be taken into consideration, as they are done in the making of gifts and
on other occasions. This stands on the same footing as the avoiding of
touching fire with the foot.—(317)

317	A Brahmana, be he ignorant or learned, is a great divinity, just as the fire, whether carried forth (for the performance of a burnt-oblation) or not carried forth, is a great divinity.
