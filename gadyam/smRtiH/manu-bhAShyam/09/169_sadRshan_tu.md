Here also the epithet ‘*worthy*’ refers to *qualities*.

Some people, however, explain it to mean ‘belonging to the same caste’;
b ut if this were meant by the author, the proper. reading would have
been ‘*sajātīyam*’ (in place of ‘*sadṛśantu*’). And we have already
pointed out above that the ‘worthiness’ meant in the present context is
not with reference to *caste*.

‘*Capable of discerning right and wrong*.’—Some people have explained
this to mean that no one shall be so ‘appointed’ until he has attained
his majority; sis until then he is not in a position to discern right
and wrong; all that he knows is that he is the ‘son’ of the man who has
begotten him and who is maintaining him at the time. So that he would
not be able to realise his ‘appointment’ as the son of any other man.
For this reason, the ‘appointment’ should be made only when he is able
to understand his position.

In reality, however, there is no difference between the two cases.

‘*Guṇadoṣavicakṣaṇam*’.—‘Knowing that by performing or not performing
Śrāddhas &c. merit or sin will follow’ (Kullūka);—‘knowing himself to be
the son of such and such a person and hence likely to become an out-cast
if he did not serve him properly’ (Rāghavānanda);—‘not a minor’ (‘some’
in Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 738), which explains ‘*sadṛśam*’
as referring to *caste*;—and in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 572), which adds
the following notes:—Here also, according to Medhātithi, ‘*sadṛśam*’
means‘of similar qualifications’;—‘*Guṇadoṣavicakṣaṇam*’ means ‘knowing
that there is merit in performing the after-death rites for the parents,
and sin in not performing them.’—‘*putragunaiḥ*’, obedience and such
qualities.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścītta, p. 38),—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 546 and 557);—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p.
74), which quotes *Vīvādacandra* to the effect that ‘*sadṛśam*’ means
‘of the same caste’;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 38a).

*Baudhāyana* (2.3-21).—‘He is called the *Kṛtrima*, appointed, son whom

the appointer independently of others.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 41).—‘The appointed son is one who is made a son.’
