By the mere birth of the eldest son, a man becomes ‘with son,’ and (hence) free from the debt to Pitṛs; it is for this reason that he deserves the whole.—(106)

*Cf*. Śruti—‘*Nāputrasya lokosti*’ (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7.3.9).

This verse is quoted in *Virādaratnākara* (p. 457), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Putrībhavati*’, becomes one who has fulfilled the
dictates of the scriptures regarding the begetting of offspring;—the
addition of ‘*mātra*’ is meant to indicate that, the man becomes ‘with
son’ even before the child has had its sacramental rites
performed;—‘*anṛṇaḥ*’, becomes freed, by the birth of a single son, from
one of the three kinds of debts which have been described in the *Śruti*
as besetting a man from his very birth.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 35);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācarā, p. 501);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 163);—in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 439);—in *Saṃskāra-ratnamālā* (p. 686);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 43);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
656);—in *Nṛsiṃhapraṣāda* (Saṃskāra 25b);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (pp.
450 and 491), which explains ‘*putrībhavati*’ as ‘becomes saved from the
hell called *Put*’;—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 86):—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra 171b);—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, pp. 37 and 250) as
lending support to the view that one’s title to another’s property is
determined also by the benefits conferred by the former on the latter.
