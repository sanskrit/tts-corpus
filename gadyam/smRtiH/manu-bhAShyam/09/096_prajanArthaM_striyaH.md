Women were created for the purpose of child-bearing, and men for the furfose of procreation. hence it is that Religious Rites have been ordained in the Veda as common between the man and his wife.—(96)

‘*Child-bearing*’—Conception.

‘*Procreation*’—Impregnating.

‘*Hence*’—*i.e*., because of the act of child-begetting being dependent
upon both,—the man’s Religious Rites have been ordained in the Veda, as
being in common with his wife.

Consequently, since alone by himself he could not be entitled to the
performance of any rites, he shall not abandon his wife, even though she
be hostile.—(96).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 418), which adds that the
term ‘*prajana*’ here stands for the act of conceiving and ‘*santāna*’
for the act of *depositing the seed*, fecundating.

096	To be mothers were women created, and to be fathers men; religious rites, therefore, are ordained in the Veda to be performed (by the husband) together with the wife.
