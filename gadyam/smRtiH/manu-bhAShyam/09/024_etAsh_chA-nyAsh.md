<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Low*’-inferior-‘*birth*’— origin: these who have this are said to be
‘*of low birth*’.

‘*Others*’—Gaṅgā, Kālī, and others.

Though the preceding verse has named only two, yet here we have
‘*these*,’ ‘*etāḥ*,’ in the plural, which may be explained as including
a third, indicated by the particle ‘*ca*’. Or, we may read the Dual form
‘*ete*’ instead of ‘*etāḥ*’.—(24)
