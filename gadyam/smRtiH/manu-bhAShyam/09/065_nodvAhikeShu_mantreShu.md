Nowhere in the mantra-texts bearing upon marriage is ‘authorisation’ mentioned; nor again is the marriage of the widow mentioned in the injunction of marriage.—(65)

‘*Udvāha*,’ ‘marriage,’ is a *rite*; and the sacred texts used at that
rite—such as; (*a*) ‘*Aryamaṇannu devam kanyā agnimayakṣata*,’ (*b*)
‘*Mayā patyā jaradaṣṭih*,’ (*c*) ‘*Mayā patyā prajāvatī*,’ and so
forth,—in all these, it is clearly stated that ownership over the woman
belongs to the person that *marries* her; and nowhere among them is
there any such assertion as ‘beget a child from a man in regard to whom
you are *authorised* by me.’

What the text means by mentioning the ‘*mantra-texts*’ is that even
*Mantra-texts* and *Declamatory Texts* do not contain any indications of
the injunction of the practice. This is further explained.—‘*The
marriage of widows is not mentioned in the injunction of marriage*.’
‘Marriage’ here stands for *intercourse*. If the act of the
brother-in-law having intercourse with his widowed sister-in-law were a
regular ‘marriage,’ then, the practice of ‘*niyoga*,’ ‘authorisation’,
would be the same as ‘Marriage’; and as such, it would be fully
*enjoined* by some such injunction as ‘the brother-in-law shall marry
his sister-in-law.’ As a matter of fact, however, there is no such
injunction at all.

This is a declamatory supplement to what has gone before.—(65)
