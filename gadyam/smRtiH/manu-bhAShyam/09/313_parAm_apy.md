Even when fallen in the deepest distress, the king shall not provoke the Brāhmaṇas; for if provoked, they would ruin him, along with his army and conveyances.—(313)

यः क्षीणकोशो बलीयसा च राज्ञा दण्ड्यते, तथापि न ब्राह्मणधनम् अप्य् आपदि ग्रहीतव्यम् । न चावज्ञानादिना **प्रकोपनीयाः** ॥ ९.३१३ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Even when a, King with a depleted treasury has a heavy indemnity levied
by a powerful enemy,—even in such a distress, he shall not draw upon the
wealth of the *Brāhmaṇa*; nor are they to be provoked to anger by any
marks of disrespect etc.—(313)
</details>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājaniti, p. 151), which adds
the following explanations:—‘*Parām āpadam*’ the w orst calamity,
brought about by the depletion of his treasury and by being attacked by
a more powerful King;—even though fallen in such, the king should not
‘provoke the Brāhmaṇas to anger’, by forcibly seizing their property or
by treating them with disrespect.

It adds that from 313 to 321, it is mere *Arthavāda*, and all that it
means is that even when a Brāhmaṇa commits an offence, he should not be
punished.

**(verses 9.313-322)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (13.152.16, 21-23).—‘Brāhmaṇas depend upon the Kṣatriya,
not the Kṣatriya on the Brāhmaṇa. There is none who can deprive me—says
Arjuna—of any kingdom; I am therefore superior to the Brāhmaṇa.’

Do. (12.56.24).—(Same as Manu 321.)

Do. (12.78.21).—(Same as Manu 320.)

*Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa* (4.1.4.4-6.)

*Gautama* (11.14).—‘It is declared in the Veda—“Kṣatriyas, who are
assisted by Brāhmaṇas, prosper and do not fall into distress.”’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (19.4).—‘It is declared in the Veda—“A realm where a Brāhmaṇa
is appointed domestic priest prospers.”’

*Nārada* (18.12).—‘On account of their dignity and sanctity, it is not
permitted to either advise or rebuke a King or a Brāhmaṇa, unless they
swerve from the path of duty.’

Do. (18.34-39).—‘Let a king be constantly intent upon showing honour to
the Brāhmaṇas; a field furnished with Brāhmaṇas is the root of the
prosperity of the world. A Brāhmaṇa may command respect and a
distinguished seat at the King’s Court; the King shall show his face in
the morning before the Brāhmaṇas first of all, and shall salute them
all.—When nine or seven persons meet, they shall first make room for the
Brāhmaṇa to pass by. Brāhmaṇas shall also have free access to the houses
of other people, for the purpose of begging alms; also the right to
collect fuel, flowers, water and the like, without its being regarded as
*theft*,—and to converse with men’s wives, without restraint;—and also
the right to cross rivers without paying any fare, and to be conveyed to
the other bank before other people. When engaged in trading and using a
ferryboat, they shall pay no toll.—A Brāhmaṇa engaged in travelling, who
is tired and has nothing to eat, commits no wrong by taking two canes of
sugar or two esculent roots.’

*Arthaśāstra* (1.47).—‘The Kṣatriya Power is gloriously victorious when
it is augmented by the Brāhmaṇas, embellished by the counsel of
ministers, and supported by the deductions of the scriptures.’

*Viṣṇu-dharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 150).—‘The King shall
never take a Brāhmaṇa’s property; he shall always protect it.... Even
though the Brāhmaṇa be devoid of learning or of vicious conduct, he
shall never bear ill-will towards him.’
