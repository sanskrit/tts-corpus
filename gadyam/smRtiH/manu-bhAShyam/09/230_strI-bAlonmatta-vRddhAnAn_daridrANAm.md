‘*Punishment*’.—The persons meant, here are such poor people as are
incapable of doing labour. As these would stand on the same footing as
the ‘great sinners’, they shall be chastised with the creeper etc.

‘*Śiphā*’ is *creeper*, and ‘*vidala*’—*tree-bark*.—(230)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 658), which adds that the
term ‘*daridra*’ here stands for that impecunious person who is unable
to render any compensatory service;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p.
159);—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 880).

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 655).—‘Untouchables, rogues and slaves,
those who have committed sins and those born of inverse marriages should
suffer beating, and not monetary punishment.’
