Under 9.185, it is said—‘Sons, and not brothers or fathers, are the
inheritors of the father’s property’—where all sons are declared to be
entitled to inheritance. So long as the ‘legitimate’ son is alive, the
‘*Kṣetraja*’ and other sons are entitled to maintenance only: ‘The
legitimate son alone is the sole master of the entire paternal property;
for the others he shall, as an act of kindness, provide for
subsistence,’ says Manu (9.163). Thus then the fact of the adopted son
inheriting the lather’s property is already established; the present
text therefore is meant to indicate that he is so entitled, even when
the legitimate son is there. If it did not mean this, there would he no
point in the verse at all.

The question that arises is—what shall he the share of the adopted son?

Some people hold that, since nothing particular has been laid down, the
share shall he equal to that of the legitimate son.

This however is not right. If shares had been meant to be equal, then
this would have been clearly stated, as it has been in the case of the
son of the Appointed Daughter (under 9.134). Hence it follows that, as
in the ease of the *Kṣetraja* son, so here also, the share shall be the
sixth or eighth part (of that of the legitimate son).

In this connection there is something to be said. Just as the author has
declared the share of the *Kṣetraja* son to be ‘the sixth part’ (9.164),
that, of the ‘adopted’ son also would have been prescribed (if it were
so intended).

Thus then, the real purport of the reiteration contained in the present
verse has got to be found out.

Our revered teacher explains as follows:—The idea provided by the
present verse is that, inasmuch as no particular share has been
specified, the slare of the adopted son should be understood to be less
than that of the *Kṣetraja*; and he cannot, go without, a share; nor is
he entitled to a share equal to that of the *legitimate sun*, or to that
of the *Kṣetraja* son.—(141)

“Medhātīthi, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda refer this rule to the case where
a man has a legitimate son and an adopted son, and think that in such a
case the latter, being eminently virtuous, shall receive, like the
*Kṣetraja*, a fifth or sixth part of the Estate. Medhātithi remarks that
some think he is to have half, but that this opinion is improper, and
finally that *Upadhyāya*, *i.e*., his teacher, allots to the adopted son
less than to the *Kṣetraja*.—Kullūka and Rāghavānanda state that
Govindarāja took the verse to mean that the eminently virtuous adopted,
son shall inherit on failure of a legitimate son and of the son of the
wife, but that this explanation is inadmissible on account of verse
165.—Nārāyaṇa says ‘it has been declared that the adopted son receives a
share like the chief son, when he is eminently virtuous’.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 567), which adds the
following note:—‘*Guṇaīḥ*’, such as caste, learning and character;—the
fact of this adopted son being entitled to inherit being patent from the
fact of his being a ‘son’, the specific mention of ‘being endowed with
virtues’ is meant to indicate that in a case where a body-born son
happens to he born after the adoption, the adopted son is to have a
share in the inheritance only if he is ‘endowed with virtues’, while if
he is not so endowed, he is entitled to maintenance only.

It is quoted in *Dattakamīmāṃsā* (p. 28) as countenancing the adopted
son’s inheritance of the entire property of the adoptive father, when
the latter leaves no ‘body-born’ son;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 370),
to the effect that the adopted son is entitled to an equal share with
the ‘body-born’ son;—and in *Saṃskāra-ratnamālā* (p. 769) to the same
effect as *Dattakamīmāṃsā*.
