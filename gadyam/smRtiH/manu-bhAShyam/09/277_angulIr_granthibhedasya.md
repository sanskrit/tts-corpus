**(verses 9.276-277)**

‘*Cut-purse*’—one who cuts out a purse; *i.e*., the opening of knots or
bundles of cloth. Or the name ‘cut-purse’ may apply to those persons who
are bent upon slinking away, on some pretext, with the property that has
been stolen,—after loosening the knots with which he may have been
bound.

When such a man has been detected in doing this for the first time, his
fingers shall be cut off; on the second occasion a hand and a foot; and
on the third, he shall suffer death.—(276-277)

**(verse 9.276)**

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2. 275), as illustrating the
principle that the severity of the penalty is to be determined by the
seriousness of the offence;—in *Aparārka* (p. 845), which explains the
meaning to be that the nails are to he fixed on the points where the two
hands have been cut off;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 316), which adds that
when construed with ‘*śūle niveśayet*’, ‘*teṣām*’ is to be taken as
‘*tān*’;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 86);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra 151b).

**(verse 9.277)**

‘*Aṅgulīḥ*’—Rāghavānanda reads ‘*aṅgulī*’ (Dual) and explains that the
thumb and the index-finger are meant;—the same view is held by Kullūka
also;—according to Nandana, the ‘two fingers’ are the index and the
middle fingers,—Medhātithi adopts the reading in the plural.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 321), which reads
‘*aṅgulī*’ (Dual) and explains it as the thumb and the index
finger;—‘*graha*’, detection;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 302),
which explains the ‘two fingers’ as the thumb and the index finger;—in
*Aparārka* (p. 845);—in *Mitākṣarā* (2. 274) to the effect that a
pickpocket detected thrice should be put to death;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(Calcutta, p. 87), which adds the following explanations—‘If one is
detected in untying cattle for stealing it, then, if it is the first
offence of its kind, his fingers should be cut off, in the second
offence, his hands and feet, and in the third, death-penalty is to be
inflicted;—and in *Nṛṣiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 42b).
