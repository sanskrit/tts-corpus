The tending of cattle is not only a means of *livelihood* for the
Vaiśya; it also forms his *duty*. This is what is indicated by this
declamatory passage.

“How is it that the author should impose an invisible (transcedental)
character upon what is quite visible?”

It has been done with a view to bringing it home to the Vaiśya that he
must, as an obligation, do the tending of cattle, in the same manner as
the *Kṣatriya* does the protecting of the people.

How the protecting of the people is binding upon the *Kṣatriya* has
already been explained before. As for the *Brāhmaṇa*, he is entitled to
all sorts of ‘protection,’ by virtue of his being the person who
prescribes the necessary expiatory rites, performs prayers, offers
oblations and thereby obtains min from the sun, and so forth.

What is stated here is only by way of illustration; and all that is
meant is that the tending of cattle forms the duty of the Vaiśya.—(327)
