In regard to certain substances it has been declared that in exchanges
they shall be treated as equivalent:—*e.g*., Sesamum and paddy have been
declared to be equal; if in regard to such articles, some one treats
them as *unequal*—*i.e*., having advanced sesamum, he receives in
payment a larger quantity of paddy;—or even when there is no exchange,
in the act of buying and selling, if one buys sesamum at a price higher
than that given for paddy;—or in a case when one man has an upper
garment for sale, and another an under-clothing, and the latter stands
in need of the latter,—though the two are of equal value, yet knowing
the greater need of the man with the upper garment, the latter offers to
him the under-clothing, but not in equal exchange, but for a higher
price,—such a man is said to ‘*treat equals as unequals*’ in value.

The punishments prescribed are for both the buyer and the seller; since
both are parties to the act of ‘treating equals as unequals.’

The term ‘*vā*’, in this case is superfluous, serving only to fill up
the metre.

The two alternative fines—the ‘first’ and the ‘middlemost’—are laid
down, as to be determined by the value of the commodities
concerned.—(287)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 825), which adds the following
explanations:—That man suffers the ‘first amercement’ who deals with
honest, customers—who pay the right price—dishonestly, giving them
cheaper articles; and the ‘middle amercement’ is the penalty for the man
who, selling the right commodity, receives a higher or lower price.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 296), which adds the following
explanation:—The man, who, receiving the same price from a number of
purchasers, sells to them articles of varying, qualities, suffers the
‘first amercement’; and the man who sells commodities of the same
quality to a number of persons, but charges them varying prices, suffers
the ‘middle amercement It goes on to quote Halāyudha as explaining (with
Medhātithi) the verse to mean that the man who deals dishonestly;
‘*viṣamam*’—*i.e*. in exchanging things with a man, he, taking advantage
of the needs of the other party, gives less of his own commodity and
receives more of that of the other man,—when in reality both commodities
are recognised to be of equal value,—or when the vendor, taking
advantage of the needs of the customer, sells to him a cheaper article
at a higher price,—he should suffer either the ‘first’ or the ‘middle’
amercement, according to the value of the commodity concerned. It is
quoted in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 80), which explains ‘*samaiḥ*’
as ‘ordinary’, and adds the explanation—‘one who replaces a valuable
article by an ordinary one, should fined 250 *Paṇas* if the other party
is put to a loss of the seventh part of his outlay, and 500 *Paṇas* if
the loss is the fifth part or more’.
