<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The term ‘*gāthā*’ is the name of a particular metre; as has been
declared by Piṅgala—‘*Atrāsiddhaṅgātheti* it is also used in the sense
of verses handed down by a long-continued tradition. For instance, in
the Veda, we find that, having made the declaration—‘This is the *gāthā*
of the learned that is going to be recited’, it goes on to quote the
verses ‘*Yadasya pūrvamaparanta-dasya* &c.’

‘*Sung by Vāyu*’—recited, declared by him.

‘*Conversant with ancient lore*;’—those who know all about what happened
in the past cycles.

‘*In what belongs to another*’—In another man’s field.—(42)
