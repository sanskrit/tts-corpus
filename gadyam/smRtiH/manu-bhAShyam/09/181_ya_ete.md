<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Some people explain this to mean the denial of the injunction regarding
the other sons, even in the absence of the ‘legitimate’ son; the sense
being that—‘those that have been described as substitutes to be
appointed in the absence of the legitimate son, should not be appointed,
because; being born of the seed of another man, they are the sons of
that man, and of none other; they cannot he the ‘sons’ of the man that
appoints them.’

Thus, the foregoing texts having sanctioned the appointing of such sons,
and the present text forbidding it, there should be *option*; and this
option shall be restricted to the inheriting of property. So that the
‘maiden-born,’ the ‘one received along with the wife,’ the ‘son of the
remarried woman’ and the ‘secretly born’ son are not entitled to inherit
property; the ‘adopted’ and the rest are entitled to inherit only in the
absence of the ‘legitimate’ son, while the ‘maiden-born’ and the rest
are not to inherit the father’s property even in the absence of die
‘legitimate’ son; they are entitled to food and clothing only, whether
the ‘legitimate’ son is there or not; since it has been declared (in 202
below)—‘It is only fair that the wise man should give to all food and
clothing according to his means; if he does not give it at all, he would
become an outcast.’—(181)

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.34-35).—‘The son belongs to the begetter............
After one’s death, the son belongs to the begetter.’

*Āpastamba* (2-13.6-10).—‘A Brāhmaṇa text says—“The son belongs to the
begetter.”—They quote also the following—“Having considered myself
formerly a father, I shall not now allow my wives to be approached by
other men; since they have declared that a son belongs to the
begetter...... In the next world, the son belongs to the begetter.”’

181	Those sons, who have been mentioned in connection with (the legitimate son of the body), being begotten by strangers, belong (in reality) to him from whose seed they sprang, but not to the other (man who took them).
