The woman has been declared to be like the ‘soil,’ and the man has been declared to be like the seed; and the production of all corporeal beings proceeds from the union of the soil and the seed.—(33)

‘*The woman*’ is as if it were ‘*the soil*’. ‘*Soil*’ stands for that
part of the Earth where corns are grown; and the woman is like that:
Just as the seed sown and held in the soil sprouts up, so also the semen
deposited in the woman.

‘*The man is like the seed*’,—Here also the term ‘*bhūta*’ denotes
similitude. The man’s semen is the ‘*seed*’, and not the man himself;
but he is himself so called because the semen is contained in him.

‘*From the union*’— contact, the relationship of container and
contained—there is ‘*the production*’—birth—‘*of all corporeal
beings*’—beings endowed with bodies; *i.e*. of the four kinds of living
beings. In the case of sweat-born insects also, the *ākāśa* is the
‘soil’ and *sweat* the ‘seed’, and the ‘union’ of these is the relation
of container and contained.

For the said reason it is only right that there should be the said
doubt; as there can be no ‘production’ when either of the two is absent;
the function of both being necessary in the begetting of the child; and
since there is nothing to indicate to which one of the two the child
belongs, hence the doubt as to whether the child belongs to both or to
either one of the two.

In fact, the whole of this subject relating to the relationship of the
child and the person to whom the child belongs is one that is amenable
to reasoning; as we shall show under the verso where the details are set
forth.—(33)

033	By the sacred tradition the woman is declared to be the soil, the man is declared to be the seed; the production of all corporeal beings (takes place) through the union of the soil with the seed.
