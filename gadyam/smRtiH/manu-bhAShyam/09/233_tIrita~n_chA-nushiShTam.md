Whenever a transaction in the King’s Court has been ‘*finally
settled*’,—the root ‘*tīr*’ (in ‘*tirtam*’) denoting
*completion*,—*i.e*. definitely concluded,—not only verbally, but duly
recorded;—as also ‘when a punishment has been inflicted’;—all this the
king shall ‘*accept as lawfully done, and shall not annul it*’;—except
in the case of the doubling of a fine,—which is thus recommended—‘the
king shall revise the case with a view to inflicting a double
fine’.—(233)

“Medhātithi and Kullūka refer this prohibition to cases which have been
properly decided in the King’s Courts, while Nārāyaṇa thinks that it
applies to orders passed by former kings.—Nandana gives a different
explanation of the words ‘*tīritam*’ and ‘*anuśiṣṭam*’...... according
to which the former means ‘a cause or plaint declared to be just or
unjust by the assessors,’ and the latter ‘a cause or plaint confirmed by
witnesses’.”—(Buhler).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (II, p. 231), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Anuśiṣṭam*,’ confirmed by witnesses and other
evidence, and hence ‘*tīritam*,’ decided by the assessors;—such suit the
king shall not reopen.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.306), which explains the meaning to be
that the king shall not have a suit reopened simply with a view to exact
a heavier fine; he may however have a decided suit reopened when the
losing party applies for reconsideration and stipulates that he would be
prepared to pay a double fine in the event of the suit being again
decided against him.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Vyavahāra, p. 161), which adds that
the verse refers to cases where the finding of the Court has been
accepted by the parties concerned;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (64b), which has
the following notes—‘*Tīritam*,’ decided and finished,—‘*anuśiṣṭam*,’
deposed to by the witnesses ,—‘*yatra kvacana*,’ in the village-assembly
or other places;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 38b), which says
1,000 *Paṇas* are meant

**(verses 9.233-234)  
**

*Yājñavalkya* (2.305).—‘The man who, though defeated in the suit, does
not accept defeat, and comes forward again to contest the suit, should
be again non-suited and fined double the amount of the suit.’

Do. (2.304).—‘Those cases that have been wrongly decided, the King shall
try again and punish each of the judges and the party in whose favour
the case had been decided by them, with a fine double the amount of the
suit.’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 866).—‘When a legal transaction has been
completed and a punishment has been inflicted,—if a party feels that it
has been illegally done, he should have the case re-tried, undertaking
to pay double the fine previously inflicted upon him.’

*Bṛhaspati* (6.5).—‘When a party does not feel satisfied with the
decision arrived at by assemblies of kindreds or other agencies, the
King should revise that decision and institute a fresh trial, if it
should prove to have been unjust.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.553).—‘When a Minister or the judge decides a case
contrary to the law, the King shall revise it and fine the judge one
thousand.’
