<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

For the wife going off in anger, caused by the super-session,—the
present text lays down two optional alternatives in the shape of
*confinement* or *divorce*. It would not be right in such a case for
either the mother-in-law or the father-in-law and other relations to
console her and appease her anger by means of presents of food and
clothing, or by sweet words, eta

‘Confinement’ consists in placing her in the charge of guards.

‘*Divorce*’, ‘*Casting off*’, has already been explained as consisting
in dropping intercourse with her, and avoiding her bed.

‘*Family*’—Relations, on the woman’s father’s side, as also those of the
husband’s own side.—(83)
</details>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Kula*’—‘His own relations as well as the wife’s parental relations’
(Medhātithi);—‘either the family members or the public, according to
circumstances’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 69), which adds
that ‘casting off’ means ‘sending her to her father’;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 288), which explains ‘*tyājyā*’ as
‘left among her own paternal relations, till such time as she is free
from her defects’;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 59);—in *Aparārka* (p.
101), which explains ‘*kulasannidhau*’ as ‘*pitrādikulasannidhau*’, in
the presence of her father and other members of the family;—in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 230);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 874), which
explains ‘*kula*’ as ‘her father and other relations’;—and in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 189).
