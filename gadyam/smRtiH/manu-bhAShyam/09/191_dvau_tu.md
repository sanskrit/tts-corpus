Kullūka and Nandana take this verse as referring to the case in which a
woman married twice successively two husbands and bore a son to each of
them; in this case, on the death of the husbands, the property of each
should be given by the mother to his own son.—Rāghavānanda, while
accepting this explanation, proposes another:—‘If two sons begotten by
two different men contend for the separate property of their mother,
&c., &c.’.—Nārāyaṇa holds that the verse refers to a contention between
a ‘body-born’ son and a ‘*golaka*’ or ‘*Paunarbhava*’ son for the
estates of their respective fathers held by their mother.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 588), which notes that the
term ‘*strī*’, according to the *Pārijāta*, stands for the prostitute,
the re-married widow or the dissolute woman;—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 483 and 758).
