But there is to be no additional share ‘out of ten,’ if all the brothers are efficient in their occupations; some little thing however shall be given to the eldest, as a mark of respect.—(115)

‘*Out of ten*’— animals.

‘The additional share,’ mentioned in the preceding verses,—there is to
be none,—when the brothers are all ‘*efficient*’—particularly
excellent—‘*in their occupations*’—of learning, study and so forth.

Some people take the term ‘*daśasu*,’ ‘out of ten,’ as purely
illustrative;—the sense being that there is to be none of the additional
shares that are mentioned in the text which speaks of ‘the best of ten;’
and the reason given for this explanation is that the text lays down
‘efficiency in occupations’ as the ground.

Even in such cases however, the other brothers should give to the eldest
brother ‘*some little thing*’—some present—as a mark of respect.—(115)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 476), which adds the
following explanation:—The additional share prescribed in the last
quarter of the last verse, ‘the best among them’, is not to be taken if
all the brothers are equal in learning and other qualities. This is only
by way of illustration; it means that none of the additional shares
mentioned in verses 112-114 is to be taken; as is clear from the clause
‘*yat kiñcideva deyam syāt*’; which means that some little thing is to
be given to the eldest brother, as a mark of respect due to his superior
age. When there is no difference among them on account of qualities,
then ‘Seniority’ among the brothers is to be determined by the portion
of their mothers, the son born of the senior-most wife having been
declared to be the ‘senior.’ That this is the finally adopted view (and
not a mere tentative one) is proved by the fact that both *Lakṣmīdhara*
and the *Pārijāta* have accepted the view that ‘the son of the senior
wife, even though younger in age, is to be regarded as senior.’

This is quoted by a *Jīmūtavāhana*, (Dāyabhāga, p. 74).

115	But among (brothers) equally skilled in their occupations, there is no additional share, (consisting of the best animal) among ten; some trifle only shall be given to the eldest as a token of respect.
