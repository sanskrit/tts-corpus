Even though in the cremation-ground, the brilliant fire is not defiled, and it flourishes again when libations are poured unto it at sacrifices.—(318)


Similarly even though they betake themselves to all sorts of undesirable acts, yet Brāhmaṇas should be honoured in every way; for they are the greatest divinity.—(319)

**(verses 9.318-319)**

What is said here has already gone before. The sense is that even though
ill-behaved, the Brāhmaṇa shall not be ill-treated.

‘*Undesirable*’—forbidden.

When they betake themselves to forbidden acts, they shall be dealt and
punished according to law, gently, and not attacked with force, in the
manner of other castes.—(318-319)

319	Thus, though Brahmanas employ themselves in all (sorts of) mean occupations, they must be honoured in every way; for (each of) them is a very great deity.
