If the ‘Soil-born’ and the ‘body-born’ sons are both entitled to inherit the same property, each shall receive that property which belongs to his own father, and not the other.—(162)

An impotent man having obtained a son from his ‘authorised’ wife through
another man, according to the method described under 167, may happen to
have his impotence cured by medicines and then himself beget his own
‘legitimate,’ ‘body-born’ son; and in this ease, the former son would
receive the property of his *progenitor*, who may be called his ‘father’
on the ground of his being the cause of his birth; and on the same
ground the child would be called his ‘son’ only figuratively; since in
reality he is the ‘*Kṣetraja*’ son of the other man, just as he is
referred to in this verse.

If, however, the progenitor happens to have a ‘legitimate’ son of his
own,—and if the father, moved by his great love, does not happen to have
made over all his property to that son,—and further, if there are no
other Sapiṇḍa relations—under such circumstances, the ‘*Kṣetraja*;’ son
may inherit the property of that progenitor. The sons of ‘unauthorised’
women also inherit the property of their progenitor, if there are no
‘Sapiṇḍa’ relations.

Others explain the verse to mean as follows:—While the rightful ‘heir’
is already there, if a ‘*Kṣetraja*’ son happen also to be bora, this
latter shall inherit the property of his progenitor, and not that of the
‘owner of the soil’ (his mother’s husband),—if there is a ‘legitimate’
son of the latter. In the presence of the legitimate son, what the share
of the ‘*Kṣetraja*’ son shall be is laid down in verses 165 and 164.

The next two verses show how the two sons become entitled to the same
property.—(162)

Medhātithi has been mis-represented here by Kullūka and also by Buhler.
(See text). Nārāyaṇa and Nandana hold that the rule refers to the case
of two undivided brothers, where one having died, the other, who has
sons of his own, begets on the other a *Kṣetraja* son; in which case on
the death of the second brother, the *Kṣetraja* is entitled to receive
only the share of his mother’s husband, not any in the estate of his
natural father.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 543), which has the
following notes:—The ‘*Kṣetraja*’ meant here is one begotten by one not
‘commissioned’ (by the elders);—‘*paitṛkam riktham*’ means ‘that
property which the father gave to the mother for the purpose of
maintaining the son.’ Others however construe the verse as it stands, in
the direct, sense—‘Each takes the property of his own father.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 739), as laying down that the
*Dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa-Kṣetraja* is entitled to inherit the property of his
progenitor-father.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (p. 169), which explains the meaning to
be that each is to take the property of the man from whose seed he was
born;—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 229), which says that the son
shall inherit the property of that person from whose ‘seed’ he may he
horn.
