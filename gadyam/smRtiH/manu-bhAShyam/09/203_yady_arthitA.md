‘*Longing*’—desire to meet, with a view to sexual intercourse. When
there is such longing, the man shall marry. And if there is issue from
the marriage, the ‘*child*’—whether a son or a daughter —‘*is entitled
to inheritance*’—to. a share in the property.

The share to which a daughter is entitled has already been explained.

“In the case of the eunuch of the ‘airy’ (infructuous) ‘semen,’ the
desire for sexual intercourse is there; but, how could he have any
‘issue’?”

It has already been declared above (167) that—‘if a son is born to the
wife of a dead man, a eunuch, an invalid, etc.’ (which shows that such
men can have a ‘soil-born’ son, and this is possible only if they have
wives).

Or, the verse may be taken as indicating that in the case of such men,
marriage could only he prompted by lust. If marriage wore prompted
entirely by religious motives, how could there be any marriage for the
men mentioned, being as they are not entitled to the performance of any
religious rites? Then again, the person born blind, the lame, and the
eunuch of the ‘airy semen,’ have been declared to be fit for the
Initiatory Ceremony; the lunatics and others of that kind however are
not fit for that ceremony; how then can there be any marriage in the
ease of those latter?

‘*And the rest*’—stands for only those already mentioned above (*i.e*.,
the *invalid*, etc); but if the phrase ‘*and the rest*’ were taken as
including *all*, then the ‘*outcast*’ also would become included, which,
bring contrary to Law, would be undesirable.

Or, the present rule may be taken as referring to the case where the man
becomes *insane* or otherwise disabled, after he has been ‘initiated’
and ‘married.’

“But the clause ‘*if they happen to have, longing for a wife*’—could not
apply to the ease of those who are already married.”

Not so; ‘longing for a wife’ (which has been explained as meaning
*desire for sexual intercourse*) is quite possible in the case of
married men.

The older writers have found in the present rule something that is
usefully applicable to the case of also such marriages as are contracted
for purely religious purpose?. So that for the eunuch also,—who is
entitled to the performance of such rites as are prescribed by
*Smṛtis*—it is only right that there be marriage, even in the absence of
sexual desire. As for the rites prescribed in *Śrutis*, it is only one
who has already got a son that is entitled to the ‘laying of fire’
(which is a necessary accompaniment for those rites); so that the eunuch
can never be entitled to them. And it has been already explained what
really prompts the marriage in such cases.—(203)

‘*Kathañcana*’.—This indicates that the eunuch and the rest are not
worthy to marry (Kullūka).

‘*Apatyam*’.—The *Kṣetraja* son (Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 488), which explains
‘*tantu*’ as *child*;—in *Aparārka* (p. 750), to the effect that
marriage is legal for the persons enumerated in 201; it remarks that in
view of the epithet ‘*jāti*’, ‘born’, in the term ‘*jātyandha*’, the
present verse cannot be taken as referring to cases where the
disabilities appear after marriage; it comes to the conclusion that the
disability to inheritance cannot thus be due to their not marrying and
hence not being able to perform religious rites; it must be due to the
mere authoritative assertion of the law.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 195) as indicating that
the marriage of the said persons is sanctioned.

*Gautama* (28.44).—‘The male offspring of the idiot receives his
father’s share.’

*Viṣṇu* (15.34-38).—‘Of the idiot and the rest the legitimate sons
receive a share;—but not the children of an outcast,—provided they are
born after the commission of the act that rendered the parents
outcasts.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.141).—‘Of the eunuch and the rest, the *Body-born* and
the *Kṣetraja* sons, if they are free from defects, are entitled to
shares; and their daughters should be maintained till they are made over
to their husbands.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparāka, p. 751).—‘One born of the outcast is an outcast,
except the female child.’

*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 419).—‘The sons of these are entitled to
shares.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do., p, 491).—‘The son of a wife married irregularly is
entitled to inheritance when he belongs to the same caste as his father;
so also is the son born of a regularly married wife, even though she may
have been of a different caste; but the son of a woman married in the
reverse order is not entitled to a share; to him his kinsmen should give
food and clothing.’
