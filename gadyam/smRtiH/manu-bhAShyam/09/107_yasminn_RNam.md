That son alone to whom the man transfers his debt, and through whom he attains immortality, is the ‘duty-born son;’ others are known as ‘lust-born.’—(107).

‘*Others, etc*.’—This is purely declamatory. If it were taken in its
literal sense, the younger brothers would never be entitled to any
property at all; and this would be contrary to what follows.—(107)

“This verse alludes to the Vedic text quoted, Vaśiṣṭha 17.1; Viṣṇu
15.43”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 457), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Sannayati*’, concentrates,—‘*ānantyam*’, endless
bliss,—‘*aśnute*’, obtains, *i.e*., becoming freed from
debt,—‘*Kāmajān*’, this is a mere exaggerated statement, because it
cannot be taken to mean that the younger sons have no share in the
paternal estate, since it has been distinctly declared that they do have
such share.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 163);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 656);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
43);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 172a);—by Jīmūtavāhana (Dāyabhāga, p.
37);—and in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 40b).

107	That son alone on whom he throws his debt and through whom he obtains immortality, is begotten for (the fulfilment of) the law; all the rest they consider the offspring of desire.
