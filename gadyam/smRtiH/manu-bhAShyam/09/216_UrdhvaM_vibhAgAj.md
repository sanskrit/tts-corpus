After the partition has been made,—in which the father has taken two
shares—if a son happens to be born, he shall receive these two shares,
during the father’s life-time, if the father wishes it so, or after the
death of the father, and his brothers shall not complain—‘why should he
have two shares?’ If, however, such is not father’s wish, then he shall
be assigned by the others a share equal to their own.

If some of the sons become re-united with the father, after the
partition has been made, then the father’s share shall go to them; and
the additional property arising therefrom shall be assigned by them as
the share of the other brothers. This property thus accrues to the son
united with the father; also after the father’s death, he receives his
share out of that same property (?),—in accordance with what has been
said above under 210.

As regards the sisters, they are not entitled to any share until they
have borne a child,—as declared by Vaśiṣṭha.—(216)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 538), which adds the
following explanation.—If a son is born to the father after partition of
the property between himself and his sons, then on the death of the
father that son shall inherit the entire share of the father; but during
his father’s lifetime he shall be entitled to only a part of the
father’s property;—it adds that the particle ‘*eva*’ has been added with
a view to emphasise that the new-born son would not be entitled to any
part of the share of the divided brothers.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 340), which explains
‘*pītryam*’ as ‘belonging to the parents—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 655),
which also adds the same explanation of ‘*pitryam*’;—in *Aparārka* (p.
729), which adds the explanation that ‘if a son is born after partition
has been made he shall take only his father’s, not the brothers’
property, and if there be no brothers, he shall share the father’s
property with those who may have lived jointly with his father’;—in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 46);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 159),
which remarks that the first half of the verse having definitely made
the new-born son the sole heir to the father’s property, his joint
brothers, mentioned in the second half, could be entitled to it only on
the death of that new-born son;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 35a):—in
*Smṛtisāroddharā* (p. 332);—and by Jīmātavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 203),
which explains the meaning to be as follows—‘If the father, after having
divided his property among his sons and taken his own share, obtains
another son, then the share taken by the father devolves upon this son,
and if the father had been living with some other sons, then the
new-born son shall receive his share out of the share of all those with
whom the father may have been living.’

*Gautama* (28.29).—‘A son horn after partition takes exclusively the
property of his father.’

*Viṣṇu* (17.3).—‘Sons who have separated from their father should give a
share to the brother who is born after the partition.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.122).—‘If a son is born of a wife of equal caste, after
the property has been partitioned (among the sons), ho is entitled to
the share of his father; or he may obtain his share from any such
property as may he discovered after the said partition, after it has
been cleared of all accounts of income and expenditure.’

*Bṛhsapati* (25.17, 20).—‘When step-brothers horn of different mothers,
or uterine brothers, have come to a division with their father, brothers
born after that shall take their father’s share. In such cases the son
horn before partition has no right to the father’s share; nor can a
brother’s property be claimed by one born after partition; whatever
shall have been acquired by the father, after he has come to a partition
with his sons, all that belongs to the son born after partition; those
born before it have no right to it. In regard to the property, as also
debts, gifts, pledges and purchases, the father and the divided sons
have no concern with one another; except in regard to impurity (due to
births and deaths) and the funeral oblations.’
