If one of them acquires something by his own effort, without interfering with the patrimony,—that property, being acquired by his own labour, he need not give to others, unless he himself wishes it.—(208)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It has been already declared that a man need not give what he acquires
by his learning; this verse lays down that he need not give what he
himself acquires by agriculture and other means.

“This verse alone would have been enough:^(‘)the man need not give,
unless he wishes it, what he acquires by his own labour’; what was the
need for the other verse making special mention of the ‘gains of
learning’?

The answer to this is that there is no individual^(‘)effort’ or ‘labour’
involved is the case of^(‘)friendly presents,’ ‘marriage presents,’ and
the like; hence it was necessary to have a distinct verse referring to
these.—(208)

‘*Īhitalabdham*’.—‘Obtained by such labour as agriculture and the like’
(Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nandana);—or ‘by any occupation entailing
trouble’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Anupaghnan*’.—‘Without using’ (Nandana);—‘without living upon
(Rāghavānanda);—‘without detriment to’ (Kullūka).

Nandana says that the rule given in this verse may be reconciled with
that given in 205 by assuming that the latter presupposes that all
brothers exert themselves according to their ability.—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.118), which explains ‘*Śrameṇa*’
as ‘by service, by fighting and so forth’;—and it reads the second line
totally differently, the meaning of which is ‘that shall not be given to
the co-sharers, norwhat is gained by learning’.—The *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds
that ‘*anupaghnan*’ is to be construed as ‘*anupaghnatā*.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 723), which explains ‘*śrama*’ as
‘soldiering, agriculture and so forth;’—and ‘*īhā*’ as ‘work without
much labour’;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 501);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 377), which explains ‘*śrama*’ as ‘agriculture and so
forth’ and notes that ‘*pitṛdravyam*’ here means ‘undivided
property’;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 685), which explains ‘*śrameṇa*’ as
‘by service, soldiering and so forth’;—by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p.
178);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 220b), which explains
‘*śrameṇa*’ as ‘by service and other means.’
