If seed, carried away by rain or wind, germinates in a soil,—that seed belongs to the owner of the soil, and the owner of the seed does not receive the produce.—(54)

It has been declared ([under
43])
that when a man sows his seed in another man’s soil, his seed is lost.
And on the basis people may have the following idea—“In the case cited,
it is only right that the produce shall be confiscated, since a wrong
act has been committed by the man, in that he has tried to obtain
surreptitious possession of the land,—otherwise, why should he go about
sowing his seed in another’s field? But in a case where the owner of the
seed has sown it in his own field, but it has been carried into another
field by water or wind, there is no wrong done by the man; in fact he
loses his own seed by this transference.”

It is with a view to combat such a notion that we have the present verse
declaring that when ‘*seed, carried away by rain or wind*’—‘*ogha*’
stands for *rain*,—‘*germinates in another man’s field*’,—then, the
produce belongs to the owner of the soil.

Thus is the special law established that ‘*the owner of the seed does
receive the produce*’; *i.e*., ownership of the soil is the more
important factor.—(54)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 150);—in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 579), which explains ‘*ogha*’ as ‘current of water’ and ‘*āhṛtam*’
as ‘earned,’ and adds that this also only serves to indicate the greater
importance of the ‘field’;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 521).
