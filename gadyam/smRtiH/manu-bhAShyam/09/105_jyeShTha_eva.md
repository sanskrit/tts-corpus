What is said here refers to eases where ‘the eldest son is specially
virtuous’ (Kūlluka and Rāghavānanda),—or ‘possesses eminent qualities,
and the others are less distinguished’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (p. 117), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following notes:—‘*Pitryam*’, inherited from the father,—‘*Śeṣāḥ*’,
brothers other than the eldest,—*Upajī* *veyuḥ*, should follow him, like
their father. *Mitākṣarā* adds that such unequal division, even though
sanctioned by the scriptures, should never be adopted, being opposed to
popular sentiment, and also to Vedic texts.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 35), in support of the
view that the eldest son should succeed to the kingdom;—in *Aparārka*
(p. 722), which adds that this rule is meant for eases where the younger
brothers are still in *status pupillari*, or are not entitled to any
share by reason of being idiots and so forth, or are inexperienced;—and
in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 457), which adds the following notes:—What is
meant is that in partition, the eldest brother, if he happens to be
possessed of all the qualities of the superior brother, should be
treated as the sole master, like the Father himself;—‘*tamupajīveyuḥ*’
means that ‘they should live on the subsistence provided by him.’

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (II, p. 170);—anti in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(Calcutta, p. 125), as laying down an alternative course;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 171b);—and by *Jīmūtavāhana* (Dayabhāga, pp.
35 and 103).

**(verses 9.105-110)

*Viṣṇu* (15.45).—(Same as Vaśiṣṭha.)

*Nārada* (13.5).—‘Or the senior brother shall maintain all like a
father, if they wish it; or even the youngest brother, if able; the

handed over the property to the sons, or when he has gone abroad, or
