नात्र प्रकरणे मासनियमो ऽभिप्रेतः । केवलं चतुर्षु मासेषु संततवर्षी पर्जन्यो भवति । अतः संततं सर्वकालं **स्वं राष्ट्रं**[^७६४]** कामैः** पूरयेद् इत्य् उक्तं भवति । तथा कर्तव्यं यथा स्वराष्ट्रिया अनुरक्ता भवन्ति ॥ ९.३०४ ॥

The actual limitation regarding the *four months* is not meant to be
emphasised in the present connection. What is meant is that during the
four months, the Cloud mins *constantly*, and hence the King also shall
confer benefits upon his people *constantly*. That is to say, he shall
so act that his people may become attached to him.—(304)
