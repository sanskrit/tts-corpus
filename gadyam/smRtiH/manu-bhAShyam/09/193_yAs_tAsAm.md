The grand-daughters should be *unmarried* (Kullūka);—‘when the married
daughters are dead, their daughters shall be presented at will by their
maternal uncles with the share which their mothers would have received
as a token of respect’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘*Prītipūrvakam*’ means ‘at the
pleasure of the sons’ (Rāghavānanda);—the gift to the grand-daughters is
absolutely compulsory (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 666) which explains
‘*tāsām*’ as ‘of the daughters of the deceased lady’;—in *Aparārka* (p.
722);—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 516), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Tāsām*’, of the daughters mentioned in the preceding
verse,—‘*yathāṃśataḥ*’, according as the property is large or small;—in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 71) as laying down that some part of the woman’s
property should be given to her grand-daughters;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(Calcutta, p. 142);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 216b), which
explains ‘*yathārhataḥ*’ as ‘in consideration of their poverty and other
circumstances’.
