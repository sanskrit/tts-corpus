It has been declared ‘that consummation of it is to be understood as
occurring at the seventh step’
[(8.227)].
People may be inclined to the notion that if the bridegroom dies before
this point has been reached, the girl may be given away to another man;
it is this notion that the present text, precludes.

This prohibition has been repeated here, in view of the special
circumstances herein mentioned; as a matter of fact, the girl married
after betrothal has been already declared to be a ‘remarried widow.’

When the girl has been betrothed, given away, to one man,—if he happens
to die—she shall not be given to another. By doing this the father
incurs the guilt of ‘*fraud towards men*’; —*i.e*., he incurs the same
guilt that would be incurred by the kidnapping of a human being.—(71)

[See above,
8.98.]

“Medhātithi and Nandana say that the verse is meant to forbid marriage
of a girl whose betrothed has died. But Kullūka thinks that it refers to
all cases where a betrothal has taken place, and that it removes a doubt
which might arise through a too strict interpretation of 8.227.”—Buhler.

This verse in quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 326);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 220).

*Viṣṇu* (5.160-161).—‘He who, having promised his daughter to one
suitor, marries her to another, shall be punished as a thief, unless the
first suitor have a blemish.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.65).—‘A girl is betrothed but once; if the father takes
her away after that, he should suffer the punishment of a thief; but he
may take her away from the man to whom she has been betrothed, if a
superior suitor happens to turn up.’

*Nārada* (12-30).—‘Should a more respectable suitor, who appears
eligible in point of religious merit, fortune and amiability, present
himself,—after the nuptial fee has already been presented by a former
suitor,—the verbal engagement previously made shall he annulled.’
