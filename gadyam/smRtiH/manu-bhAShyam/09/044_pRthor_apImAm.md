People learned in ancient lore have regarded this Pṛthvī (earth) to be the wife of Pṛthu; they declare the field to belong to him who has cleared off the stalks, and the deer to him who struck the dart.—(44)

The relation of husband and wife established by ancient tradition is
such that two totally distinct entities are spoken of as one. For
instance, though the Earth (*Pṛthivī*) was associated with King *Pṛthu*
thousands of years ago, yet she is even now named after him ‘*Pṛthivī*’.

In view of this, even though a son may be born of another man, he must
belong to him whose wife the mother is.

‘*They declare the field to belong to him who cleared off the
stalks*;’—there being no other relationship spoken of, the Genetive
ending (in ‘*sthāṇūcchedasya*’) must signify the relation of possessor
and possessed.

‘*Stalks*’— stands here for groves, thickets, creepers and other growths
on the land;—he who clears off these is ‘*he who clears off the
stalks*.’ The land belongs to him by whom the over-growths have been
cleared and the land levelled and made into arable land. The fruits of
filling and sowing this land also belong to that same man.

‘*The deer to belong to him who struck the dart*.’— ‘They declare’ has
to be construed with this also. Where several persons are hunting and
following a deer, they declare the animal to belong to him the dart of
whose arrow is found in its body. So that it belongs to the man who
wounded it first, and tills is what has been said above regarding ‘the
arrow of the shooter being wasted.’—(44)

Hopkins says—“The kings subsequent to Pṛthu, according to Medhātithi,
have no legitimate claim to possession.”—But there is nothing in
Medhātithi to this effect.

044	(Sages) who know the past call this earth (prithivi) even the wife of Prithu; they declare a field to belong to him who cleared away the timber, and a deer to him who (first) wounded it.
