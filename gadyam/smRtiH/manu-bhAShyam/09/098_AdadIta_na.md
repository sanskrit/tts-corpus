Even a Śūdra should not take a nuptial fee, when he is giving away his daughter; by accepting a fee, what he does is disguised bartering.—(98)

What is to be done when the fee is received voluntarily, has been laid
down in the preceding verse. Hence some people might come to entertain
the following notion—“There is nothing wrong in receiving the nuptial
fee, since the scriptures have laid down special rules regarding the
subject.” And with a view to preclude such a notion, the text
says—‘*even a Śūdra should not take a nuptial fee*.’—What the foregoing
text has done is to lay down certain rules relating to cases where a man
receives the fee, of his own will; and it does not lay down the
propriety of receiving the fee. Just as the laying down of expiatory
rites in connection with wine-drinking does not mean that the drinking
is permitted.

The ‘nuptial fee’ here spoken of is the same as what has been deprecated
in another text; and we have already explained why the same fact has
been reiterated in the present verse.’—(98)

**(verses 9.98-100)  
**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.36).—‘The buying of a wife is mentioned in the following
passage of the Veda:—“Therefore one hundred cows besides a chariot
should be given to the bride’s father.”’

*Āpastamba* (2.13.12)—‘It is declared in the Veda that at the time of
marriage, a gift, with a view to meet the father’s wishes, should be
made by the bridegroom to the father—“Therefore he should give a hundred
cows besides a chariot; this gift he should make bootless by returning
it to the giver.” In reference to these marriage-rites, the word “Sale”
can apply only in a metaphorical sense; as such union is effected under
the law.’

098	Even a Sudra ought not to take a nuptial fee, when he gives away his daughter; for he who takes a fee sell his daughter, covering (the transaction by another name).
