This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 19), which adds
the following explanation:—‘Just as the earth supports all sorts of
beings, animate and inanimate, high and low,—so also does the king
protect all men, those who are capable of paying taxes as well as the
poor and the distressed; and this is called his *Pārthiva-vrata*’.
