If urged by carnal desire, men should wed women belonging to the same
caste as themselves, or those belonging to other castes, then their
‘*seniority*’ shall depend upon ‘*the order of their castes*,’— and not
upon age, nor upon the order of their age.

‘*Honour*’—consisting in the presenting of fruits and other things.

‘*The order of the caste*’ is that the Brāhmaṇa-wife comes first, then
the *Kṣatriya*, then the *Vaiśya*.

‘*Habitation*’—*i.e*., the principal apartments. This belongs to the
Brāhmaṇa-wife.

Among wives of the same caste, all this is governed by the order of
their marriage.—(85)

*Cf*. the Mahābhārata 13.47.31.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 509), as laying
down the order in which the several wives of a man are to be
honoured;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 298) as declaring who is to be regarded
as the ‘Senior’ wife,

‘*Jyesṭhā*’;—also in Vol. II, p. 191;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 419),
which explains ‘*svāḥ*’ as ‘belonging to the same caste as her husband,’
and ‘*svāvarāḥ*’ (which is its reading for ‘*aparāḥ*’) as ‘belonging to
a different caste’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 198a);—and by
*Jīmūtavāhana* (Dāyabhāga, p. 257), which says that the wife of one’s
own caste, even though married later, would be the *Senior* and hence
entitled to associate with the husband in his religious acts.

**(verses 9.85-87)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (26.1-4).—‘If a man has several wives of his own caste, he shall
perform his religious duties with the eldest wife. If he has several
wives of diverse castes, he shall perform them, even with the youngest
wife, if she is of the same caste as himself. On failure of a wife of
his own caste, be shall perform them with one belonging to the caste
next below his own; so also in cases of distress;—but no twice-born man
shall ever do it with a Śūdra wife.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.88).—‘So long as a wife of the same caste as himself is
alive, he shall not have his religious acts done by another; and among
several wives of the same caste, the younger one shall not be employed
in religious acts, except along with the eldest.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 420).—‘If a man has several wives, he
should have his religious acts, such as the tending of the Sacrificial
Fire, done by one who belongs to the same caste as himself; if there are
several of the same caste as himself, then by the eldest among them, if
she is not defective; or by one who has given birth to a heroic son and
is most obedient to him, skilful, sweet-speaking and pure.’
