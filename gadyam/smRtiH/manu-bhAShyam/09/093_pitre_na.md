This prohibits the payment of nuptial fees in the case of the girl who
has reached puberty, and who is intended to be given away for a fee; and
the reason for this is that—‘*he would fall off from his ownership*.’ It
is only during *childhood* that the girl is to live under the tutilage
of her father; so that when she is taken away by a man after she has
reached a higher age,—the father’s ownership over her has ceased.

Even in the case of a girl who is not intended to be given away for a
fee, the father’s ownership ceases,—the grounds for such cessation
(*i.e*., the girl having reached the higher age) being equally present
in her ease also.

‘*Falling off*’ means *cessation*.

‘*Thwarting*’—impeding its fruition in the shape of bearing children.

Some people say that this verse does not belong to Manu.—(93)

*Cf*. 3, 23, 24, 51 and 52; 8.366;—9, 46, 71, 97 and 98;—11.62.

“*According to some people*, this verse does not form part of the text
of Manu”—says Medhātithi. This is not his own opinion, as Hopkins
wrongly asserts.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 772);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 149);—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 223);—in *Aparārka*
(p. 94), which explains ‘*śulka*’ as the *price*;—and in *Smṛtikaumudī*
(p. 38).

*Viṣṇu* (24.41).—‘A girl, whose menses begin to appear while she is
living at her father’s house, before she has been betrothed to a man,
has to be considered as a degraded woman; by taking her without the
consent of her kinsmen, a man commits no wrong.’

093	But he who takes (to wife) a marriageable damsel, shall not pay any nuptial fee to her father; for the (latter) will lose his dominion over her in consequence of his preventing (the legitimate result of the appearance of) her enemies.
