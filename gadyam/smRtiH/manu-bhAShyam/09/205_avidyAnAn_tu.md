But if all of them are unlearned, and the property is acquired by their labour,—the division in that case shall be equal, the property being not ancestral. such is the settled rule.—(205)

‘*Unlearned*’—*i.e*., devoted to agriculture, trade, service of the king
and so forth.

In this case no intention is to be paid to the larger or smaller amount
of property acquired by them. But even so, if some one of them happens
to acquire a very large property, that of course is not to be divided
among others.

This verse is in reality meant to be prohibitive of the ‘preferential
share’ of the eldest, brother.

If the difference in the properties acquired by them is small, the
shares shall be equal.

‘*The property being not ancestral*’;—the addition of this reason
clearly indicates that this same rule applies also to the ease of the
property of a childless person.—(205)

‘*Apitrye*’.—This is construed by Nandana as *apitryaḥ* in the sense
‘since the division has not been made by the father’;—this rule refers
to acquisitions by trade (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa), by
agriculture (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nandana), or service of the king
(Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 507), which explains the
meaning to be as follows:—In a case where all the brothers are
unlearned, if they acquire wealth, this wealth, which is not inherited
from the father, is to be divided equally among them, and there is not
to be any additional share to any one on the ground of any additional
amount of work that he may have done.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 57), which has the following
notes:—‘*Īhā*,’ agriculture and the rest,—‘*apitrye*,’ which does not
form part of the ancestral property.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 727);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta,
p. 137), which explains ‘*īhā*’ as ‘agriculture and the rest,’—and
‘*samaḥ*’ as ‘not unequal,’ which precludes the special share of 20 per
cent.

205	But if all of them, being unlearned, acquire property by their labour, the division of that shall be equal, (as it is) not property acquired by the father; that is a settled rule.
