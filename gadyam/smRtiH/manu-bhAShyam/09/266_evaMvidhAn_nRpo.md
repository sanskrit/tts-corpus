**(verse 9.264)  
**

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 336), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Apūpaśālā*’ is the place where cakes are
sold;—‘*veśa*,’ the house of the prostitute;—‘*madyānnavikraya*,’ places
where wines and grains are sold;—‘*caityavṛkṣa*,’ large
tree;—‘*samāja*,’ must be taken as standing for assemblages other than
the ordinary ‘*sabhā*’ or meeting place, this latter having been already
mentioned; such other assemblages also are likely to be frequented by
thieves; —‘*prekṣaṇa*’ are places of dancing and other amusements.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 841).

**(verse 9.265)**

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 841);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 336), which explains ‘*Kārukāveśanāni*’ as the shops of artisans.

**(verse 9.266)  
**

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 841);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 336), which adds the following notes:—‘*Gulmaiḥ*’, companies of
soldiers;—these are qualified by the epithet ‘*sthāvarajaṅgamaiḥ*’; the
meaning thus is ‘by companies of soldiers, located in a fixed place; as
well as, operating in moving columns’;—‘*cāraiḥ etc*.,’ for the
prevention of theft the king should have all possible haunts of thieves
watched by spies.

*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara, pp. 335 and 337).—‘The King shall search for
thieves on roads passing on boundaries, and in places inhabited by
dishonest men as bad as thieves; he shall make a search in villages
through Caṇḍālas and executioners and other persons who may he in the
habit of moving about at night...... He shall have the thieves shadowed
by variously disguised spies clover in the art of catching thieves, and
other trustworthy persons. These spies shall employ by gifts those who
have been thieves in the past, and with the advice of these men, they
shall arrange to meet the thieves. If some of these do not come to meet
them, they shall be at once arrested along with their sons and
relations.’
