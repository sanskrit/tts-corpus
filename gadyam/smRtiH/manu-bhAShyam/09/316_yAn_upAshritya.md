**लोकास्** त्रयः पृथिव्यादयः । **देवा** आहुतिद्वारेण ब्राह्मणोपाश्रिताः । अध्यापनाधिक्येन कर्मबहुत्वेन ब्राह्मणो देवानाम् आश्रयः, न तथा क्षत्रियवैश्यौ ॥ ९.३१६ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Worlds*’—the three regions, the earth and the rest.

‘*Gods*’—are dependent upon the Brāhmaṇas, through the libations offered
by these latter. The Gods are ‘dependent’ upon the Brāhmaṇas also, in
the sense that the greater part of Vedic teaching and Vedic rites are
done by them;—the *Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya* not doing them to the same
extent.—(316)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 151), which
explains ‘*Brahma chaiva dhanam yeṣām*’ as that for the Brāhmaṇa the
Veda is the sole treasure, inasmuch as it is the Veda that accomplishes
all prosperity for them, and becomes the means of acquiring wealth by
teaching and sacrificing; and as such the Veda should be acquired and
guarded;—what man, wishing to live, shall give trouble to such
Brāhmaṇas?
