हीनजातीयाप्य् **अक्षमाला** **वसिष्ठ**भार्या तत्संयोगाद् **अभ्यर्हणीयतां** प्राप्ता । **शारङ्गी** तिर्यग्जातिः चटका **मन्दपालेन** मुनिना संयुक्ता तथैव पूज्या । अतो हीनजातीयाः कनीयस्यो ऽपि भूयो भर्तृवत् पूज्याः । तथा चोक्तम् "वयसि स्त्रियः" इति ॥ ९.२३ ॥

Even though born of a low caste, Akṣamālā, the wife of Vaśiṣṭha, became,
through that union, ‘*worthy of worship*’.

Similarly the ‘*doe*’ though an animal, on becoming united with the sage
Mandapāla, ‘*became worthy of worship*.’

Thus it is that even low-born women, belonging to the lower castes, came
to be honoured like their husbands; as it has been said that ‘women are
honoured by their age’.—(23).
