It has been declared above that—‘when the nuptial fee has been received,
and the giver of the fee has died, the girl may be given to another man,
if she consents.’ This is what is forbidden by the present text,—*i.e*.,
the act. of promising the girl to man who has paid the fee, and then to
give her to another after receiving a fee from him.

What is meant is that in such cases the girl should be made to choose
her own husband.—(99)
