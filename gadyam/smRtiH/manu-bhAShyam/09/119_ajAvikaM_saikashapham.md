‘*Animal with uncleft hoofs*;’—such as the horse, the mule, the ass etc.
When the number of cattle available do not admit of division in equal
numbers, then the odd animal should be given to the eldest brother; and
its value shall not be made good by giving (to the other brothers) other
things, nor shall the animal be sold and its value distributed among the
brothers equally.

‘*Ajāvikam*;’—the singular form is justified on the ground of its being
a copulative compound standing for animals.—(119)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.119), to the effect that of the
animals mentioned, if an odd one remains after partition, it is to be
given to the eldest brother;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 686), to the same
effect;—in *Aparārka* (p. 723), which explains ‘*viṣamam*’ as a number
different from (not a multiple of) the number of brothers;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 498), which says that the odd animals are not to
be partitioned by being sold and the value divided, they should be taken
by the eldest brother;—and in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 57).

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.9).—‘The additional share of the eldest brother is a
cow, a horse, a goat and a sheep, respectively, for the four castes.’

अजाविकं तु विभागकाले यदि विअमसंख्यया विभक्तुम् अशक्यं तज् जेष्ठस्यैव स्यात् । न तद् अन्यस्य द्रव्यांशपातेन समतां नयेत्, विरीय वा तन्मूल्यं खण्डयेत् ॥ ९.११९ ॥

<details><summary>Bühler</summary>

119	Let him never divide (the value of) a single goat or sheep, or a (single beast) with uncloven hoofs; it is prescribed (that) a single goat or sheep (remaining after an equal division, belongs) to the eldest alone.
