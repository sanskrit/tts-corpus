That is to say, any harm coming to the King’s own army is more serious
than that of the Ally. If he is himself fully fit, the King can go to
the rescue of his Ally.

Similarly as between the Treasury and the Army,—injury to the Treasury
means positive injury to the Army.

And between ‘Treasury’ and the ‘People,’—if the People are injured,
whence would the ‘Treasury’ derive its existence? Similarly when the
whole People are in danger, all effort should be concentrated on the
saving of the ‘Capital City,’ as it is there that all the accessories of
the kingdom can he brought together. The ‘Minister’ again is more
important than the ‘Capital City;’ as the destruction of the Chief
Minister may bring destruction to the entire kingdom.—(295)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 278), which
explains ‘*vyasanam*’ as ‘*vyasanakāraṇam*’, ‘source of trouble’—and
adds that these are so only when they defective.—It is quoted again on
p. 319, where the same notes are repeated and ‘*prakṛtīnām*’ is
explained as ‘among the factors’.
