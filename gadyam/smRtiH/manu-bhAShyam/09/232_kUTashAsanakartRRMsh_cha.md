‘*Forgers of Royal proclamations*’—give out as done by the king what is
not done by him. ‘*Proclamations*’—royal edicts such orders as ‘No one
shall eat at the house of such and such a person’, ‘such and such a
favour has been conferred upon this man’, ‘such is the law that has been
laid down by the king’, and so forth—are always entered upon a piece of
paper, written by the hand of the royal scribe, and are then known as
the ‘Royal proclamation’. And people may forge these—*i.e*.,
misrepresent them.

‘*Sowers of disaffection among the people*’,—who spread disaffection
among such of the people as may have some grievance or may be too greedy
and so forth;—also the slayers of woman and infants and of
Brāhmnṇas;—‘those that serve his enemies’—secretly carrying on visits to
them.—(232)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 862), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Prakṛtīnām*,’ of the various ‘members’ of the
state;—‘*dviṭsevinaḥ*,’ those who serve persons disloyal to the
king;—and in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 370), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Śāsana*’ here stands for royal proclamations;—‘*prakṛtīnām*,’
of the Minister and other members of the State;—‘*dūṣakān*,’ defamers
without justification, those who attribute delinquencies, when in
reality, there are none;—‘*dviṭsevinaḥ*,’ persons serving men inimical
to the king.

*Viṣṇu* (5.9, 11).—‘The King shall put to death those who forge royal
edicts;—and those who forge private documents;—and also poisoners,
incendiaries, robbers, killers of women, children or men;—those stealing
more than ten

*Kumbhas* of grain,—or more than a hundred *māṣas* of things sold by
weight;—also those who aspire to sovereignty, though being of low birth;
breakers of dikes, and such as give shelter to robbers; and a woman who
is unfaithful to her lord.’

*Viṣṇu* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 370).—‘One who tries to contaminate the
limbs of the kingdom—Minister, etc., and the people—should be put to
death.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.240).—‘One who forges weighing scales, royal edicts,
weights and measures, or coins,—and one who deals with these,—should be
fined the highest amercement.’

Do. (2.294).—‘One who subtracts from or adds to a royal edict, and one
who lets go an adulterer or a thief,—should be fined the highest
amercement.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Aparārka, p. 862).—‘One who makes use of a forged
document, or disobeys a royal edict, and deals with short weights and
measures should suffer corporal punishment or cutting off of a limb.’

evidence or by means of a forged seal, should he fined with the highest
amercement.’
