*Yājñavalkya* (2.126).—‘If after partition it is discovered that some
properties have been in the exclusive possession of one or other of the
co-parceners,—they shall divide all such properties again in equal
shares.’

*Kātyāyana* (Aparārka, p. 732).—‘If any property had remained concealed
at the time of partition, and is subsequently discovered, it shall be
divided by the man in possession among his brothers.—If the partition is
found to have been wrongly made,—or if such properties are subsequently
discovered as have been in the possession of one or other of the
co-parceners,—or if some property that had been lost is recovered,—they
shall make another division.’

*Bṛhaspati* (25.96).—‘When the loan or mortgaging of a joint property is
concealed with a fraudulent purpose, the King shall recover it from the
cheat by artifice, but not use violence to extort it from him.’
