‘*Possessing*,’—ruling over.

“When the King brought about the confusion of castes, how can he be
called the chief of royal sages?”

The answer is that possessing the whole Earth, he was a great King, but
he had his ‘*mind*’— mental equanimity—‘*besat*’—destroyed—‘*by*
*lust*’—in the shape of carnal desires and so forth.—(67)
