This verse serves to eulogise the expedients going to be described.

‘*Forcibly*’—by shutting them up by force in a harem or by banishing
other men, and so forth—they cannot be guarded.

But they can be guarded by the employment of expedients;—*i.e*., by
employing, making use of, these ‘*expedients*’, means.—(10)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 416);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 323), which adds the explanation;—‘Inasmuch as it is not
possible to guard them

by force, they should be employed in such work as will not leave them
time for thinking of other men;—thus would they be guarded against
evil;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 192);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra,
32a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 158b), which explains
‘*prasahya*’ as ‘by force, by keeping cooped up’; it adds that what is
meant is that even though by forcible detention you can guard her body
from misbehaviour, yet that cannot guard against the uṅcleanliness of
her mind.
