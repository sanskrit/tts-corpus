‘*Sapiṇḍāt*’.—“In the text the word is masculine. Kullūka begins by
taking it generally as masculine or feminine, then, after giving the law
of inheritance for the sons, he begins by taking the wife as the first
female inheritor, quotes seven verses of Bṛhaspati and Vṛddha Manu, and
also Yājñvalkya (2.135-136) to prove the statement; and ends by giving a
list of female *sapiṇḍas*, after denouncing Medhātithi, because he
denies the wife the right of sharing the inheritance”.—Hopkins.

Rāghavānanda agrees, in substance, with Kullūka; but in order to make
the rule still more fully agree with Yājñavalkya (2. 35-136), he asserts
that the cognates (Bandhus) are also implied by the term
‘sakulya’.—According to Nandana, the ‘sakulyas’ are *Samānadakas*.

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.136), as
lending support to the view that among brothers, the first claim is that
of the uterine one, those born of other mothers being a step further
removed;—in *Aparārka* (p. 744) to the effect that the *nearer sapiṇḍa*
has the prior claim,—‘nearness’ having been described under 186.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 592), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Anantaraḥ*’, near,—‘*dhanam*’, of the man without
son,—‘*sakulya*’ here stands for *Samānadaka*;—in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p.
63), in support of the view that the claim of the *sister* comes next to
that of the grandmother (paternal);—in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 195), which
explains the meaning to be that ‘from among the Sapiṇḍas of the dead
man, the *nearest* will inherit his property’;—in *Dāyakramasaṅgraha*
(pp. 10 and 28);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 40b);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 570 and 662);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(Calcutta, p. 154);—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 332), which,
explains ‘*sakulya*’ as ‘beyond the Sapiṇḍa’, and also as ‘the
descendant of great-great-grandfather’.
