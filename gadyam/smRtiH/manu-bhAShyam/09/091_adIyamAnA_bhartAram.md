When a maiden, when not given away, herself procures a husband, she incurs no sort of sin; nor does the man whom she weds.—(91)

वर्षत्रयाद् ऊर्ध्वम् **अदीयमाना** यं **भर्तारं** वृणुते तस्य दोषो न । कन्यायाः पूर्वेणैव दोषाभाव उक्ते व्रियमाणस्य दोषार्थम् इदम् । ऋतुदर्सनं च द्वादसवर्षाणाम् इति स्मर्यते ॥ ९.९१ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

After three years, if not given away, if the girl chooses a
husband,—then, no sort of guilt accrues either to the girl or to the
man.

That the girl incurs no sin having been already mentioned in the
foregoing verse, the present verse is added for the purpose of declaring
that there is none on the part of the bridegroom either.

Puberty has been declared to be reached by girls when they are twelve
years old.—(91)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 772);—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 484), which says that the meaning is that
the man whom she takes as husband does not incur any sin in marrying
her;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 805), which explains the last clause to mean
that the man also incurs no sin;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 217),
which has the same note;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 501) which
explains ‘*adīyamānā*’ as ‘not given away’, either on account of the
absence of a giver, or on account of the giver, though present, being
disregarded, and reproduces Mādhava’s explanation.
