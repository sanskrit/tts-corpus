‘*Sons born of the wives of the same caste*.’— Sons born of mothers of
the same caste as the father are entitled to inherit the whole property.

‘*Born of diverse wives*’;—*i.e*., of wives belonging to diverse castes.

This is what is now going to be expounded.

‘*Severed*’— this is a mere reiteration.

Others however attach special significance to this epithet (‘several’)
also; the sense being that in the case of partition among sons born of
*several* wives belonging to diverse castes, the rule is as going to be
set forth (in 153),—*viz*., ‘The Brāhmaṇa son shall take four shares
etc., etc.’ As for a *single* wife of a *different* caste,—no man ever
has recourse to any such; hence she does not count in the present
connection.—(148)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 527), which adds that
‘*ekayoniṣu*’ means ‘those belonging to the same caste’, ‘*ekajātānām*’,
‘begotten by one man’,—‘*bahvīṣu*’, ‘on wives belonging to diverse
castes’;—and notes that ‘*ekajātānām*’ is to be construed with
‘*bahvīṣu*’ also.
