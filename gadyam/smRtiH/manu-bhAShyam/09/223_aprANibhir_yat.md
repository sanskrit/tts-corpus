This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 610);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 388), which explains ‘*aprāṇibhiḥ*,’ as ‘by dice,
leather-tablets, sticks and so forth,’ and ‘*prāṇibhiḥ*’, as ‘by cocks
and other animals’;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 27);—in *Aparārkā*, p. 802;—in
*Mitākṣarā* (2. 199);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 153), which adds
the following notes—‘*Aprāṇibhiḥ*’, with dice, tablets and so
forth;—‘*prāṇibhiḥ*’ with rams, cocks and other animals;—‘gambling’ and
‘prize-fighting’ are names applicable to only such acts as are
accompanied by betting; where there is no betting, the act is called
‘sport’ and not deprecated among people;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
333);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 44b); in *Vivādacintāmaṇī*

like—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 19);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra 223b).

223	When inanimate (things) are used (for staking money on them), that is called among men gambling (dyuta), when animate beings are used (for the same purpose), one must know that to be betting (samahvaya).
