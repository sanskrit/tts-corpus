‘*Form*’—as prescribed in the scriptures; what is done in accordance
with this—*i.e*., as laid down in 3.35 *et-seq*,—where the use of water
has been held by some to be meant for the case of maidens.

When one has, according to this form, accepted a maiden,—he may
‘*repudiate*, *her*’—before marriage is done.

‘*Blemished*’—disfigured by evil bodily marks, not perceived before.
Even though she may have been accepted, and be very handsome, yet if she
be found to be wanting in modesty, or harsh of tongue.

‘*Diseased*’— suffering from consumption.

‘*Corrupted*’—one who is known among men as suffering from an incurable
disease, or as being in love with another man.

Such a girl one may repudiate.

Some people have explained ‘*vipraduṣṭā*’ as ‘deflowered.’

This however is not accepted by others as right. So long as the girl has
not been enjoyed by a man, and as such remains a ‘maiden,’ she cannot be
regarded as ‘corrupted’; and after she has been enjoyed, she is no
longer a ‘maiden’; so that in this case there could be no sense in the
assertion that ‘one may repudiate the corrupted *maiden*.’ And the
abandoning of the ‘deflowerd’ girl has been already laid down before
(under 8.226).

‘*Betrothed by deception*’—actually wanting in limbs, or having
superfluous limbs.

Since the text mentions the presence of defects as the ground for
repudiation, it follows that even in the presence of such minor defects
as are not mentioned here,—one may abandon the girl, even after
betrothal.—(72)

‘*Vipraduṣṭām*’—‘Blemished, by bodily defects’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka,
Rāghavānanda and Nandana); ‘belonging to a base family’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 492), to the effect
that it is not only the giver of a defective maiden that is to be
punished, but the girl herself is to be renounced in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 154), which adds the following notes:—‘*Vipraduṣṭā*’ is one who
entertains longings for another man,—‘*Chadmanā*’, by showing to the
bridegrom a girl other than the one to be married;—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 744), which adds the following notes:—

‘*Vigarhitām*’, already previously married, but ‘impenetrated;’ it
quotes Medhātithi’s words as ‘*pūrvam pratigṛhītām akṣatayonimapi*’;
‘*vipraduṣṭām*,’ having her affections centred in another man;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 106), which explains ‘*vigarhitām*,’ as
‘defective’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 221), as laying down
the divorcing of a girl, after the detection of some defect in her,—it
explains ‘*vipraduṣṭām*’ as ‘*vividham prakarṣeṇa duṣṭām*,’ ‘having
*several serious* defects.’

**(verses 9.72-73)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (5.162).—‘The punishment of a thief is ordained for a suitor
abandoning a girl after betrothal, if she is free from blemish.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.66).—‘If a man gives away a girl without mentioning her
defects, he should be fined with the highest amercement; but the man
that abandons a faultless girl betrothed to him should be punished; and
if he falsely attributes defects to her, he should be fined one
hundred.’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 96).—‘After having accepted a maiden free from
defects, if the man abandons her, he should he punished; and even though
he may desire another maiden he should marry the same former maiden.’

Do. (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 745).—‘One shall not find fault with a
faultless bride, or with a faultless bridegroom; but if the fault is
there, there is nothing wrong in mentioning it and abandoning one
another.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do.).—‘If a man marries a girl without proclaiming his own
defects, or asks for her hand, he shall not obtain her, even though she
may have been betrothed to him. In the same manner if the girl is
subsequently found to have defects, the giver of her shall be punished.’
