<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The king shall ‘*establish*’—place—houses of incarceration on all
well-known roads,—where the ‘*suffering offenders might be seen*;’—this
implies that the position of the prisons shall be so arranged as to fall
within such places as are passed by ordinary passers-by; and it follows
from this that various forms of torture shall be inflicted on the
prisoners.

‘*Disfigured*’—the condition of their body being altered by either total
starving or reduced rations.

The rest is quite clear.—(288)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 630), which explains
‘*bandhanāni*’ as ‘places of imprisonment.’
