<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When one, with a view to making a profit, adulterates a commodity,
which, by itself, is quite pure—*e.g*., when the dealer in grains mixes
straw and dust with grains harvested quite clean; or when one
adulterates saffron and other such substances with foreign substances.

‘*Gems*’—Pearls and the rest.

‘*Breaking*’—into pieces.

‘*Wrongly boring*’—*i.e*., boring at a place where boring should not be
done. ‘*Apavedha*’—is also derived from the root ‘*vyadh*’, to *pierce*;
the denotation of verbal roots being manifold.

Gems are classed as ‘good,’ ‘bad’ and ‘indifferent;’ and the punishment
shall be regulated in accordance with the class to which the gem in
question may belong; in the case of ‘indifferent’ gems, the fine shall
consist of the ‘middlemost amercement,’ and in that ‘good’ ones it shall
consist of the ‘highest amercement’—(286)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 362), which adds the
following notes:—For spoiling unspoilt articles by adulterating them
with defective articles,—for boring such gems as are broken by the
boring,—and for the wrong boring of pearls and such gems,—the fine is
the ‘first amercement’.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 821);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta,
p. 100).

**(verses 9.286-287)**

*Viṣṇu* (5.124).—‘The highest amercement shall be paid by one who sells
adulterated commodities.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.245-246).—‘If one adulterates with inferior substances,
such commodities as medicines, oils, salts, perfumes, grains and
molasses, shall be fined 16 *Paṇas*.—In the case of such commodities as
skins, earthen-ware, gems, yarns, iron, wood, tree-bark and cloth, if
one sells by misrepresenting the quality, he should he made to pay a
fine eight times the value of the commodity sold.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Aparārka, p. 826).—‘If one, by polishing up a cheap article
to look like a valuable article, cheats women and children, he should he
lined in accordance with the nature of the article concerned. Those who
make and sell artificial gold, pearls or corals should be made to refund
the price to the buyer and pay to the King double the amount as a fine.’

Do. (Vivādaratnākara, p. 297).—‘If one sells commodities adulterated
with articles whose defects are concealed, or burnished up so as to look
new, should be made to pay double the price to the buyer, and also an
equal amount as fine.’
