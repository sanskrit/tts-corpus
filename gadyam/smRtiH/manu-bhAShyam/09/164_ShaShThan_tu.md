<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It being possible for men to entertain the notion that, like the
‘bought’ son, the ‘*Kṣetraja*’ (‘soil-born’) son also is entitled to
subsistence only,—the text lays down the optional alternative that he
may receive a share out of the property. What the exact share shall be
shall depend upon the man’s qualifications.—(164)
</details>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This rule refers to the case where the *Kṣetraja* was born before the
‘body-bom’ son, and received no property from his progenitor-father
(Rāghavānanda);—It refers to the case where a man dying leaving several
widows, one of those is ‘commissioned’ to bear a son, while another
gives birth to a ‘body-born’ son (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 543), which adds that the
option of ‘fifth’ and ‘sixth’ share is meant to be determined by the
presence or absence of good qualifications in the *Kṣetraja* son
concerned;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 348), which deduces the
following conclusion:—If the *Kṣetraja* son is endowed with
exceptionally good qualifications, he receives a fourth share; if he is
devoid of good qualities and also unfriendly to the ‘body-born’ son,
then only a sixth share; if he is only devoid of qualities, but not
unfriendly,—or if is he unfriendly but not devoid of qualities,—then a
fifth share,—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyahhāga*, p. 229).

belong to the same caste shall obtain a one-third share of the estate.’

*Bṛhaspati* (see above under 163).

Do. (Vivādaratnākara, p. 545).—‘The son begotten on one’s wife through

parts.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 544).—‘When the body-born son is born,

the son of the apppointed daughter, and the other sixteen parts to the
body-born son.’
