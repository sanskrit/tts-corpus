‘*Utkṛṣṭāyci-abhirupāya*.’—The first term qualifies the second; and the
meaning is ‘who is of exceptionally distinguished appearance.’—Or, the
two terms may be taken as two distinct qualifications—‘*utkṛṣṭāya*’
meaning ‘one whose caste and other qualifications are remarkable,’ and
‘*abhirūpāya*’ meaning ‘handsome’;—the literal signification of the term
being ‘*rūpam ābhimukhyena prāptaḥ*,’ ‘who has acquired a good
appearance.’—Or, ‘*abhirūpāya*’ may mean *well-disposed*; it is in this
sense that a learned man also is called ‘*abhirūpa*.’

‘*Equal*’—in caste and other matters.

‘*Bridegroom*’—one who marries; the son-in-law.

‘*She who has not attained*’;—*i.e*., who has no carnal desires aroused,
who is still too young, not having reached the youthful age,—called
‘*nagnikā*’ in another *Smṛti-text*; *i.e*., one in whom the sexual
instinct has not arisen, who is only eight or six years old,—but not a
mere *infant*; as is indicated by the qualifications (elsewhere)—‘one
who is eight years old.’ This same qualification may also be indicative
of the fact that marriage is meant to be conducive to spiritual merit If
mere Lust were the sole inducement to Marriage, wherefore could there be
any marriage of the girl ‘*who has not attained her age*’?

There is no force however in this; as people are found to many very
young girls with a view to her dowry. And it has been fully explained
under Discourse III that all forms of activity are not in accordance
with what is laid down in the scriptures.—(88)

‘*Aprāptām*’—‘Who has not attained the marriageable age,’ (Medhātithi
and Rāghavānanda);—‘who has not attained eight years of age’ (Kullūka
and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 481), which
explains ‘*aprāptām*’ as ‘one whose marriage time has not arrived, *i*.
*e*., who is still a child’;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 124), which
explains ‘*aprāptām*’ as ‘one who has not attained the age that is most
commended for marriage’;—in *Vīramitrodya* (Saṃskāra, p. 755), which
reproduces the explanation of ‘*aprāptām*’ given in
*Parāśaramādhava*;—in *Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 39), as countenancing the
marrying of a girl even before she is of the proper age;—in
*Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 30) to the same effect;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
103), which explains ‘*aprāptām*’ as ‘one who has not attained the right
age,’ who may be given away in consideration of the special
qualifications of the bridegroom.

**(verses 9.88-89)**

*Gautama* (18-21).—‘A girl should be given in marriage before puberty.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (17.70).—‘Out of fear of the appearance of the menses, let
the father marry his daughter while she still runs about naked. For if
she stays in the home after the age of puberty, sin falls on the
father.’

*Baudhāyana* (4. 1.11).—‘Let him give his daughter, while she still goes
about naked, to a man who has not broken the vow of chastity and who
possesses good qualities, or even to one destitute of good qualities;
let him not keep the maiden in his house after she has reached the age
of puberty.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 754).—‘Family, character, beautiful
body, age, learning, wealth, presence of guardians,—these seven
qualifications should he sought for before a girl is given away; nothing
else need he considered.’

*Lalla* (Do.).—‘Caste, learning, age, character, health, large family,
wealth, Brahmanic character,—these eight should he the qualities of the
Bridegroom.’

*Gautama* (Do.).—‘One should give away his daughter to a man who is
endowed with learning, character, relations and good conduct.’

*Śātātapa* (Do., p. 755).—‘That bridegroom should he selected who is
seeking for a wife and is endowed with good family and character,
handsome, learned, intelligent and young, and free from defects.’
