This verse precludes the idea that the son of the elder brother begotten
by the method of ‘authorisation’ is entitled to the ‘preferential share’
that would have been his father’s.

‘*The division in that case shall equal*’—That is, there shall be no
‘preferential share;’ nor shall the eldest receive ‘one more’ (as laid
down in 117), or the ‘some trifle’ (laid down in 115).

It shall be equal:—equal to whom? To that of his begetter—his younger
uncle.

The son horn without ‘authorisation’ is not entitled to any share,—as is
going to be declared later on.

This text, is indicative of the rule that when the brother is not alive,
the division shall be between the surviving brother and his nephew.

This verse in quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.136), which says that this refers
to cases where the brothers (the one dead and his younger brother who
beget the son on bis sister-in-law)were not divided, while verse 146
below pertains to cases where they have been divided;—and in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 542), which adds the following explanation:—The
undivided elder brother having died without a son, if the younger
brother begets, by commission, a son on his widow, then, when there
comes about partition between this son and his uncle-progenitor, it will
be done in equal shares, and the son shall not obtain any special share
by reason of his dead father having been the elder brother.
