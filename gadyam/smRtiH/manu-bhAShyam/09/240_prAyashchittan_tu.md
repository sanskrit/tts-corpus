‘*Senior castes*’—All castes other than *Śūdras*. If they perform the
prescribed expiatory penances, there is to be no branding; and their
punishment shall consist of the ‘highest amercement;’ that is they
should be made to pay a thousand ‘*paṇas*.’— (240)

‘*Uttama-sāhasam*’ [see
8.138].

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 635);—in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 102);—in *Mitākṣarā*, (under 2.270);—and again
under 3.259, to the effect that the performance of expiatory rites is
necessary even when the culprit has paid a fine for his guilt (the
present text exonerating the man only from branding);—in
*Vyavāhāra-Bālambhāṭṭī* (p. 117);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 120).
