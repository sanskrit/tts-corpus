What has been just said is further explained by means of an example.

‘*In one and the same plot*’— the particle ‘*api*’ being construed after
‘*kedāre*’—*i.e*., in one and the same field,—‘*sown in
season*’,—*i.e*., at the time that may be fit for each of the seeds
concerned,—‘*by the cultivators*,’—‘*spring forth in various
forms*’,—each seed being produced in its own peculiar form.

If the soil were the more important factor, all the products would have
been of one and the same quality; since the soil is one and the same for
all.—(38)
