They care not for beauty; they have no regard for age; be he handsome or ugly, they enjoy the man simply because he is a male.—(14)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The husband should not labour under the vain hope—‘I am well favoured,
handsome and young, how can my wife desire any other man, having
me?’;—because women do not take into consideration the fact of a man
being ‘handsome’ or ‘brave’; simply because he happens to be a male,
they have recourse to him.—(14)

**(verses 9.14-16)  
**

*Dakṣa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 413).—‘Women are like the leech; but while
the poor leech draws blood only, the woman draws your riches, your
property, your flesh, your virility and your strength. During
adolescence, she is in fear of the man, during youth, she demands
excessive pleasure, and when her husband becomes old, she does not care
a straw for him.’

*Rāmāyaṇa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 414).—‘For women there is no one loved
or hated; they betake themselves to all men; just as creepers growing in
a thick forest hang themselves on all trees.’

<details><summary>Bühler</summary>

014	Women do not care for beauty, nor is their attention fixed on age; (thinking), '(It is enough that) he is a man,' they give themselves to the handsome and to the ugly.
