The term ‘*yautaka*’ is applied to the separate property of a woman; of
which she alone is the sole owner.—Others apply it to only what she
receives at marriage, and not to all that belongs to her; it is only
over the former that she has an absolute right; as it is said that
‘women become their own mistresses, on obtaining presents at their
marriage.’

Others again hold that the term ‘*yautaka*’ applies to the savings that
the young woman makes out of what she receives from her husband for her
clothing and ornaments, and also for the daily household expenses.

‘*Is the share of the unmarried daughter only*.’—Since the text adds the
qualification ‘unmarried,’ it is clear that what is said here does not
apply to one who has been married. Further, the term ‘*eva*,’ ‘only,’
referring to what is well known, sets aside the implications of the
context; consequently, what is said here (regarding the mother’s
property) cannot apply to the ‘appointed daughter’ (who would be
*married*).

*Gautama*—after having declared that the woman’s property descends to
her children’ (28.24)—adds—‘To her daughters who are unmarried and
unsettled;’ where ‘unsettled’ stands for those who, though married, are
childless, and without any property of their own, not having obtained a
footing in the house of their husbands.

‘*The grandson alone is to inherit*’—the entire property of the man who
dies without a legitimate son. What would be the share of the grandson,
when the man dies leaving a legitimate son, shall he declared Inter on.

The term ‘*grandson*’ stands for *the son of the appointed daughter*, in
the present sentence only, not throughout the context; as it is only in
connection with the ‘mother’s separate property’ (mentioned in the first
half of the verse) that there is any authority for rejecting the
implications of the context (which refers to the *Appointed
Daughter*).—(131)

“According to Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa, all *Strīdhana* is
meant;—according to ‘others’ mentioned by Medhātithi, Nandana and
Rāghavānanda, the so-called ‘*saudāyika*’ or property derived from the
father’s family.”—Buhler.

‘*Kumārī*’—‘an unmarried daughter (Medhātithi and Kullūka);—‘a daughter
who has no sons’ (Nārāyaṇa).

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 517)
which adds the following notes:—‘*Yautakam*’ here stands for what has
been given to the girl at the time of her marriage, by her father and
other relatives. Halāyudha however holds that it stands for what has
been given to the woman for such household purposes as the purchase of
vegetables and other things, out of which, by her clever management, she
may have saved and increased by judicious handling. To such property of
the mother either the sons or the married daughters can have no right,
as a rule; but if among the married daughters there be such as are
childless or otherwise ill-conditioned, these are to have an equal share
in the property.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 372), which explains
‘*yautakam*’ as ‘property obtained from the father’s family’;—in
*Aparārka* (p. 721), to the effect that when the mother’s property comes
to be divided among her daughters, the unmarried ones have the
preference over the married ones;—in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 186), which
has the following note:—The term ‘*yautaka*’ is derived from the root
‘yu’ (to join), and hence signifying *junction*, or *union*, it stands
for ‘what is given at marriage’;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 631 and
750);—in *Dāyakramasaṅgraha* (p. 21);—and by *Jīmūtavāhana*
(*Dāyabhāga*, p. 132), which says ‘*yautakam*’ stands for the dowry
obtained at marriage,—this being indicated by the root ‘*yu*’ (to join)
from which the word is derived,—marriage being the ‘*joining*’ of the
husband and wife.
