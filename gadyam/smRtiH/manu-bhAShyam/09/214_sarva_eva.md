‘*Addicted to evil deeds*’— doing such acts as are forbidden.

When all the brothers are working for the benefit of the whole family,
if the eldest brother surreptitiously takes possession of and invests
the property, under the impression that he would show them the
‘principal’ if they ask for it,—then he should he made to hand over to
all the brothers, the principal along with the interest that may have
accrued to it. But if at the very outset, he lays the whole property
before his brothers and says openly—‘Here is the property, each of you
take your share, I shall separate mine and earn interest on it,’—then
they are not entitled to the interest thus earnad; which belongs
exclusively to the eldest brother, and forms his ‘special hoard.’—(214)

‘*Vikarmasthāḥ*.’—‘Addicted to gambling, drinking and similar vices’
(Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘who following despicable modes of living,
such as cattle-breeding, serving śūdras and the like’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Yautakam*.’—‘Separate hoarding’ (Medhātithi and Kullūka;—‘shall not,
out of the common property, give a dowry to his daughter’ (Nandana).

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 720 and p.
749);—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 480), where ‘*Vikarmasthāḥ*’ is explained
as ‘addicted to gambling and so forth’—and it is noted that others have
explained it as meaning ‘behaving in a manner calculated to ruin the
family’;—in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 73), in the sense that so long as
well-behaved sons are present, the property cannot go to the ill-behaved
ones;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 222a).
