<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Cows and horses, etc. are added here in order to prevent the notion
being entertained that the laws laid down here are meant only for
children; or it may be regarded as added for the purpose of precluding
the notion that they are meant to apply to only seeds, fruits and crops,
as is already known among people.

The same law applies to quadrupeds, and bipeds, as also to immovable
things.

‘*This*’—refers to what has been said in the preceding two
verses:—*viz*. (1) when there is no compact, the produce belongs to the
owner of the soil, and (2) when there is compact, it belongs to both.

Cows and the rest have been named only by way of illustration; the same
law applies to the cases of dogs, cats and other animals.

“Why then should the declaration in verse 50 have been made?”

It is only a reiteration of the well-known fact that birds and other
animals do not form the ‘property’ of men to the same extent as cows do.

‘*Slave girls*’—*i.e*., those acquired by the seven sources of slavery.

‘*Offspring*’— young ones born from their wombs.—(55)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 580), which explains ‘*eṣa
dharmaḥ*’, as ‘the principle that the owner of the seed does not obtain
the fruit;’—also in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 150), which adds that the term
‘*dāsī*’ here stands for the slave-girl married to another slave; the
child of such a slave-girl belongs to the owner of the girl, not to that
of the father;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 521 and 574).
