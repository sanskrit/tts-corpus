But others who have committed these offences unintentionally, deserve to have the entire property confiscated; and death, in the case of their being intentional.—(242)

इतरे क्षत्रियादयो वर्णा एतानि पापानि महापातकान्य् अकामतो ऽनिच्छया कृतवन्तः सर्वस्वहरणाः कार्याः । केचित् प्रायश्चित्तम् अपि कुर्वताम् एतद् दण्डं पूर्वेण वैकल्पिकम् इच्छन्ति कामतस् तेषां वध उक्तः । शूद्रस्याकामतो ऽङ्कनसर्वस्वहरणे कामतो वधः ॥ ९.२४२ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Others*’—*the Kṣatriyas* and other castes,—when they have committed
‘*these offences*’—the most heinous crimes,—‘*unintentionally*’— without
actually wishing it,—should have all their property confiscated.

Some people hold that this is another punishment laid down for those who
have performed the expiatory penances,—alternative to the. one
prescribed in the foregoing verse.

In the case of these crimes being committed ‘*intentionally*,’ death has
been prescribed as the penalty.

In the case of the *Śūdra*, if the crime has been committed
intentionally, there is to be ‘branding’ and ‘confiscation of the whole
property’; and if it has been done intentionally, he shall be put to
death.—(242)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

Persons who perform no penance shall have their property confiscated if
the crime was unintentional, and if it was intentional, they shall be
banished also. (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).—There is to be confiscation of
the entire property only in very bad cases, instead of the fine of 1,000
*Paṇas* prescribed under 240. (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

‘*Pravāsanam*.’—‘Death’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka and, Nandana); ‘banishment’
(Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānada, who criticise Medhātithi’s explanation).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 635);—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 118).
