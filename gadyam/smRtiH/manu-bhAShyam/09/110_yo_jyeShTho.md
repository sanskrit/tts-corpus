If the eldest brother behaves as the eldest brother, he is like a mother, and like a father. If however he does not behave like the eldest brother, he shall be honoured simply as a kinsman.—(110)

‘Behaving like the eldest brother’ consists (1) in treating the younger
brothers with love, like that towards a son,—(2) in supporting them and
looking after their property, like his own, and (3) in preventing them
from wrong acts?.

If he behaves otherwise, he should he honoured ‘*like a
kinsman*,’—*i.e*., like the maternal or paternal uncle; *i.e*., the
younger brothers shall stand up when they come up, and so forth. This
means that they shall not be entirely subservient to his wishes.—(110)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 457), which adds the
following notes:—The ‘behaviour of the eldest’ consists in lovingly
maintaining and taking care of the youngers;—‘*bandhuvat*’, like the
maternal uncle and other relations, he should be treated with respect,
and saluted and so forth, and he should not be treated
disrespectfully;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 513 and 691);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 172a).

110	If the eldest brother behaves as an eldest brother (ought to do), he (must be treated) like a mother and like a father; but if he behaves in a manner unworthy of an eldest brother, he should yet be honoured like a kinsman.
