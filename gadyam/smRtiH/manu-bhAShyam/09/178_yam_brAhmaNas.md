“The designation ‘a corpse’ indicates that his father derives imperfect
benefits from his offerings (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda),—or
that he is blameable (Rāghavānanda).”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Prāyaścitta, p. 38);—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 574), which adds the following notes:—‘*Pārayan*,’
conferring some benefits upon the man whom he regards as his father,—he
is called ‘*śava*’ ‘corpse,’ because of his being capable of conferring
very little benefit upon his father;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*, (pp.
552 and 688);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 38a);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra 189b)—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 220), which says
that this refers to the son of a Śūdra woman who is *not a married
wife*.

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.30).—‘He who is begotten, through lust, by a man of
the first twice-born caste on a Śūdra woman, is the *Pāraśava* son.’

caste is the sixth (among those who are kinsmen, not heirs.)’

*Viṣṇu* (15.27).—‘The son born of a non-descript woman,
*Yatra-kvacana-utpādita*, is the twelfth.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 42).—‘The son of a Brāhmaṇa father (and Śūdra mother)
is the *Niṣāda* or the *Pāraśava*.’

178	The son whom a Brahmana begets through lust on a Sudra female is, (though) alive (parayan), a corpse (sava), and hence called a Parasava (a living corpse).
