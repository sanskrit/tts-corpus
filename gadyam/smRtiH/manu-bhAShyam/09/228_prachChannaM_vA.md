The term ‘*vikalpaka*’ means *variants forms*.

It depends entirely upon the King’s wish. (?)

From the words ‘learn the law relating to gambling’ (221) onwards, there
are only two or three verses that are injunctive, the others are purely
declamatory.—(228)

“Rāghavānanda and Nandana point out that not only corporeal punishment
(according to verse 224), but also a fine may be inflicted,”—(Buhler).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 611), which explains
‘*yatheṣṭam*’ as ‘in accordance with the king’s wish’;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 153), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Yatheṣṭam*’ *i.e*. after duly examining the nature of the
guilt, whatever punishment,—corporal or monetary—the king decides to
inflict, that is to be regarded as lawful;—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 880).
