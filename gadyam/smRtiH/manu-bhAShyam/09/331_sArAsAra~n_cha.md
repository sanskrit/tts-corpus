‘*Commodity*’ stands for skins and other things put up for sale; the
*excellences and defects of these*,—*i.e*., ‘this article if kept for a
long time becomes spoilt,’ ‘this is lasting,’ ‘that is not lasting.’

‘In this country, large supplies of grains are available,—at this time
barley is profuse,’—‘such and such is the custom of this country,’—‘the
nature of the people is so and so—these are ‘*the advantages and
disadvantages relating to countries*’.

‘*Cattle-breeding*,’—*i.e*., such rules as that by using such and such
fodder, and giving such and such salts, cattle flourish better; and so
forth.—(331)
