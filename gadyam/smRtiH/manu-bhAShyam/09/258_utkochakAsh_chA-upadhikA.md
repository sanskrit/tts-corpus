Those who are addicted to taking bribes for doing some work for people,
at the royal Court or with ministers etc.

‘*Dissemblers*.’—efficient in the art of dissembling; saying one thing
and doing another; openly professing love and secretly doing injury.
These persons do not always accept anything; they simply win the
confidence of men by means of such tricks as—having come to know that a
certain business of the man is going to succeed, they go to them and say
‘I am going to do this work for you.’ They also make use of threats
sometimes.

‘*Gamblers*’—who carry on gambling as a means of adding to their income.

‘*Cheats*’—those who mislead people; having promised to do a certain
work, they do not do it; and having approached the people of the
village, they adopt various methods to cheat them out of their properly.
To this class belong the persons who are known as ‘*Śivamādhavas*’; they
make Śiva or Viṣṇu the means of living.

‘*Fortune-tellers*’—astrologers and foretellers;—or persons who approach
rich men with such words as ‘for your sake I shall win the favour of
Durgā or Sūrya or such other gods and goddesses,’ and making a living by
it. Or, the term may stand for those who make a living by pronouncing
the auspicious formula ‘May this be so.’

‘*Palmists*’— who read the character of men from their palms.—(258)

‘*Aupadhikāḥ*’.—‘Deceitful persons, who say one thing and do another’
(Medhātithi);—‘those who extort money by threats’ (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘those who cheat by using false weights and measures’
(Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

‘*Vañcakāḥ*.’—‘Cheats, those who promise to do some thing but don’t do
it’ (Medhātithi);—‘those who pretend to change base metals into precious
ones’ (Rāghavānanda and Kullūka);—‘men who take money under false
pretences’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Maṅgalādeśavṛttāḥ*’.—‘Astrologers and others who prescribe auspicious
rites etc.’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘men who live by
reciting auspicious hymns’ (Nārāyaṇa);—“those who pronounce the
auspicious formula ‘be it so’.” (‘others’ in Medhātithi.)

‘*Bhadrāprekṣaṇikāḥ*’.—‘Palmists who always praise the fortunes of
others’ (Medhātithi);—Nārāyaṇa, reading ‘*bhadrāścekṣaṇikāḥ*’, explains
‘*bhadrāḥ*’ as ‘persons who tempt women’, and ‘*īkṣanikāḥ*’ as actors
and the rest;—Kullūka and Rāghavānanda and Nandana adopt the same
reading and explain ‘*bhadrāḥ*’ as ‘hyprocritical men who pose as pious
men and cheat people’ and ‘*īkṣaṇika*’ as palmists.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 291), which adds the
following explanations:—‘*Aikṣaṇika*’ (which is its reading for
‘*īkṣanika*’), is that fortune-teller who makes money by making false
agreeable predictions.
