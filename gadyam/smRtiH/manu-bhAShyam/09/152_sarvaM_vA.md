“According to Nārāyaṇa this rule refers to the case where each of the
wives has several sons, while the preceding one is applicable where each
wife has one son only.—Rāghavānanda thinks that the first rule shall be

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 528), as containing the

(Vyavahāra, p. 353);—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 212).
