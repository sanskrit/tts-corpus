**यथाविधि** यथाशास्त्रम् । **अधिगमैनाम्**, यथा[^१७७] वैवाह्यो विधिस् तथा विवाह्य । वाचनिको ऽयं विवाहः । पुनर्भूश् च तथोच्यते । न वा व्यूढापि सती भार्या भवति । केवलं परार्थो ऽस्या वाचनिको विवाहः । तथा च दर्शयति- "न दत्वा कस्यचित् कन्यां पुनर् अन्यस्य दीयते" (म्ध् ९.७१) इति । नासौ देवराय दीयत इत्य् अर्थः । अदत्ता चास्वभूता कथम् इव भार्या भवेत् **शुक्लवस्त्राम्** । नियमो गमने, अन्यस्मिन्न् अपि नियोगे धर्मो ऽयम् इष्यते ॥ ९.७० ॥

‘*According to rule*’—in accordance with the rules laid down in the
scriptures.

‘*Has espoused her*’—This would be ‘espousal’ or ‘marriage’ only in
name; as the maiden in such a case would he called a ‘*punarbhū*,’ ‘a
remarried widow’; and even though married, she could not be a ‘wife’ (in
the real sense of the term); her marriage, which is nominal, being only
for a defenite purpose. That this is so is shown in the next
verse—‘Having given away his daughter to one man, one shall not give her
to another,’—which means, that she should not be given to her younger
brother-in-law either; and when she is not *given away*—and as such does
not become the property of the man—how could she he his ‘wife’?

‘*Clad in white garments*’;—this is a rule that is to be observed by the
man approaching the woman; it is to be observed also in other cases of
‘authorisation.’—(70)

This verse is quoted along with 69 in *Mitākṣarā* (2.127), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Yathāvidhi*,’ in accordance with the
scriptures,—‘*adhigamya*’, having married,—‘*anena vidhānena*,’ (of the
preceding verse) *i.e*., ‘besmearing himself with clarified butter, with
speech held in check and so forth’,—‘*śuklavastrām śucivratām*,’ with
her mind and body under full control,—‘*mithaḥ*,’ in secret,—shall
approach her once during each course, till conception takes place. It
proceeds to declare that all this does not make the woman the actual
‘wife’ of the brother-in-law; hence the child bora of this union belongs
to the real (*i.e*., the former) husband;—*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds that the
action of the brother-in-law is purely for the purpose of providing a
child for his dead brother; it goes on to add the following notes
Kullūka Bhaṭṭa remarks that the fact of the child born of the
intercourse here sanctioned belonging to the dead betrothed is clear
from the restriction imposed, that there is to be intercourse only
*once* during the course, and that also only until conception takes
place.—Having thus stated the view of the older writers, *Bālambhaṭṭī*
enters into a long discussion and comes to the conclusion that the
sanction of remarriage must refer to a regular *widow*—who loses her
real husband after full marriage, and not only after betrothal; and it
naively remarks that the opinion of the older writers is due to
prejudice against ‘*niyoga*,’ by reason of its having been forbidden
during the *Kaliyuga*.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 129), which also quotes Kullūka
Bhaṭṭa’s remark (quoted in *Bālambhaṭṭī* above). It goes on to add that
what is here laid down should be done only if the woman concerned is
willing to do it, not otherwise; as is clearly declared by Vaśiṣṭha.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 351);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 737).
