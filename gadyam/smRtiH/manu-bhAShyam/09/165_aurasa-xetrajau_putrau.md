The first half of this verse is only a reiteration of what has been
enjoined before, and not a distinct injunction; specially because the
‘soil-born’ son does not stand on an equal footing with the ‘body-born’
son.

The other sons inherit the ‘family name,’ and they inherit also ‘*a
share in the property*;’ and it has been already explained that this
‘share’ consists of *mere subsistence*. But the case of the ‘adopted’
son stands on the same footing as that of the ‘soil-born’ one. In
support of this view people quote other *Smṛti-texts*.

‘*According to their order*.’— The ‘body-born’ and the ‘soil-born’ sons
are entitled to inherit simultaneously; but among the rest, the
succeeding one inherits only in the absence of the preceding one.

“If only six of the sons are ‘heirs,’ and the other six are *not*
heirs,—according to the distinction into ‘heirs’ and ‘non-heirs’ made
(in 158), it cannot be right to declare all these to be *inheritors* of
property.”

As a matter of fact, those that have been described as ‘non-heirs’ are
so only in the presence of the ‘body-born’ son; all that is meant by the
distinction is that the first six are larger beneficiaries than the
second six.

Among the first group, all except the ‘body-born’ are equal
beneficiaries, and less than these latter are the six in the second
group; these latter are all equal, and there is no difference among
themselves, due to these being mentioned earlier or latter.—(165)

‘*Gotrarikthāṃśabhāginaḥ*.’—‘Become members of the *gotra* and also
inherit’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nandana);—‘share the family estate’
(Nārāyaṇa);—‘they receive such share in the estate as will suffice for
their maintenance’ (suggested by Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 544), which adds the
following notes:—The first half of the verse is merely a reiteration of
what has been prescribed before; the ‘ten’, beginning with the ‘adopted’
son, in due order, *i*.*e*., each in the absence of the one
preceding,—become ‘*gotrabhāginaḥ*,’—*i.e*., ‘entitled to do all that
behoves a blood-relation’, as explained by Asahāyācārya,—and
‘*rikthāṃśabhāginaḥ*’, *i.e*., ‘entitled to inherit the father’s
property This rule refers to cases where there is no ‘body-born’ son,
nor ‘the appointed daughter’, nor the ‘*Kṣetraja*’ son;—in *Dāyatattva*
(p. 14);—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 55 and 652).

*Gautama* (28.34)—‘The son of an unmarried damsel, the son of the
pregnant bride, the son of the remarried woman, the son of the appointed
daughter, the self-given son, and the bought son receive a fourth of the
estate, if there is no body-born son, or no one of the first six kinds
of son.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.132).—‘Among the twelve kinds of sons, the succeeding
one is entitled to offer the Ball and to inherit property only in the
absence of the preceding one.’

*Baudhāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 550).—‘The following sons are said to
he partakers of inheritance; the body-born son, the son of the appointed
daughter, the son begotten on one’s wife by another man, the adopted
son, the appointed son, the secretly-born son, and the cast-off son. The
following are partakers of the *gotra* only—the son born of the unborn
damsel, the son born of the pregnant bride, the son bought, the son of
the remarried woman, the self-given son and the son of the Śūdra
mother.’
