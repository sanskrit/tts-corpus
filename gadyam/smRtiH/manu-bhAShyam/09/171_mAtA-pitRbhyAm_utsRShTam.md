A child may be deserted by the parents, either because they have many
children whom they are unable to support by reason of poverty, or
because the particular child has some such defect as disaffection
towards his parents and the like.

But the child should not have been openly deserted; as in that case it
would not be entitled to being received as a son,—as has been shown
elsewhere.

This desertion may be by either one of the parents.

‘*Takes up*’—with a view to making him his son,—and not to only
supporting him.—(171)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 739), which explains the meaning
to be that the ‘*Apaviddha*’ son is one who is taken up on being
abandoned by the parents for some cause, other than his having become an
‘outcast—and in the *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 571), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Utsṛṣṭam*’, abandoned,—for some such reason as extreme poverty
and consequent incapability to maintain him, or the presence of some
defect in him; the acceptance also by the receiver should be for the
definite purpose of making him his son;—also in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 38);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 547 and 557);—and
in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 38a).
