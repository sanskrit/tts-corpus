‘*Defrauding*’ consists in cheating them out of their share in the
property, as also that of the honours etc., that may be conferred by the
king.

‘*Loses his seniority*’;—*i.e*., is to be treated as an ordinary kinsmen
(as laid down in 110). This does not preclude all that is due to him as
the eldest brother.

He loses also his ‘*share*’—*i.e*., the ‘preferential share’ due to him
as the eldest brother.

‘*Punished*.’—As the special form of punishment to be inflicted has not
been specified, he shall be reprimanded or censured or fined, in
accordance with the exact nature of his offence.—(213)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣāra* (2. 126) as having been understood
by some people to mean that ‘misappropriation’ of the entire property is
wrong only for the eldest brother, and not for the younger brothers.
This view, it says, is wrong; the verse clearly implying that, just as
it is wrong for the eldest brother who is in the place of father for the
younger brother to misappropriate the property, so it is also for the
younger brothers, who are as ‘sons’ to the eldest brother.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 383), which takes it to
mean that when even the eldest brother, who is independent, is held to
commit a wrong if he does the mis-appropriation, it is all the more
culpable in the case of the younger brothers, who are not independent.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 478), which explains
‘*vinikurvīta*’ as ‘should defraud,’ and ‘*ajyeṣṭhaḥ*’ as ‘not to be
respected as the eldest brother’;—and in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 58),
which remarks that the term ‘*jyeṣṭhaḥ*’ stands for all the heirs to a
property, the meaning being that when the eldest also is held culpable,
how much more so the younger brothers?
