The doubt having been set forth, the author puts forward the
‘preponderance of the seed’ as the *prima facie* argument And if the
seed is the superior factor, then the child must belong to him whose the
seed is. That the seed is the more important is indicated by the fact
that in the case of the corn and such other things, though the soil and
several other causes operate in their production, yet they take up the
characteristics of the seed. So that even though in the case of the
child, the transmission of the characteristics of the seed is not. so
clearly manifest, yet it has to be accepted as a fact, on the basis of
the fact of such transmission being found in the case of corn and other
things. Further, it is only when this view that is accepted that the
uniformity of all products becomes established. Thus it is that
superiority belongs to the seed.

This is what is shown by the text—‘*the production of all things*’ is
found to be ‘*marked by the characteristics of the seed*’;—*these*
‘*characteristics of the seed*’ consisting in shape, colour, figure and
so forth; and by this is the production ‘*marked*’ distinguished;
*i.e*., it follows them.—(35)
