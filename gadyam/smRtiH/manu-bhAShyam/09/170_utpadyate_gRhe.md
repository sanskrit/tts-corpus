If the mother were not known, then the caste also of the child would not
be known; as it has been declared by the ancients that ‘the caste of the
child whose progenitor is not known can be ascertained from his mother.’

The rule here laid down refers to a case where there is no suspicion
regarding the progenitor being of a lower caste. In the evenṭ. of such
suspicion, there would be likelihood of an ‘admixture in the reverse
order’; and in that case, the son would not be entitled to perform the
functions of a ‘son.’—(170)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 566);—which adds the
following notes:—‘*Talpaja*’, born of the wife;—the actual progenitor of
this child being unknown, it belongs to the same caste as its mother;
this is the case when there is no suspicion of the mother having had
intercourse with a man of a lower caste; in the case of there being such
suspicion, the child must he regarded as ‘born in the reverse order’,
and hence not capable of serving any useful purpose.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 38);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 541 and 557);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Vyavahāra 38a) and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 187b.)
