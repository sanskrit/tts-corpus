“As this verse and the following one contradict the rules given in
verses 123-124, the commentators try to reconcile them in various ways.
Medhātithi thinks that verses 123-124 are an *Arthavāda*, and have no
legal force, and Rāghavānanda inclines to the same opinion.—Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana hold that the seniority according to the mother’s marriage is of
importance for the law of inheritance (verses 123-124), but that it has
no value with respect to salutations and the like, or to prerogatives at
sacrifices (verses 125-126). Kullūka, finally relying on Govindarāja’s
opinion, thinks that the rules leave an option, and that their
application depends on the existence of good qualities and the want of
such. It is, however, probable that according to the custom of Hindu
writers, the two conflicting opinions are placed side by side, and that
it is intended that the learned should find their way out of the
difficulty as they can.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 36);—in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 177);—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 461).
