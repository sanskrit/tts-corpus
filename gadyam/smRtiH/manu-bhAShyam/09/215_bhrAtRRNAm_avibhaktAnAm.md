It has been said (*yājñavalkya*, 2.116) that—‘an unequal division has
been declared to be legal, if made by the father’;—it is this that is
denied here.

‘*Joint concern*,’—*i.e*., when all of them together earn something—one
by agriculture, another by receiving gifts, another by service, while
another takes care of what is earned by others, and invests them and
uses them to the advantage of all;—all this shall be brought together
and divided equally; and no excessive share shall be given to any one by
the father, through his love for him.—(215)

‘*Saha utthānam*.’—‘Joint acquisition—one earning by agriculture,
another by receiving gifts, another by service, another taking care of
what others bring in and so forth’ (Medhātithi);—‘joint concern,—such as
joint trading and so forth’ (Nārāyaṇa).—Explained by Jīmūtavāhana
(*Dāyabhāga*, 2.86) as ‘*effort* i.e., desire to have a division’
(Hopkins).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 468), which explains
‘*utthānam*’ as ‘action tending to the acquisition of wealth—in
*Aparārka* (p. 719 and p. 727) as an exception to the general that the
father may make an unequal division;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta,
p. 129), which says that this refers to cases where the property has
been acquired by the equal efforts of all the brothers, and hence it
does not conflict with the text which lays down that the brothers are to
accept without demur even an unequal partition among them by their
father, of the property *acquired by him*.

*Mahābhārata* (13.105.12).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (2.120).—‘When a property has been acquired by several
brothers in common, it shall be shared equally by all. Among sons of the
several brothers, the shares shall be apportioned in accordance with
what would have been the share of their respective fathers.’

*Bṛhaspati* (25.14, Aparārka, p. 727).—‘What has been acquired by
several brothers living together,—in that property all are equal
sharers; if each of them has an equal and unequal number of sons, these
latter shall take the shares of their respective fathers.’

215	If undivided brethren, (living with their father,) together make an exertion (for gain), the father shall on no account give to them unequal shares (on a division of the estate).
