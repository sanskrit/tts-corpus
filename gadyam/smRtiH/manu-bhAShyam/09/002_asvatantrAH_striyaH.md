Women should not be left free to act as they like, in regard to
morality, wealth and pleasure. Whenever they desire to employ their
wealth in acts of righteousness and the like, they should obtain the
permission of their ‘*men*’, the husband or other male relations,
according to her age.

‘*Their men*’—Guardians, indicated in the following verse.

‘*Sensual objects*’—Singing and the like; they become ‘*addicted to*’
having recourse to—these,—‘*they should be kept under one’s
control*,’—should be cheeked.

Though the phrase ‘*not left to themselves*’ indicates the propriety of
depriving them of independence in regard to all actions, yet the text
specifically mentions the ‘sensual objects’ with a view to point out
that in regard to latter special care should be taken; so that people
may not be led to think that all that is necessary is to prevent the
women from associating with other men, and it does not matter if they
become addicted to drink and other evils, while keeping confined to
their homes.

The particle ‘*ca*’ indicates that, though what the words directly
declare is the duty of the man, yet it also follows that the woman also
should not be independent; it is in this manner that the duties of both
‘man and woman’ in relation to one another become expounded, as promised
in verse (1),—and not those duties that consist of sacrificial
performances and the like.—(2).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.195), which adds the following
notes:—As a matter of fact, this appearing of husband and wife before
the king as plaintiff and defendant is forbidden, and as such there is
no room for this subject under the present head; but what is meant is
that if, from other sources, the king should happen to hear of the
misbehaviour of the one or the other of the party, he should interfere,
and by means of judicious punishment bring them back to the path of
righteousness; otherwise he becomes involved in sin.—*Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following explanatory notes:—‘*Svaiḥ*’, the women’s own brother and
other relations,—‘*divāniśam*,’ always,—‘*viṣayesu*’, even such objects
of enjoyment as are not actually forbidden, such as beautiful things,
tasty food, and so forth,—‘*sajjantyaḥ*’ addicted,—they should be kept
under control.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 322); in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 330), which adds that ‘though a regular law-suit
between husband and wife has been prohibited, yet if the king happens to
learn from other sources, of quarrels between them, he should intervene
and make them keep to the right path,’—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 98)
which explains ‘*sajjantyaḥ*’ as becoming ‘addicted’—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 31b).

them.\]]

*Gautama* (18.1).—‘A wife is not independent with respect to the sacred
Law.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.44).—‘Women do not possess independence.’

*Vaśiṣṭha*( 5.1).—‘A woman is not independent; the males are her
masters.’

*Viṣṇu* (25.12).—‘Not to act by herself in any matter.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.85).—‘There is no independence for woman at any time.’

*Bṛhaspati* (24.2).—‘A woman must be restrained from even slight
transgressions by her relations,—by night and by day she must be watched
by her mother-in-law and other ladies of the family.

*Śukranīti* (4.4.11, 23).—‘Women have no separate right to the
employment of the means of realising the three ends of spiritual merit,
wealth and pleasure. The wife should be pure in mind, speech and action;
she should abide by the instructions of her husband, and follow him like
his shadow, and be a friend in all his activities and servant in all his
commands.’
