But if a son happen to be born after the daughter has been ‘appointed,’ the division must be equal; as there is no seniority for the woman.—(134)

**समस् तत्र** तुल्यो विभागो जातेन पुत्रेण ज्येष्ठांशनिषेधः । **ज्येष्ठता नास्ति हि स्त्रियाः** रिक्थभाग एव ज्येष्ठता निषिध्यते न त्व् अस्यां गुरुवृत्तौ ॥ ९.१३४ ॥

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The division shall be equal,—there shall be equal shares, with the son
thus born.

This precludes the ‘preferential share.’

‘*There is no seniority for the woman*.’—The ‘seniority’ precluded is in
regard to the share of inheritance only, and not in regard to the
treatment to be accorded to her.—(134)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 541), which adds the
following notes:—The ‘*putra*’ here stands for the *aurasa*,
‘body-born,’ son;—‘*anu*’, after the ‘appointment’ of the
daughter;—‘*striyāḥ*’, of the ‘appointed daughter’; who the ‘appointed
daughter’ is, is described by Manu in verse 127.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.132) to the effect that when both the
sons—the body-born son and the son born of the ‘appointed daughter’—are
there, all the property is *not* to go to the former only. The
*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds that the meaning of the last quarter is that the
‘special portion’ ordained for the ‘eldest son’ does not accrue to the
‘appointed daughter’ or her son.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 739);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p.
347), which has the same note as the *Mitākṣarā*;—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 654);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 150);—in
*Dāyakramasaṅgraha* (p. 51);—by Jīmūtavāhan (*Dāyabhāga*, pp. 223 and
67), as setting forth a reason why the Appointed Daughter should offer
the Ball through her son.

*Bṛhaspati* (25.33, 35).—‘Of the thirteen sons mentioned by Manu, the
Body-horn son and the Appointed Daughter continue the family. No one hut
a Body-born son is declared to be the father’s heir; an Appointed
Daughter is equal to him; all the others are entitled to maintenance
only.’

*Kātyāyana* (Parāśaramādhava-Vyavahāra, p. 347).—‘On the birth of a
Body-born son, the other sons are entitled to only a fourth part of the
share, if they belong to the same caste as the father; if they belong to
lower castes, they are entitled to food and clothing only.’

134	But if, after a daughter has been appointed, a son be born (to her father), the division (of the inheritance) must in that (case) be equal; for there is no right of primogeniture for a woman.
