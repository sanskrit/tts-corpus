The son is as one’s own self, and the daughter is equal to the son; hence so long as she is there in her own real character, how can anyone else take his property?—(130)

It has been said that the father shall declare—‘The child that is born
of her shall be mine;’ and a man’? child inherits his property; so that
at the time that the father dies, if the daughter has got no child, it
would seem that she cannot inherit his property; it is in view of this
that the present text lays down that she shall inherit it

‘*So long as she is there in her own real character*’—of being meant to
provide a son.

Or, it. may mean—‘while the father’s own self is there, in the shape of
the daughter.’

‘*The daughter is equal to the son*.’—Though the text uses the generic
term ‘daughter,’ yet from the context it is clear that it is the
‘appointed daughter’ that is clearly meant.—(130)

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 591);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(Calcutta, p. 152), to the effect that like the son, the daughter also
serves the purpose of propagating the father’s race;—in *Hāralatā* (p.
179);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 663 and 691);—in *Vīramitrodaya*

*Mahābhārata* (13.45-11).—(Same as Manu.)

*Baudhāyana* (2.3-14).—‘One must know a son begotten by the husband
himself on a wedded wife of equal caste to be a legitimate son of the
body. They quote the following: “From the several limbs of my body art
thou produced, from my heart art thou born; thou art my very *self*
called a son; mayst thou live a hundred years.’

130	A son is even (as) oneself, (such) a daughter is equal to a son; how can another (heir) take the estate, while such (an appointed daughter who is even) oneself, lives?
