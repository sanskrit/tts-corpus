The wife has to be protected, not only because the scriptures prescribe
it as a duty; but also because it serves many useful purposes, such as
the following.

‘*Offspring*’—Progeny, in the shape of sons and daughters. The
‘preservation’ of this means that one’s progeny is kept pure, free from
the amalgam of castes. ‘*Character*’—cultured habits.

‘*Family*’—described above. If a single woman of a family loses her
chastity, the ill-fame attaches to the whole family, the idea among the
people being that ‘the women of such and such a family are not chaste’.

Or, the meaning may be that the said guarding is necessary in view of
the fact that, if the purity of the progeny were not secured, there
would be no proper fulfilment of the after-death rites performed in
honour of one’s ancestors.

‘*His own self*’.—It is well known that men are often murdered by their
wife’s paramours, or poisoned by their wives.

‘*His religion*’—An unchaste woman not being entitled to being
associated in the performance of religious rites.

For these reasons, if a man guards his wife, he preserves all these—(7).

‘*Kulam*’—‘Ancestors who can obtain offerings only from legitimate
descendants’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘relatives, who are
dishonoured by ladies of the family misbehaving’ (Medhātithi,
alternatively, and Rāghavā nanda);—‘position of the family’
(Nārāyaṇa);—‘property’ (Rāghavānanda).

‘*Ātmānam*’—‘Himself,’ ‘as only legitimate children can offer
*Śrāddhas*’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘because an
adultress and her paramour may attempt his life’ (Medhātithi).

‘*Dharmam*’—‘Tending of the sacred fires, to which the husband of an
adultress is not entitled’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘the
duties of the Householder’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 411);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 323);—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 987);—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 32a).
