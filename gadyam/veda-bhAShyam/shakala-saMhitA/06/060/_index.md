Indra and Agni  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
15 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, gāyatrī 4–12, triṣṭubh 13, br̥hatī 14, anuṣṭubh 15, arranged  in trcas ̥  
This Indra-Agni hymn, organized into tr̥cas, begins with three verses in trimeter  meter notable for the tendency to address Indra and Agni separately, each in the  vocative singular, though they receive joint epithets, are referred to by shared pro nouns, and are generally, but not exclusively (see vs. 2d), the subjects of dual verbs.  Our translation reflects this peculiar disjunction of vocatives. This separate address  is not characteristic of the rest of the hymn, where the dual dvandva compound  “Indra-Agni” (or, once, a conjoined phrase “Indra and Agni,” vs. 12) is found in  nine of the remaining twelve verses, and the last tr̥ca begins with a verse (13) con  
taining four occurrences of the explicit adjective “(you) both” (ubhā́). The content of the praise is generic, with a tendency toward Indraic deeds and  qualities (see esp. vss. 3, 6). The second-to-last tr̥ca treats the two gods separately,  without naming them: Agni in verse 10, Indra in verse 11, and a return to joint ref erence in verse 12. The final triplet (vss. 13–15) is in three different meters, and it has  been suggested that it did not originally belong to the rest of the hymn. However,  notice that the return to longer lines matches the meter of the first tr̥ca, and there  are also verbal responsions with the first three verses, so that a ring-compositional  structure is sketched. The strong emphasis on the unified front presented by the two  gods in verses 13–15 contrasts implicitly with the separate address in the first tr̥ca,  and may hint that our own hymn has brought about the close cooperation between  the two gods that will benefit us.
