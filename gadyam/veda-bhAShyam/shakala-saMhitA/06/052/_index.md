R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja  
17 verses: triṣṭubh 1–6, gāyatrī 7–12, triṣṭubh 13, jagatī 14, triṣṭubh 15–17, generally  arranged in trcas ̥  
This final, seventeen-verse hymn of the short All God cycle of Maṇḍala VI is met rically and thematically non-unified, and probably consists of originally separate  pieces later joined together. (So also Oldenberg 1888:  199–200.) The first twelve  verses divide into four tr̥cas, the first two in one meter, the second two in another.  The first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) inveighs against a rival sacrificer and calls on the Maruts  and Soma to destroy him, in lively and imaginative terms. In style, though not in  meter, it more closely resembles verses 13–15 of the preceding hymn VI.51 than  what follows. The second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) is more staid, but notable for calling on not  only the standard deities but also on natural phenomena for aid. The remainder of  the hymn is generic and somewhat repetitive, urging the gods in general to hear our  calls and partake of our sacrifice. Relatively few gods are mentioned by name; there  

is instead an effort to include all the gods, whatever their current or original loca tion (see esp. vss. 13, 15). After the first two tr̥cas, the language is for the most part  easy and without much character.
