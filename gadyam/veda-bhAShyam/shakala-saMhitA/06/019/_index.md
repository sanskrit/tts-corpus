‘ महाँ इन्द्रः' इति त्रयोदशर्चं चतुर्थं सूक्तं भरद्वाजस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभमैन्द्रम् । अनुक्रान्तं च--- 'महान्त्सप्तोना' इति । माध्यंदिने सवने सोमातिरेके शस्त्रं भवति । तत्रेदं सूक्तम् । सूत्रितं च - महाँ इन्द्रो नृवद्विष्णोर्नु कम्' ( आश्व, श्रौ. ६. ७ ) इति । समूळ्हे द्वितीये छन्दोमे मरुस्वतीयशस्त्र एतत्सूक्तम् । सूत्रितं च - महाँ इन्द्रो नृवदिति मरुत्वतीयम्' (आश्व. श्रौ. ८. ७) इति ।

Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
13 verses: triṣṭubh  
Like the previous hymn, this one exults in the mighty powers of Indra and in the  rich lexicon that describes them, although it is perhaps somewhat less insistent (but  see vs. 6ab). Also as in VI.18 the poet exhorts Indra to put his powers to good use  for the men associated with the poet. The three middle verses (6–8) all contain the  phrase “bring here to us,” each with a different abstract power as object, and the  remaining verses continue these requests for aid and support, especially in defeating  enemies and rivals.

Indra This hymn is something of a bricolage, with numerous phrases, pādas, and whole verses borrowed from elsewhere. (I say “borrowed” rather than the more neutral “parallel to,” because the sheer number of the matches strongly suggests that there is a magpie quality to the construction of this hymn. For details of the matches, see Geldner’s nn. (though he doesn’t note all of them) and Bloomfield Rig-Veda Repetitions
