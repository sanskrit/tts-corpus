‘य ओजिष्ठः' इति पञ्चर्चं दशमं सूक्तं शुनहोत्रस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभमैन्द्रम्! अनुक्रम्यते च–'य ओजिष्ठः शुनहोत्रस्तु' इति । महाव्रतेऽपि निष्केवल्य उक्तो विनियोगः ।।

Indra  
Śunahotra Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
A martial hymn. The poet reminds Indra that he will receive entreaties for help  from all sides in the combat (vs. 2, using language almost identical to that in nearby  VI.31.1), but begs him to help our side alone, in battles and in contests. The poetry  is for the most part quite straightforward, except for the enigmatic expression in  verse 3 (probably not coincidentally the middle verse), in which Indra’s weapons  against formidable enemies appear to be “well-placed cloaks.” This expression has  been much discussed, and a number of scholars have opted to emend it. But it  likely refers to Indra’s penchant for shape-shifting disguises in combat. Moreover,  the word “well-placed” (súdhita) is phonologically close to a word for “hatchet”  (svádhiti), and this pun may well be lurking in the simile about trees.
