Indra  
Śaṃyu Bārhaspatya  
24 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–6, triṣṭubh or virāj 7, 9, virāj 8, triṣṭubh 10–24, arranged in trcas ̥  
A composite hymn placed toward the end of the Indra cycle in Maṇḍala VI, the  hymn consists of eight tr̥cas, the first two (vss. 1–6) in anuṣṭubh, the third (vss. 7–9)  in a mixture of triṣṭubh and virāj, and the remaining five (vss. 10–24) in triṣṭubh.  Several of the tr̥cas are rhetorically unified: 1–3 with its repeated second half-verse  following a definitional relative clause; 19–21 with its insistent “bull” theme; 22–24  with its repeated half-verse-initial “this one here” (ayám) referring to soma. The  others have less obvious internal unity, though there is often a continuity of theme  or subject. There is also no visible external unity among the tr̥cas collected in this  “hymn,” though it seldom strays far from Indra and the soma-drinking, the topic of  many of the immediately preceding hymns. Indeed, Oldenberg (1888: 203) suggests  that VI.44 owes its position to the similarity between the refrain of its first tr̥ca and  the refrain of VI.43.
