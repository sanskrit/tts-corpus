Agni  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
An unremarkable hymn. It begins “I call for you (all)”—the poet announcing that  he is performing his ritual task for his priestly colleagues. He continues with praise  of Agni and description of his roles, including that of giver of goods (vss. 1–3). The  next two verses contrast the enemy of the mortals present and the punishment he  should receive from Agni (vs. 4) with the pious server and the rewards he deserves  (vs. 5). Two more verses (6–7) urge Agni to perform these tasks.
