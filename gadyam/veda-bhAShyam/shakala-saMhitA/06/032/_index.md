‘ अपूर्व्या' इति पञ्चर्चं नवमं सूक्तं त्रैष्टुभमैन्द्रम् । ‘अपूर्व्या' इत्यनुक्रान्तम् । द्वितीये छान्दोमिकेऽहनि निष्केवल्य एतत्सूक्तम् । सूत्रितं च--- अपूर्व्या पुरुतमानि तां सु ते कीर्तिम् ' (आश्व. श्रौ. ८.७ ) इति । महाव्रतेऽपि निष्केवल्येऽस्य सूक्तस्य विनियोग उक्तः ॥

Indra  
Suhotra Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Unlike the common practice, whereby the final verse of the hymn constitutes the  poet’s summing up of his hymn, in this hymn the first verse serves this purpose, in  meta-relationship with what follows. The remaining verses, each of which begins  with the pronoun sá “he,” constitute the praise the poet announced in verse 1. Verses  2–3 refer to the Vala myth, with special attention paid to Indra’s companions in this  enterprise, the unnamed Aṅgirases, and verse 5 may be an oblique account of the  aftermath of the Vr̥tra slaying. In verse 4 Indra is exhorted to grant the singer pow  
ers and riches.

Indra As noted in the published introduction, the first vs. is a meta-verse in which the poet refers to his own just-composed praise; the remaining vss. constitute that praise, and all begin with the prn. sá, a stylistic repetition that unifies and defines the praisehymn proper. It is noteworthy that, although the vocabulary and rhetoric leave no doubt of the identity of the recipient of the praise, the name “Indra” is not mentioned until the last vs. (5b) and the word “god” not at all. In this connection note the unaccented dat. asmai ‘for him’ in the first pāda of the hymn. Such unaccented oblique pronominal forms assume a referent already in the discourse, so Indra is present from the beginning despite not being named or even referred to at this point in the hymn, and the dative descriptors that follow in this vs., particularly vajríṇe ‘possessing the mace’ in c, simply reinforce the audience’s recognition.
