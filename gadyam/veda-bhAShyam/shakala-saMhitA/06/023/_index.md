Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn focuses on Indra’s vital connection with soma and on the reciprocal  relationship between the soma-presser and Indra, the soma-drinker. This theme is  established in the first pāda of the first verse, and every subsequent verse has some  reference to soma: all but verse 8 contain a form of the word sóma (and vs. 8 does  make clear reference to soma-induced exhilaration), and of those, all but verse 7  have “pressed,” “pressing,” or “presser” as well. The other ritual aspects of the soma  sacrifice, especially the poetry and sacred formulations, also receive frequent men  
tion. The reminders to Indra that sacrificial labor should be requited with gifts and  help from the god occur throughout the hymn, but are not annoyingly obtrusive. Stylistically the hymn is noteworthy for its pairs of syntactically linked verses: 1–2  with their “or when” clauses; 3–4 with their run of agent nouns governing accusa tive objects; 5–6 with a number of repeated formulae.
