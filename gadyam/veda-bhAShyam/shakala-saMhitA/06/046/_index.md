Indra  
Śaṃyu Bārhaspatya  
14 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas  
Like the previous two hymns, this one has too many verses for its position in the  Indra cycle, though its division into the two-verse pragātha units may account for  its placement. Nonetheless, the hymn seems to be a conceptual unity, rather than a  collection of independent pragāthas.  
The hymn concentrates on Indra as the helper of his praisers in contests and in  battles. He is exhorted to come to our aid, to provide us with protection, to bring  

us the power inhering in rival peoples (see especially vss. 7–8), and to help us defeat  our foes. The hymn is without major complications, and the theme is more repeated  than developed. This regular repetition gives the hymn an unhurried pace, which  contrasts with the urgency of the contests and battles described. This pace begins  to quicken in the last verses: the repeated phrase introducing an imperative, “So  then, as ever” (vss. 10, 11, 12), seems to be building to a finale. But the last pragātha  (vss. 13–14), rather than providing the expected climactic plea to Indra for aid that  would end the hymn conventionally, is instead a two-verse subordinate clause about  Indra and his racing horses that utterly lacks a main clause, and it displays a den sity of imagery, with unrelated similes piled up pell-mell, that seems designed to  replicate the breathless pace of a real contest—a remarkable effect. At the same  time, it harkens back to the beginning of the hymn, with its mention of steeds and  the racecourse (see vs. 1) and the “great stakes” (see vs. 4), so that the apparently  reckless speed and lack of completion of the final two verses is contained within a  ring-compositional structure.

Indra This hymn nicely demonstrates the distribution of impv. forms to √bhū that I discussed in my 1997 “Syntactic constraints on morphological change: The Vedic imperatives bodhi, dehi, and dhehi”: bháva/bhava is found initial (3d) or final (10d, 11a) in its pāda or clause, while bodhi is internal (4c).
