Indra and Soma  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Each verse in this brief hymn begins with a vocative addressing the two recipients  of the hymn, joined in a dual dvandva compound. Each of the verses recounts  one or more of Indra’s cosmogonic deeds or his beneficial acts for mankind,  here ascribed equally to both gods. Since Indra needs to drink soma in order to  accomplish his feats, this sharing of credit is not surprising. Some of the acts are  expressed in the past tense, some in the present, even those that belong to the  mythical past like the smashing of the serpent (vs. 3). The language is straight  
forward, even in the expression of the familiar paradox in verse 4 of the cooked  milk found in the raw cows.
