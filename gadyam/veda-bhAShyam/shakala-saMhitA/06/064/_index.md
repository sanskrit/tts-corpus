Dawn  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn begins with reference to multiple Dawns, but soon (by the second half of  vs. 1) focuses only on a single Dawn. As so often, the hymn refers to the present and  immediate past when Dawn has just dawned. The standard tropes are present: her  wide radiance (vss. 2, 3), her ease of travel (vss. 1, 4), her feminine beauty (vs. 2),  her accompanying bovines (vss. 3, 5), and especially her connection with the priestly  gift distributed at the early-morning sacrifice and with wealth in general (vss. 1, 4,  5, 6). Although the hymn does not stand out for elaborate rhetorical tricks, it is  characterized by pleasing imagery; see especially Dawn as archer and chariot-driver  in verse 3 and the morning activities of birds and men in verse 6 (a verse found also  at I.124.12).
