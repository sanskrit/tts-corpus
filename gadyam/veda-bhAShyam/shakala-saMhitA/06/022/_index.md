22 (463)  
Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
Like the previous hymn, this one compares the current poet to previous genera tions of poets (see vss. 2, 4, 7) and asks Indra directly what in the sacrifice might  please him (vs. 4 [cf. VI.21.4]). In fact, the same phrase is used in both hymns to  introduce other questions: VI.21.6 tám pr̥chántaḥ “(the singers) asking about him”  and VI.22.5 tám pr̥chántī “(the song) asking about him.” In each case the subject  (singers or song) seeks information about ways to make contact and find favor with  Indra, though the anxiety seems less in this hymn than in VI.21.  
The similarities between VI.21 and 22 extend to their final verses. The exhor tation to come here with his teams in VI.22.11 is structurally and semantically,  though not lexically, parallel to two halves of the two final verses of VI.21, 11ab  and 12cd—an interesting example of how a poet can expand an underlying formu laic sequence by inserting new material.  
Otherwise, the hymn alternates verses praising Indra’s qualities and deeds in  list-like fashion (e.g., vss. 1cd, 2cd) and begging him for wealth and martial help  (e.g., vss. 3, 8, 10). Stylistically it is noteworthy that in much of the hymn, particu larly at the beginning, the initial word of every half-verse refers to Indra (1a, c; 2a,  c; 3a; 5a, c; 7a, c; 11a). In 3c, the first half-verse in the hymn not beginning with a  word referring to Indra, the poet tricks us by playing on our expectations: the yáḥ “who” could easily be Indra, as it was earlier (see 1a, c), but in fact has a different  referent. The most complex verse syntactically is verse 5, which is perhaps fitting, as  it describes the poet’s own song.
