Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn traces a satisfying arc from beginning to end: the trajectory is not pre dictable, but the progress from a large and open question to extreme specificity is  neatly handled. It begins with a question, a question all the more open because one  of the crucial terms is unspecified (though easily supplied), the repeated pronoun  asya “of it”—referring, clearly, to soma. The question is what did Indra make or  create under the influence “of it,” and the surprisingly broad answer given in the  responsive verse 2 is “what exists.”  
The unqualified comprehensiveness of Indra’ production—“being,” “what  exists”—is contrasted with our imperfect knowledge of his powers in verse 3. But  even what small proportion of that power we have experienced (vs. 4) was more  than sufficient to destroy the Vr̥cīvant army of the enemy Varaśikha for the benefit  of the poet’s patron, Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna—a battle described in verses 4–7. The  second half of verse 6 is especially notable for its warrior slang: the phrase “playing  the lord’s role for an arrow,” which also appears in X.27.6, in our opinion refers to  warriors’ boasting, and “breaking their pots,” which many commentators have tried  to interpret literally, must show the same use of “pot” for “head” as, for example,  German “Kopf” and French “tête.” In our opinion the site of the battle is the con fluence of two rivers, mentioned by name in verses 5 and 6, and then referred to  jointly in verse 7. The dual bovines in that verse have been variously interpreted, but in our opinion, despite a problem with grammatical gender, the most likely referents  are the rivers, in a phrase very reminiscent of one (III.33.1) describing two rivers as  mother cows licking each other in the famous hymn III.33, the dialogue between  the poet Viśvāmitra and two rivers.  
The final verse is a dānastuti, praising and detailing the gift made by Abhyāvartin  Cāyamāna to the poet. The poet gives his patron the epithets “bounteous,” a stan dard qualification of Indra (as in vs. 3 in this very hymn), and “universal king,” also  regularly used of Indra (among other divinities). He thus verbally associates his  patron with the unlimited power of Indra, as it was portrayed earlier in the hymn.
