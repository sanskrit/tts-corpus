Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
15 verses: triṣṭubh  
The poet of this hymn seems to be aiming to deploy as many different words for  power, might, strength, and so forth in as many different derivational forms as pos sible. The sheer power of Indra, thus expressed, overshadows his particular deeds,  which are mentioned in a somewhat cursory way: Vala (vs. 5), Vr̥tra (vs. 6, also 9  and 14), the destruction of various named monsters (vs. 8). The poet is also fond  of figures involving a positive and a twist on its negation: “vanquishing but unvan quished” (vs. 1), and so forth.  
This focus on Indra’s power betrays some nervous worry about the existence  of that power, expressed especially in the rhetorical question and answer in verses  3–4. A number of hymns in the R̥gveda raise the question of whether Indra himself exists; here the existential anxiety has been displaced to an abstract entity, his might,  but the poet asserts its existence so often and so unequivocally that his audience can  scarcely doubt it. Needless to say, the recital of Indra’s strength is not disinter ested: the poet calls for Indra to use his powers in defense of the poet’s people and,  in the last verse (15), to perform the deed that exists for him to do (a nice return to  the existential theme), in order to merit another poem from the poet.
