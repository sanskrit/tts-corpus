Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
The clear purpose of this hymn is to solicit Indra’s aid against enemies in battle. The  various types of opponents are vividly described, as well as the potential types of  hostile encounter: see especially the apparent wrestling match in 4ab. But the poet’s  expressed confidence in Indra’s ability to provide the decisive assistance is also a  subtle way of asserting the supremacy of Indra. This second theme can be seen  

more clearly by examining the structure of the hymn: verse 5, which concerns the  invincibility of Indra, is the exact middle of the hymn and serves as an omphalos;  verses 4 and 6 match each other in structure and referents and form a ring around  the omphalos, with a further ring provided by repeated phrases in verses 1/2 and  8/9, with Indra’s supremacy repeated in verse 8.
