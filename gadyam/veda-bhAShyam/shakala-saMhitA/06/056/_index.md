Pūsaṇ  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
6 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 6  
This hymn has several elements familiar from the previous Pūṣan hymns: he is “the  best charioteer” (vs. 2, cf. VI.55.2); he helps the thoughts of poets reach their goal  (vs. 4, cf. VI.53.4); he helps us win the prize of cattle (vs. 5, cf. VI.53.4, 10).  
There are several novelties in the hymn as well. The hymn begins by naming  Pūṣan as “porridge-eater” in an enigmatic construction. Porridge is indeed well  known from elsewhere as Pūṣan’s characteristic food (see, e.g., VI.57.2 in the next  hymn), but is the last phrase of verse 1 an ominous warning, as some have taken it  (Pūṣan will be insulted), or a positive indication of Pūṣan’s eagerness to respond, as  others have (he doesn’t need to be invited twice, when porridge is mentioned)? We  think that it is neither one; rather, “porridge eater” is such a unique designation for  Pūṣan that a poet need provide no further clues to identify him.  
In verse 2 Indra appears as Pūṣan’s companion; this partnership is further devel oped in the next hymn, VI.57. The third verse is the most puzzling of the hymn.  Nothing further is known about this story—if it is a story—of Pūṣan, the Sun’s char iot wheel, and the gray cow, though we suspect that it is connected with the extremely  puzzling nearby verse VI.48.17, also of Pūṣan. If so, this associates Pūṣan with Indra  in the tearing off of the wheel of the Sun’s chariot, a myth found in scattered pieces  elsewhere. The “gray cow” may also be a naturalistic reference to a cloudy dawn  twilight, with the sun rising through it. Whatever lies behind it, the image is striking.
