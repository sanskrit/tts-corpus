Pūsaṇ  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
10 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 8  
Pūṣan is a favorite minor god of the Bharadvājas: this short Pūṣan sequence (VI.53– 58) is the only series of hymns dedicated to Pūṣan in the R̥gveda. This particular  hymn begins with gentle and positive requests of the god (vss. 1–2), but quickly  becomes more bloodthirsty, seeking Pūṣan’s punishment against stingy patrons. The  instruments of punishment are the homely tools of Pūṣan, his awl (vss. 5–8) and goad  (vs. 9). Despite the apparent viciousness of the actions urged on Pūṣan, the short  lines, repeated phrases, colloquial expressions, and phonetic figures (what is trans  
lated anachronistically as “shred them, make them shrapnel” in vss. 7–8 is in Sanskrit  the delightful ā́ rikha kikirā́ kr̥ṇu) give a light texture and playful feeling to the hymn.

Pūṣan Although, as noted in the published introduction, this hymn is remarkably bloodthirsty, there is also a minor theme focusing on poetry and poetic formulation. The word dhī́- ‘poetic vision’ is found in the first and last vss., shaping a faint ring, as well as in vs. 4. And Pūṣan is called kaví- in vs. 5, and his awl is the ‘impeller of the bráhman-’ (brahma-códanī-) in vs. 8.
