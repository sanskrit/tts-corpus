Agni  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first two verses of this hymn promise success to the mortal who behaves prop erly and performs his sacrificial duties well. With these decorous sentiments out of  the way, the poet can indulge himself for the rest of the hymn (vss. 3–8) in a series  of compressed and vivid images of fire as a natural substance, involving both sight  (esp. vss. 3–5, 8) and sound (esp. vss. 6–7). The almost feverish succession of image  upon image and the contorted phraseology are reminiscent of the depictions of  natural fire in VI.2.6–9, but allowed even freer rein and more space. The hymn ends  abruptly, without the usual prayers for benefits or even a summary verse calling  attention to the praise just offered to Agni. It is a wild, exhilarating, and often baf  
fling ride, especially in the original Sanskrit.
