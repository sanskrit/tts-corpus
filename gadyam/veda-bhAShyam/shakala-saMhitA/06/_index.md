### Sages  
The VIth Maṇḍala, attributed to the Bharadvāja clan, contains seventy-five hymns.  The Anukramaṇī identifies the majority of the hymns as products of the eponymous clan poet himself, Bharadvāja, whose patronymic is Bārhaspatya. These  include all of the Agni series (1–16), much of the Indra series (17–30 and 37–43),  the Pūṣan series (53–60), and the miscellaneous hymns to various divinities toward  the end of the maṇḍala (61–74). 

The composite hymns coming at the end of the  Indra series (44–46, also 48) are ascribed to a different Bārhaspatya poet, Śaṃyu  Bārhaspatya, but since Śaṃyu is a speaking name (“seeking luck,” reinterpreted  from the archaic compound śaṃyóḥ “luck and lifetime”), this name may well be a  nickname of Bharadvāja. 

The remaining hymns are attributed to several different  descendants of Bharadvāja, all bearing the patronymic Bhāradvāja; these include a  number of Indra hymns (31–36, 47), the All God series (49–52), and the final hymn  of the maṇḍala, the famous weapon hymn (75).+++(5)+++

### Gods  
Although the Indra hymns outnumber the Agni hymns, the Indra hymns are,  for the most part, not terribly notable, though deftly executed. By contrast, the  Agni hymns specialize in imaginative descriptions of physical fire, and VI.9, a hymn  ostensibly dedicated to Agni Vaiśvānara, contains one of the most striking meditations on the acquisition and employment of poetic craft in the R̥gveda. 

The hymn  VI.28, interrupting the Indra cycle, contains a charming blessing of the cows, and  the “clan” hymn, VI.48, repays the attention its difficulties demand. This hymn  contains, inter alia+++(=antar anyeṣu)+++, a remarkable, if cryptic, address to the god Pūṣan, and Pūṣan  is an especial preoccupation of the Bharadvāja poets, with VI.53–60 containing the  only sustained cycle of hymns in the R̥gveda addressed to this minor deity. Other  gods, well represented in other maṇḍalas, receive relatively short shrift: there is only  a single hymn to the Maruts (66), two to Uṣas (64–65), and so on.
