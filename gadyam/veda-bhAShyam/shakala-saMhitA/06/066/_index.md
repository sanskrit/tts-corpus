Maruts  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
The only hymn to the Maruts in Maṇḍala VI, this poem is complex, playful, allu sive, and very difficult in parts.  
It begins with five dense and syntactically contorted verses about the birth of  the Maruts, a topic that regularly invites such treatment. The story of the birth is  introduced by a signal that it is esoteric knowledge; verse 1a announces it as a mar vel even for someone who really perceives properly. The rest of the verse is both a  paradox and a riddle: two entities have the same name, “milker,” but one of them  constantly gives milk, and the other has done so only once. The riddle is solved by  the last word of the verse, “udder”; the paradox juxtaposes the normal udder of  a cow, which constantly swells with milk, with the udder of the Marut’s mother,  Pr̥śni, who bore them, that is, milked them out, all at once. (This same phenom  
enon is referred to in riddling terms in VI.48.22.) Verse 2 continues this theme, and  the other parent of the Maruts, their father Rudra, is introduced in verse 3. But  both 1 and 3 also allude to the androgynous behavior of the mother Pr̥śni, who  elsewhere (see esp. IV.3.10) is identified as a bull who gives milk that is identical  with semen; in verse 3 here she is the subject of the quintessentially male verb of  impregnation (gárbhaṃ √dhā “implant an embryo”). Verse 4 is the most opaque  verse in this sequence. It clearly describes the moment of the Maruts’ birth; they  did not resist being born, but in fact were milked out when they wished, after hav ing “purified their flaws” while still within her womb. A two-word expression early  in the verse (áyā nú) seems to have a double meaning: on the one hand, it is the  poet’s comment about the manner of birth: “now (it happened) in this way”; on the other, it can be read as the direct speech of the Maruts (considered as a group),  “Now I will go” (that is, be born), an indication of their moment of choice. The  final verse of the birth story relates the fact that Pr̥śni, having given them as milk,  did not give them milk after they were born, but they were undeterred. There is  much that is doubtful in our translation of these verses, but the main outlines seem  clear, while the tricks of the poet are much on display.  
Though more of his tricks appear in the rest of the hymn, none of it is as dif ficult as these first five verses. Verse 6 turns on a pun between the word for the  “two world-halves” (ródasī) and the female who is often found as the Maruts’ lover,  Rodasī́ (distinguished from the first only by accent). The marvel of their journey  through the midspace is described in verse 7, and the good fortune of the man who  receives their aid in verse 8. The journey of verse 7 must be to carry them to our sac rifice, for the remaining verses bring the hymn to a fairly conventional end: in verse  9 we produce a hymn for the Maruts; in verse 10 they are compared to the ritual  fire, an appropriate simile if they are situated on the ritual ground; in the final verse  (10) the aim of attracting them to the sacrifice is made explicit and the competing  hymns of rival sacrificers are alluded to.  
Unlike many Marut hymns, this one lacks any significant description of their  thunderstorm-like aspects.
