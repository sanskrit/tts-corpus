तृतीयेऽनुवाके विंशतिसूक्तानि । तत्र ‘वृषा मदः' इति दशर्चं प्रथमं सूक्तं भरद्वाजस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभमैन्द्रम् । ‘वृषा' इत्यनुक्रान्तम् । विषुवति निष्केवल्य एतत्सूक्तम् । सूत्रितं च-- वृषा मदः प्र मंहिष्ठाय' (आश्व. श्रौ. ८. ६ ) इति ॥

Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn begins, like the last one, with a strong statement of Indra’s relationship with  soma, but it then turns to more general praises of the god (vss. 2–8), with some strik ing similes, metaphors, and etymological figures. The importance of mortal praise and  worship for maintaining Indra’s powers is not forgotten; see verses 7–8 and especially  verse 6, which seems to concern the traffic in praise: inspiration going out from Indra  to the poets and then returning to him as praise (for a similar sentiment and phraseol ogy, see VI.34.1). The last two verses (9–10) ask for Indra’s gifts and protection.
