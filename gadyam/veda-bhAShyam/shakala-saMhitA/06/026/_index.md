Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn begins (vss. 1–2) with an appeal to Indra for help in battles and contests,  much as in the immediately preceding hymn. The first two verses also play with  the word vā́ja “prize,” perhaps punning on the name of the poet and his bardic  clan, Bharad-vāja. The middle part of the hymn (vss. 3–6) gives brief accounts of  Indra’s battles against various named enemies and his aid to various named mortal  allies; in this structure it is very reminiscent of VI.20, and many of the same inci  
dents, with the same, often obscure names, are found in both hymns. The final two  verses (7–8) beg Indra to show the same powers in aid of the poet and his patrons.  The structure of the hymn is thus both fairly conventional and also symmetrical,  with requests to the god in the first two and last two verses and the middle four  verses providing previous models for the aid the god is asked to supply.  
Stylistically noteworthy is the regular fronting of the personal pronoun. Beginning  with verse 2, every half-verse through 5a has a fronted form of the 2nd-person sin gular pronoun “you” (and usually another one in an even pāda: 2d, 3b, 4d), either  nominative tuvám or accusative tvā́m. The rest of verse 5 briefly breaks the pat tern, which returns in verse 6. Then, interestingly, the 1st person asserts itself: 7a  ahám “I”, 8a vayám “we,” with 2nd-person genitive táva (7b) and instrumental  tváyā (7c) interspersed. This distribution corresponds to the thematic structure of  the hymn, with the recounting to Indra of his own deeds followed by requests of  him by us mortals on our own behalf. Verse 7 brings the 1st person “I” and 2nd  person “you” into happy conjunction.
