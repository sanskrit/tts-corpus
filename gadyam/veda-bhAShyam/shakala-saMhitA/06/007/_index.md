7 (448)  
Agni Vaiśvānara  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 6–7  
The hymn is dedicated to Agni as Vaiśvānara (“belonging to all men”), but the  focus is primarily on his relationship with the gods (see, e.g., vss. 1–2, 4), on his  cosmic reach and cosmogonic powers (see, e.g., vss. 1, 5–7), in which aspect he  is identified with the sun (see esp. vs. 5), and, especially, on his birth: the root jan  
“beget/be born” is found in each of the first five verses. It is only verse 3 that depicts  Agni’s relationship with mortals.

Agni Vaiśvānara As noted in the published introduction, this hymn is heavily seeded with forms of √jan ‘beget, be born’. The epithet vaiśvānará- is also found in every vs. (1b, 2c, 3c, 4d, 5a, 6a, 7a), in all cases initial in its pāda.
