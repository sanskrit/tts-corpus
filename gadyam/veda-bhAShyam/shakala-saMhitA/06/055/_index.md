Pūsaṇ  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
This little hymn is noteworthy for its structure, with a lexical chain knitting the  verses together: each verse, except the last (6), contains at least one word or phrase  from the preceding verse. The last verse does contain a phonological echo of the  preceding one: “brother” in verse 5 (bhrā́tā) is echoed by the last word of verse 6  (“bearing” bíbhrataḥ).  
It is also noteworthy for the startling, but oddly offhand and uncensorious, allu sion to incest in verses 4–5, where Pūṣan is identified as the lover of his sister and  the wooer of his mother. This follows on three verses (1–3) seeking Pūṣan as chari oteer and giver of wealth, and after the incest verses the poet returns to the chariot  motif to end the hymn (vs. 6). What the poet is alluding to is Pūṣan’s alleged mar riage to Sūryā, Daughter of the Sun, glancingly mentioned in nearby VI.58.4 as  well as in X.26.6.

Pūṣan As noted in the published introduction, the hymn is structured by an ever-shifting lexical chain. The links are as follows: vs. 1 rathī́ḥ -- 2 rathī́tamam / 2 rāyáḥ sákhā́yam -- 3 rāyáḥ ... sákhā / 3 ajāśva -- 4 ajā́śvam / 4 svásur ... jāráḥ -- 5 svásur jāráh. For the last vs. which lacks a precise repetition, note bhrā́tā in 5 phonologically echoed by bíbhrataḥ ending 6, although they are of course lexically unrelated. We might also note that the verb in 1b, sacāvahai ‘let us two accompany each other’, is echoed by the ‘companion’ word sákhi- in vss. 2, 3, and 5, and ajá- ‘goat’, found in the cmpd.

ajā́śva- ‘having goats as horses’ of vss. 3-4, reappears in 6 without the horses.
