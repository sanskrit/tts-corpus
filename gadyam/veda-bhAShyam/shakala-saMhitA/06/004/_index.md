Agni  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
A more conventionally structured hymn than the last two with less knotty phrase ology. It begins (vs. 1) by asking Agni to sacrifice for us today as always, in his  accustomed role (vs. 2). It ends (vss. 7–8) with a statement of our service to Agni  and prayers for benefits. The verses in between (3–6) describe fire in its naturalistic  aspect, as in the two previous hymns but generally in more straightforward terms  (vs. 5 is an exception and has been variously interpreted).
