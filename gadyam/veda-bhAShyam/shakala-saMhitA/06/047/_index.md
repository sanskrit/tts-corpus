Soma, Indra, etc.  
Garga Bhāradvāja  
31 verses: triṣṭubh, except br̥hatī 19, anuṣṭubh 23, gāyatrī 24, dvipadā 25, jagatī 27  
Like III.53, the family hymn of the Viśvāmitras, dedicated primarily to Indra and  placed at the end of the Indra cycle in Maṇḍala III, this hymn is the family hymn of  the Bharadvājas, dedicated primarily to Indra and also positioned at the end of the  Indra cycle in its maṇḍala. Also like III.53, VI.47 consists of a number of smaller  units, some of which seem to have little or no connection with each other. Different  scholars have suggested different divisions of the hymn; our own is based in great  part on arguments based on rhetoric.834 VI.47  
It begins with an extravagant praise of soma (vss. 1–5), rhetorically unified by  the oft-repeated pronoun “this one here” (ayám), which in several of its occurrences  takes an unusual final position (as opposed to its standard initial slot). With the  presence of soma unquestionably established, Indra is then invited to drink it in  the following verse (6), with the ritual context explicitly identified as the Midday  Pressing. In fact already toward the end of the soma verses, there has been a modu  
lation toward Indra: several of the deeds attributed to “this one here” are more  Indraic than Somian, especially the propping of heaven in 5cd, and the final words  of verse 5 “the bull accompanied by the Maruts” would ordinarily uniquely identify  Indra, who is addressed in the next pāda (6a).  
The extended middle section of the hymn (vss. 7–21) is entirely devoted to Indra.  Verses 7–10 contain a series of direct pleas, for Indra to lead us forward to wider  space and a better life and to provide refreshment and a good life. The next three  verses (11–13) are similarly general, but couched in the 3rd person. (Two of these  verses [12–13] are repeated in a very late hymn, X.131.6–7, and in turn are used in  the later Sautrāmaṇī ritual, but we see no direct evidence of that ritual here.) Indra  appears in these verses as a sort of universal protector and helper. This character  
ization seems to raise questions in the poet’s mind: if Indra is the protector of all,  then how does any particular group get ahead?  
This implicit question prompts the next, somewhat jarring, section of the hymn  (vss. 14–19), which concerns the fickle and unpredictable way in which Indra’s  patronage flits from one man to another. The section begins undramatically by  announcing the many verbal and ritual offerings to Indra, coming (it seems) from  many different groups (vs. 14), all seeking his aid. The next verse (15) seems to treat  Indra’s capriciousness as a positive trait: he doesn’t only and always aid the strong,  but will frequently promote a man who has fallen behind. The next two verses (16– 17) continue this theme, but with Indra’s behavior appearing in a darker light, as he  arbitrarily breaks his agreements and betrays his followers. In the following verse  (18) Indra is infinitely multiplied, presenting a different appearance to each differ  
ent group and seemingly possessed of a thousand horses, each pair of which might  take him to a different group pleading for his aid. This somewhat disturbing section  is brought to a happy end in verse 19: only one pair of horses is yoked (to bring  Indra to us?), the various forms are under Tvaṣṭar’s control, and in the rhetorical  question that forms the second half-verse (matching the question in vs. 15)  it is  concluded that Indra is unlikely to stay with the enemy when our own patrons are  now providing such a good sacrifice. One of the most notable aspects of this little  section (esp. vss. 15–18) about Indra’s constantly changing behavior is its grammati cal reflection: these verses are packed with āmreḍita nominal compounds “each x,  x after x” and so-called “intensive” verb forms (really iterative-frequentative, mean  
ing “keeps x-ing, continually x-es”), forms that are relatively marked in the Vedic  grammatical system. The presence of four āmreḍitas and four intensives in four  verses both calls attention to the message and reflects it by portraying a regularly  alternating set of actions and objects. The reassurance of verse 19 has come none too soon, for in verse 20 the poet  and his group find themselves in a bad spot, not the wide and bountiful place they  prayed Indra to lead them to in verses 7–8. In verse 21 the opposing forces are over come (by Indra, it seems, though he is unnamed). Thus, verses 7–8 and 20–21 form  a larger ring around the Indra section.  
A dānastuti follows (vss. 22–25), in which the victorious kings distribute the  bounty won in the battle referred to in verse 21. The dānastuti proceeds briskly and  efficiently, without any of the jocularity commonly found in dānastutis elsewhere,  just a list of the acquisitions.  
The last part of the hymn (vss. 26–31) is the strangest. It consists of three verses  (26–28) addressed to the war chariot and three (29–31) addressed to the war drum.  These verses are also found in the Atharvaveda (VI.125–126). Each of these martial  objects is praised in the most extravagant terms and compared with the attributes  of the gods. Although this section seems to have no direct connection with the rest  of the hymn, it may have been attached to the hymn (or even originally composed  as part of it) in response to the battle depicted in verses 20–21 and the distribution  of booty in verses 22–25. Chariots are part of the gift (24a), and it would not be  surprising that a war drum might be allotted as part of the post-battle distribution.  It is also worth remembering that in III.53, the family hymn of the Viśvāmitras  mentioned above, one of the final sections (vss. 17–20) is devoted to the possible  perils besetting a chariot and its team, with phraseology similar to verses 26–28 in  this hymn.

Indra ### 01-05 As indicated in the published introduction, the first 5 vss. of the hymn constitute a praise of soma, shading, towards the end, into simultaneous praise of Indra. It is formally unified: beginning with vs. 2, all but one (2cd) of the hemistichs begins with ayám, and vs. 1 contains four exx. of ayám as well (2 each in the 1st 2 pādas), though oddly positioned.
