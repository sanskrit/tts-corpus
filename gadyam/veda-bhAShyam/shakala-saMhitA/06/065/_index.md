65 (506)  
Dawn  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
In virtual mirror-image to the previous hymn, this one begins with a single Dawn,  but turns for some verses (2–4) to the plural Dawns, before returning to a single  Dawn in the final two verses (5–6). The structure of this hymn is more cunning  than the somewhat bland VI.64, however. The poet uses identical pāda openings  (4a, 4b, 4c, 5a: idā́ [hí] “[for] right now...”), with insistence on the here-and-now,  to modulate from the present situation and current poet to the mythological model  for the dawn and the associated distribution of treasures, namely the Aṅgirases  opening the Vala cave (vs. 5), which is presented as if it were happening now. As  often when this myth is mentioned as a model for the singer (see, e.g., V.45), there  is no mention of Indra, to whom the leadership in this deed is usually attributed.  By the end of verse 5 the mythical and successful Aṅgirases have merged with the  current poets, and the invocation of both is proclaimed as having come true. The  connection between past and present is continued in the pleas for wealth and fame  made in the last verse (6).
