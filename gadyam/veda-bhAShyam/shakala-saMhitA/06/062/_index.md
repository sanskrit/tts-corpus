॥ श्रीगणेशाय नमः ॥

वागीशाद्याः सुमनसः सर्वार्थानामुपक्रमे ।

यं नत्वा कृतकृत्याः स्युस्तं नमामि गजाननम् ॥

यस्य निःश्वसितं वेदा यो वेदेभ्योऽखिलं जगत् ।

निर्ममे तमहं वन्दे विद्यातीर्थमहेश्वरम् ॥

अथ पञ्चमाष्टके प्रथमोऽध्याय आरभ्यते । षष्ठमण्डलस्य षष्ठेऽनुवाके चतुर्दश सूक्तानि । तत्र ‘स्तुषे नरा' इत्येकादशर्चं प्रथम सूक्तम् । अत्रेयमनुक्रमणिका- स्तुष एकादशाश्विनं तु' इति । मण्डलद्रष्टा बार्हस्पत्यो भरद्वाज ऋषिः । अनुक्तत्वात् त्रिष्टुप् । अश्विनौ देवता । प्रातरनुवाक आश्विने क्रतौ इदमादिके द्वे सूक्ते । आश्विनशस्त्रे चैते एव । सूत्रितं च- स्तुषे नरेति सूक्ते' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ४. १५ ) इति ॥

Aśvins  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first five verses of this hymn cover the familiar ground of Aśvin hymns—the  poet’s eager invitation to the two gods to drive to our sacrifice. Though the theme  and sentiments are familiar, there are a number of nice touches—the enjambment  across verse boundaries (1/2a; 2bcd/3a, at least in our opinion) and the play on the  concepts of newer and older in verses 4–5. This section ends (5d) with the phrase,  modifying the Aśvins, “providing bright gifts to the singer” (gr̥ṇaté citrárātī).  
The following two verses (6–7) touch on several of the Aśvins’ famous deeds,  especially the rescue of Bhujyu from the sea (vs. 6), but the two verses after that  (8–9) take a detour, addressing other gods and urging them to take violent action  against various enemies. The poet seems so agitated that he loses his grip on gram  
mar:  verse 9, concerning Mitra and Varuṇa, is syntactically fragmented, shift ing without warning or grammatical agreement between dual and singular and  between 3rd and 2nd person. (We have not been able to render the full effect in  English.)  
Though verse 10 returns us to the Aśvins’ journey and to a more tranquil gram matical level, it too enlists the Aśvins to attack and also suggests that their journey  to us was prompted by the failure of other men. The final verse gives no hint of  the agitation in the immediately preceding verses and ends with the same phrase as  verse 5, thus implicitly indicating the bipartite structure of the hymn.

Aśvins The first part of the hymn is marked by repeated dual prns. opening the vs. or hemistich: 1c yā́, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a tā́, 5c yā́, 6a tā́. This pattern more or less coincides with the division of the hymn discussed in the published introduction. After the beg. of vs. 6 the pattern is broken and does not reappear.
