16 verses: triṣṭubh 1–12, uṣṇih 13–15, anuṣṭubh 16  
This sixteen-verse hymn falls metrically into three quite unequal portions: 1–12,  13–15, and 16. On the basis of both structure and content, it appears that these  were originally at least two separate hymns. Verses 1–12 are unitary in tone, and  the central, responsive verses 6–7 can be interpreted as an omphalos, supported  by various lexical rings. (Oldenberg [1888: 199–200], however, divides these twelve  verses into four tr̥ca hymns.)  
The hymn so defined differs markedly from the last two All God hymns (VI.49– 50), which catalogue a series of gods and their attributes in an unordered list. This  hymn, in contrast, is highly reminiscent of the Mitra, Varuṇa, and Sūrya hymns in  Maṇḍala VII (VII.60–63), in which the Sun surveys the human world and bears wit ness to Mitra and Varuṇa about the innocence and guilt of men. Like those hymns,  this begins with the rising of the sun (vss. 1–2); it then turns to praise of the Ādityas.  The emphasis is on their truth and lack of deceit—Ādityan preoccupations.  

The omphalos verses (6–7), marked by initial repeated mā́ “don’t!,” beg the gods  not to subject us to undeserved punishment, thus implicitly claiming our innocence,  which should be visible to the all-seeing Sun (though the final pāda of the follow ing vs. 8 seems to allow the possibility of a modicum of guilt). The remaining five  verses (8–12) return to the theme of the truthful gods, with somewhat more insis tent prayers for grace and help. Toward the end, in verse 11, a larger group of gods  is named: invocations of additional gods at the end of a hymn are very common.  The last verse (12), naming the priestly family and summarizing the content and  intent of the hymn that precedes it, is a typical final verse.  
The remaining verses (13–16) may have been appended to this hymn because they  chiefly concern various malefactors whom we wish to banish or destroy, including  the cheat (ripú, vs. 13) and the (clearly human) “wolf” (vŕ̥ka, vs. 14), both of which  were also mentioned as dangers in the omphalos verses (“cheat” vs. 7, “wolf” vs. 6).
