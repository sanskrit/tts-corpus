9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas  
For most of its short compass, this hymn is a simple celebration of the rewards  and protection the Ādityas grant to their devotee. The only notable aspect of these  verses is the pervasive imagery of journeys and their potential risks.  
It is only the last two verses (8–9) that introduce interesting complications. This  last tr̥ca begins (vs. 7) with a deliberative question—how shall we make our praise  of the gods succeed? The advice in the next two verses seems to be (translated into  modern American political parlance) “Don’t go negative!” In verse 8 the poet for  
swears responding directly to a rival behaving with hostility and affirms his inten tion to use only positive means to win the gods. The first two pādas of verse 9 depict  the rivalry in terms of the ever-popular ancient Indian dice game (see esp. X.34),  counseling the poet that you can never tell what your opponent has up his sleeve  until all the cards are on the table. (We have recast this vignette into the language  of modern card-playing, which works remarkably well—even to the holding of the  four winning tokens, aces in our recasting, which in the Indian dice game would be  a handful of vibhītaka nuts divisible by four.) The lesson seems to be that, given the  possibility that your opponent might have some successful tricks of his own, you  should engage him as little as possible and concentrate on your positive praises of  the gods.
