Sūrya  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
As in most hymns and verses dedicated to Sūrya, the Sun, this hymn focuses  on his rising. His function as eye of the gods, especially Mitra and Varuṇa, is  mentioned in verse 1 (and in our opinion also in verse 5), and the activity that  his rising inspires, both ritual and mundane, in verse 3. Verses 4 and 5 are more enigmatic and have occasioned much discussion: many scholars believe that both  verses contrast the sun of the day with the “night sun,” the dark side of the sun  that, in the form of a wheel, travels invisibly from west to east to position itself  for the next daily rising. Thus, in such interpretations, in the first half of verse 4  Night gathers up the dark garment she was weaving (see II.38.4) at the advent of  the rising sun, but swathes the night sun in her garment in the second half of the  verse. Two sides of the sun, bright and dark, are also referred to, more clearly,  in the second half of verse 5. Although these interpretations have much in their  favor, we still remain uncertain about what verses 4 and 5 are actually depicting.  On the one hand, the interpretations offered seem too cut-and-dried for the fluid  cosmology of the R̥gveda; on the other, given the usual concentration on the  happy event of sunrise, too much mention of the less auspicious night sun seems  somewhat out of place.
