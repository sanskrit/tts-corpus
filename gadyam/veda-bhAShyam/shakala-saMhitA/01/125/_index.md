Svanaya’s Dānastuti  
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa  
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 4–5  
This hymn falls into two distinct but thematically connected parts. The second part  (vss. 4–7) develops an extravagant picture of the rewards that accrue to the gener ous giver and sacrificer. The whole cosmos seems to exist only to gratify him, and  a place among the gods as an immortal awaits him. The syntax and sentiments are  straightforward and indeed somewhat simplistic.  
The other section (vss. 1–3) is quite different. It consists of an apparent dia logue between an “early-coming” figure (vs. 3) and, probably, a householder or  host (vs. 2), with a scene-setting introduction (vs. 1). The word “early-coming”  (prātarítvan) is found only in this hymn and in a narrative in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (besides the later etymological work, the Nirukta), where the same dialogic rela tionship between the Prātaritvan and a householder, in that case Manu, obtains.  In both passages the Prātaritvan seems to be an itinerant priest or poet, offer ing his ritual services to a sacrificer, his potential host. But he also stands in for  or represents a god who is coming to attend the early-morning ritual. (Compare  the compound of similar form and similar meaning prātaryā́van “early-driving,  early-traveling,” used especially of the Aśvins and their chariot.) Thus, the host is  

more inclined to receive the itinerant Prātaritvan because he may be entertaining  a god in disguise, and the Prātaritvan is not only seeking payment for his ritual  work, the dakṣiṇā whose giver is lyrically celebrated in verses 4–7, but also himself  brings (or claims to bring) goods and good fortune for his host, as is emphasized  in all three verses of this portion of the hymn. The relationship between them is  also presented as somewhat coercive or threatening in the second half of verse 2  (which unfortunately contains several hapaxes and is therefore not very clear). The  Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā narrative, a version of “Manu’s Cups,” depicts that threat much  more strongly, as an aspect of the “anxieties of hospitality.” For further discussion  see Jamison (1996a: 184–89).
