67  
Agni  
Parāśara Śāktya  
10 verses: dvipadā virāj  
Although this hymn contains several similes (see vss. 1, 2, 5, 10), the simile is not the  organizing principle of the hymn, unlike I.65–66, and metaphors and personifica tions share the stage with formally marked similes.  
Agni’s disappearance and hiding (vss. 3, 6–7) and his discovery by the gods  (vss. 3–4), and by implication by pious mortals (vss. 7–8), provide the mythologi cal theme of the hymn. The physical counterpart to this mythic concealment is the  immanence of fire in wood, in plants, and in water, mentioned at the beginning (vs.  1) and end (vss. 9–10) of the hymn. For similar themes, see I.65.
