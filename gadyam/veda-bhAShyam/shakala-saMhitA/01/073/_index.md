73  
Agni  
Parāśara Śāktya  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
This last hymn of the Parāśara Agni cycle recapitulates some of the poetic devices  and themes found in the earlier hymns and thus in some sense provides the close of  a ring to the whole sequence. It begins with three verses dense with similes, recalling  the first two hymns, I.65–66, which were similarly simile rich. The three verses are  entirely descriptive of Agni, particularly of the sacrificial fire in its position on the  ritual ground, but the god’s name is not mentioned until verse 4, where he is kindled  by men.  
The rest of the hymn concerns Agni as the central focus of humans, of gods, and  of ritual substances (for this last, see vs. 6), Agni as a distributor and redistributor  of goods and services among gods, patrons, and poets, a role summed up in the  word “portion” found in verses 5, 6, 7, and 10. This theme was announced in the  first pāda of the hymn, and the “wealth acquired from one’s father” of 1a recurs in  verse 9.  
Although this hymn lacks overt reference to the motifs of the Vaiśvānara  fire and the Tānūnaptra rite, in which men and gods respectively become united  by joint action involving the fire, the interrelations among men, among gods,  and among men and gods depicted in this hymn recall the more explicit treat  
ment of those motifs in earlier parts of the cycle. That both gods and men  and, among men, both poets and patrons serve the fire in similar ways and  seek similar rewards depicts these groups of beings as having a certain equality  before Agni.
