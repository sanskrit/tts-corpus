135  
Vāyu (1–3, 9), Indra and Vāyu (4–8)  
Paruchepa Daivodāsi  
9 verses: atyaṣṭi, except aṣṭi 7–8, arranged in tr̥cas  
The second of Paruchepa’s Vāyu hymns is longer than the first, and presumably  originally consisted of three hymns, corresponding to the tr̥ca divisions. For most  of its length it is preoccupied with the usual themes of Vāyu hymns: Vāyu’s journey  to the sacrifice with his many teams and his right to the first drink of soma at the  Morning Pressing. The first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) is an invitation to Vāyu alone; the second  (vss. 4–6), thematically and verbally parallel to the first, is addressed to Vāyu and  Indra, who share the second soma oblation at the Morning Pressing.  
The last tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is less straightforward. The first of its verses (7) seems to  describes an ongoing sacrifice to which Vāyu and Indra are traveling, a journey con tinued in the first part of verse 8. And the fortunate results of the successful sacri fice are described at the end of verse 8, the thriving of stock and agriculture. But in  between is the mention of a mysterious fig tree. The final verse (9) is even more mys terious, with its unidentified oxen of paradoxical movement and habits. Since the  vocabulary is reminiscent of the Marut lexicon, the oxen may be the Maruts, and  the association of Vāyu (Wind) with the thunderstorm may be depicted. The pas sage also reminds us of the mysterious oxen in I.105.10, which may be astronomical  

phenomena. And, of course, in a hymn focused on the soma sacrifice, any unidenti fied referent may be the soma drinks.
