Indra  
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra  
10 verses: gāyatrī  
A generally unremarkable hymn, with the usual offering of soma and praise to  Indra in return, we hope, for help and favor. The favors especially desired are help  and support in battles and raids and the victory prizes won in them (see vss. 3–4,  9–10), and the hymn ends (vs. 10) on a slightly worried note, with a reference to our  enemies among men.  
Structurally, the hymn divides into two halves. In the first (vss. 1–5), the poet  addresses his fellow priests, commanding them to sing the songs, pointing to the  prepared soma, and declaring what Indra can do. In the second half (vss. 6–10) he  turns to Indra himself, reminding the god what the offerings will do for him. The  birth of Indra (vs. 6) refers not only to his ancient birth but also to his appearance  at this sacrifice. The single day in which he achieves his full strength is the sacrificial  day, so that by the end of the day, he has the power to help the sacrificers.
