78  
Agni  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
5 verses: gāyatrī  
A hymn of uninspired content, which is rigidly structured and dominated by its  refrain. Its most noteworthy feature is that the first two pādas of the last verse  (5) break the pattern of the preceding ones, and it is here that the name Agni  appears for the first and only time in the hymn, with the reference switched from  the 2nd person of the rest of the hymn to 3rd person in its final verse. It is also  striking that in verses 1 and 4 the refrain is syntactically integral to the verse,  with the initial “to you” the object of the verb in the third-pāda refrain, whereas  in the middle verses 2–3 the refrain is syntactically separate, and the initial “to  you” is construed with the verb in the first hemistich. Thus, its formal properties  are the whole point of the hymn, with meaning essentially backgrounded. For  discussion of other ways in which Gotama privileges form over content, see the  introduction to I.75.

Agni See the published introduction. for the structure of this rather dull hymn. Not only is the third and final pāda identical in the first four (of five) verses, but in these same verses the opening of the first pāda is also rigidly structured: abhí tvā (vs. 1), tám u tvā (vss. 2-4). The remainder of the first pāda of these verses consists of two variant pairs: gótamā girā́(vs. 1), gótamo girā́(vs. 2); vājasā́tamam (vs. 3), vṛtrahántamam.

It is thus only the second pāda of each verse that contains fully independent material.

The tvā in the various a-pādas has a slightly different syntactic status in this seemingly rigid schema. In vs. 1 it serves as the goal of the verb in pāda c, with doubling of the preverb abhí (a, c). (Alternatively one can supply a verb in ab and an object in c, as Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) do, but this seems uneconomical.) In the following two verses it is governed by a verb in pāda b (2 duvasyati, 3 havāmahe), leaving nonumaḥ in c without an expressed object. In vs. 4 it is again the goal of the verb in c, with an apparent embedded relative clause in b.
