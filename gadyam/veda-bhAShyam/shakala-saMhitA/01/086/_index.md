Maruts  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
10 verses: gāyatrī  
The first half of this hymn has a remarkably intricate syntactic structure, especially  for a gāyatrī hymn. Verse 1 makes the outlines of this structure clear: a genitive rela tive pronoun (yásya “whose, of whom”) introducing a clause in which the Maruts  perform some service for the man so identified, with a main clause expressing the  rewards this man receives. (Roughly paraphrased, in vs. 1  “whose dwelling you  protect, he has the best protector.”) With this structure set, the poet feels free to  attenuate and manipulate it. In our view, verses 2 and 3 are examples of this same  structure, but the yásya has been gapped in verse 2 and must be supplied from verse  1, along with a verb for 2a. Moreover, the main clause expressing the reward is  postponed until verse 3c, and there are three different relative clauses that it com  
pletes (2a, 2bc, 3ab). The repeated vā’s (“or”) allow this submerged structure to be  discerned, despite the gapping. The three clauses define three different beneficiaries  of the Maruts’ favor: the sacrificer (2a), the poet himself (2bc), or the poet’s patron  (“prize-seeker” 3ab).  
Verses 4–5 continue the fronted genitive pattern, but now with a demonstra tive pronoun, not a relative. The referent is still the Maruts’ client, and his success  becomes magnified in these verses; not only is his sacrifice a success (vs. 4), but he  subjugates the surrounding peoples, and his sacrificial offerings go all the way to  heaven (vs. 5).  
Verse 6 abruptly switches to the 1st plural from the 3rd singular: it’s we who  have been performing all this sacrificial labor, and the poet implicitly identifies us with the anonymous hard-working and well-rewarded man of the first five  verses. The 3rd sg. sacrificer returns in verses 7–8, with the syntactic structure  switched: the main clause and happy reward precede the relative yásya clause (see  esp. vs. 7). The last two verses call on the Maruts for their help, especially against  aggressors.  
Gotama’s penchant for elaborate and varied syntactic patterning has been noted  previously in the introductions to several of his hymns.
