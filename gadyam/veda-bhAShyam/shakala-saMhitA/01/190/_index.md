Br̥haspati  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Br̥haspati, the lord of formulations, is here presented as both producer and receiver  of sacred speech and sound. This theme is established in the first verse, where  my chants strengthen Br̥haspati, who himself is the “leader of song.” The physi cal movement of words and sound—between mortals and gods, between earth  and heaven—is a repeated theme in the hymn (see esp. vss. 2, 4, 7). The difficult  verses 3 and 4 concern a particular kind of sacred sound, the signal-call (ślóka)  that Br̥haspati launches daily, most likely a call announcing the sacrifice or some  part of it.  
The Br̥haspati depicted in this hymn is no mere gentle wordsmith, but militant  and aggressive, compared to a bellowing bull (vs. 1), a fearsome wild beast (vss. 3,  4), a bird of prey (vs. 7). His words are missiles (vs. 4), and those who underestimate  him and seek to exploit him receive his punishment (vs. 5).
