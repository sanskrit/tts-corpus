Aśvins  
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
The structure of the hymn is straightforward. It begins with an invitation to the  Aśvins to come to the sacrifice on their chariot. Indeed, it is their chariot that is  the focus of the poet’s attention through most of the first half of the poem. The  triplets associated with the chariot—its three chariot boxes (vss. 1–2), three wheels  (2), and three turnings (2)—suggest the sacrifice itself with its three soma offer  
ings. Within the poem, therefore, the ritual performance thus becomes an image  of the Aśvins’ chariot, and its realization a sign of the arrival of the Aśvins. The  chariot not only brings the Aśvins to the sacrifice but it also brings help to the  sacrificer (vs. 1). Ancient poets have told of the help of the Aśvins (3cd), and the  second part of the poem (vss. 5–9) begins with a recital of the many men and even  animals in their many desperate situations whom the Aśvins have helped. The  hymn then returns to the poet’s own need for help (vs. 10), and in verse 11 there  is once again a summons of the Aśvins. The last verse creates a formal ring, for  just as in verse 1 the Aśvins should come quickly in their “falcon-winged chariot”  (ráthaḥ. . .śyenápatvā), so in verse 11 the Aśvins should come with the “fresh speed  of a falcon” (śyenásya jávasā nū́tanena).
