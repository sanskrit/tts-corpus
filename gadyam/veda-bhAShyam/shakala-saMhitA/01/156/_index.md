Viṣṇu  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
5 verses: jagatī  
The primary deed of Viṣṇu, his claim to fame—the three strides—is not mentioned  directly in this hymn. Instead, he is presented as a protean divinity, likened to or  identified with a number of other gods, especially Agni. This superimposition begins  with the first pāda of verse 1, where he is compared to Mitra, and in verse 2b the  association with the Wives of the Gods immediately brings Tvaṣṭar to mind. In verse  4d he is identified either with Indra/Br̥haspati or with an Aṅgiras in the allusion to  the Vala myth, and earlier in that verse (pāda b) “the ritual expert associated with  the Maruts” may be a reference to Indra, who may be called “ritual expert of the  Maruts” (vedho marútām) in I.169.1. But the primary association appears to be with  Agni. The title “ritual expert,” though used of other gods (like Indra, see above), is  especially characteristic of Agni, and the references to Viṣṇu as embryo and to his  birth (vss. 2–3) are typical Agni themes (compare 3b especially with VI.48.5, of the  birth of Agni). The “three seats” in verse 5 also recalls Agni with his three hearths,  and this word may in fact signal the point of contact between Viṣṇu and Agni, since  “three” is the number that defines Viṣṇu’s great deed, and the “three seats” could  be the three footprints left by his strides. (See the footprints as places in I.154.4–6.)  
The theme of Viṣṇu’s multiple identities is announced, in typically oblique  fashion, in the middle verse of this hymn:  “recognizing him, announce his very  names” (3c).
