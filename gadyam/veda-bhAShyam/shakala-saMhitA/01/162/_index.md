Praise of a Horse (Aśvastuti)  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
22 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 3, 6  
The first of the two Aśvamedha hymns focuses on the actual sacrifice, with an  almost cinematic treatment of the proceedings and an unflinching look at the gory  details. The hymn begins with the parading of the horse on the day of sacrifice: the  year-long preliminaries in the classical Aśvamedha are not mentioned here, and it  is not easy to tell how much elaboration accreted to this ritual in the post-R̥gvedic  period—though it seems likely that the R̥gvedic version was a much simpler affair.  
After an initial verse calling on an array of gods to bear witness to the celebra tion of the horse, there follow three verses (2–4) devoted to the goat that is led  in front of the horse and that is itself sacrificed before the killing of the horse.  The goat is the only sacrificial animal mentioned in the hymn besides the horse,  in contrast to the classical version of the rite in which a multitude of wild and  domestic animals are, at least theoretically, bound for sacrifice (and in general  then released). In verses 5–6 a variety of priests (5) and minor ritual functionaries  (6; see also the cooks in vs. 12) are mentioned—the priests being urged, somewhat  shockingly, to “fill your bellies” on the sacrifice. This group of officiants seems to  correspond on the human level to the gods assembled in verse 1, and all are thus  implicated in the performance of the sacrifice, as are the poet himself and his fel  
low seers in verse 7.  
The gaze then turns to the sacrifice proper (vss. 8–17) and to the equipment asso ciated with the horse (vss. 8, 14, 16), the equipment for cooking the oblation (vs.  13), and, most dramatically, the physical evidence of the slaughter: the fly-blown  flesh and the sticky blood and guts (vs. 9), the bloated belly and the smell of the  butchered animal (vs. 10), the cooking juices running off the skewered beast on344 I.162  
the fire (vs. 11). All of the mentioned paraphernalia and the gore are meant to  accompany the horse itself to the gods. This section of the hymn gains much of its  power from a dual focus: the gritty reality of an actual sacrifice competes with the  reverential attitude to the victim, regularly addressed in the 2nd person—such that  the horse is endowed almost with personhood while at the same time being dismem  
bered, cooked, and consumed. For this reason, in 3rd-person contexts we use the  pronouns “he, him, his” for the horse, rather than “it,” et cetera: the poet will not  allow us to objectify or neuter-ize the animal and requires us to come to terms with  what “we” are doing to “him.”  
The description of the dismembering becomes more detailed beginning in verse  18, where the axe approaches the horse’s ribs. Although this carving up logically  precedes some of the sacrificial actions treated before—especially the cooking of the  already butchered horse—there is a reason for its positioning here. We are entering  the third and last part of the hymn, in which the horse is sent on his journey to the  gods. The emphasis in these carving verses (18–20) is on the proper order of the cut  
ting and the patterned positioning of the pieces of the horse, so that he can make its  own way on his “undamaged” legs (vss. 18, 20). The pieces of the horse are arranged  to re-form the actual body of the horse, and this reconstituted body is complemented  by the lifebreath (ātman) that is also making the journey to the gods (vs. 20). The  climax is reached in verse 21, where the horse is assured that he is not dead or injured  and that his journey to the gods will be made easily, in company with the mounts of  the gods. The hymn ends (vs. 22) with the hope that the sacrificed horse will bring  us good things, and with an unemphatic prayer for our “guiltlessness,” presumably  because of the potential guilt associated with the killing of the horse.  
To those who know the classical śrauta version of the Aśvamedha the most strik ing omission in this hymn is any mention of the sexual intercourse (or simulated inter course) of the chief wife of the king and sacrificer with the just slaughtered horse. If  our interpretation of X.86, the Vr̥ṣākapi hymn, is correct—that it is a burlesqued ver sion of an Aśvamedha with a randy monkey as victim—the missing sexual element in  our hymn here was omitted out of delicacy rather than being unknown to the R̥gveda.
