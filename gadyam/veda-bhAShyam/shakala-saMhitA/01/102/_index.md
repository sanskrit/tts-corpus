' इमां ते' इति एकादशर्चं नवमं सूक्तं कुत्सस्यार्षमैन्द्रम् । अन्त्यां त्रिष्टुप् शिष्टा दश जगत्यः । तथा चानुक्रान्तम्-' इमां तेऽन्त्या त्रिष्टुप्' इति । विनियोगो लैङ्गिकः ॥

102  
Indra  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
11 verses: jagatī 1–7, triṣṭubh 8–11  
The structure of this hymn is superficially identical to that of its immediate prede cessor, I.101: eleven verses, the first seven in jagatī, the last four triṣṭubh. But the  tight syntactic and formulaic control of I.101 is not present here. Nonetheless, the  

hymn is stitched together by lexical repetitions, and the two metrically diverse seg ments show especially strong lexical responsions.  
The hymn begins with a difficult verse, which has received a number of incom patible interpretations. Ours is, perhaps, especially bold, in that we assume that  the poet (in the 1st person) is speaking to a “you” who is not the god (as most  people assume), but the human praise singer, who may, in fact, be the poet him self. (Such incompatibilities in address are not infrequent in such ritual situ ations; the poet often addresses himself in the 2nd person; see discussion in  Jamison 2009a.) The poet thus announces that the composition of his poem is  complete and it is ready to be recited to its object, the god, who is present in the  verse in the 3rd person.  
After naming the cosmic forces whose activities provide support to Indra (vs.  2), the poet turns to two intertwined themes: the aid we beg from Indra in conflicts  and contests, where, we know, our rivals and foes will be seeking the same aid  (esp. vss. 3–6, 9–10), and the immeasurable power Indra commands, power that  accounts for the desire of all contenders to get him on their side (esp. vss. 6–8).  These latter verses play with forms of the root mā “measure, match.” The transi  
tion between the jagatī and triṣṭubh sections is especially nicely handled: having  claimed in verses 6–7 that Indra has no match in strength, verse 8 takes up the  exact phrase from verse 6, but asserts that indeed there does exist such a match— but it consists of the whole cosmos in all its divisions. The next verse (9) of the  triṣṭubh section densely repeats and rings changes on the lexicon and thematics  from the early parts of the hymn and thus signals a kind of ring composition.  Verse 10 seems to announce the success of our petitions, though in a different  lexicon. The final verse (11) is a refrain verse, repeated from I.100.19, the last half  of which is the general Kutsa refrain.
