3  
Aśvins (1–3), Indra (4–6), All Gods (7–9), Sarasvatī (10–12)  
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra  
12 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas  
See the introduction to the preceding hymn. This hymn is the continuation and  conclusion of the Praügaśastra and follows the order of divinities discussed in the  introduction to I.2. As in I.2, the contents are fairly banal—urging each god or  divine group to come and enjoy our sacrificial offerings.  
In both I.2 and I.3 the tr̥cas contain internal repetitions that unify them, though  these unifying devices are of an elementary type. There are also less apparent link ages between tr̥cas created by verbal repetitions in the last verse of one tr̥ca and the  first of the next. So, for example, I.2.6c and 7c mention our “insight” (dhī́). The last  

pāda (c) of I.3 begins ā́ yātam and 4a has ā́ yāhi “drive here,” both imperatives to  the same root. And 6c and 7c refer to sutá “pressed soma,” though there is no obvi ous link between the third tr̥ca of I.3 and the last one to Sarasvatī.

(Praügaśastra continued) As in I.2 the recipients of the various tṛcas are emphatically signalled. In vss.

1-3 to the Aśvins, the voc. áśvinā opens the first two verses, while their alternative name nāsatyā opens the second pāda of the third. The voc. índra opens all three verses of the next tṛca (4-6). The Viśvedevāḥ tṛca contains three instances of that phrase: the voc. in 7b, nominatives opening vss. 8 and 9. The final tṛca to Sarasvatī likewise contains three occurrences of her name in the nominative, but all three end their pādas (10a, 11c, 12a).
