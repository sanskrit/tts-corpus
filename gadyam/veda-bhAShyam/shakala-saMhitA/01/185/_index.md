Heaven and Earth  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
This eleven-verse hymn falls into two connected sections. Verses 2–8 all end with  a pāda-long refrain; since this refrain seems to be an implicit response to verse 1,  we believe that 1–8 form a coherent whole, ending with an expiatory verse (8) and  then followed by a three-verse summary referring to the hymn-within-a-hymn that  precedes.  
The refrain addressed to Heaven and Earth, “protect us from the formless  void,” expresses the Vedic fear of the darkness and lack of definition character istic of pre-creation chaos. Heaven and Earth help dispel that fear and provide  protection from the void in several ways. They are the defining structures of the  cosmos, and within the shaped space they produce between them, all separate  forms, animate and inanimate, exist. This seems to be the point of verse 1c, “they  carry everything that is a name”; we take this as a version of the later Sanskrit  nāma-rūpa “name and form,” the multiplicity of individual entities, defined by  the conjunction of a physical form and a word for it. Heaven and Earth are also  the parents of the Sun, the light that allows the individual forms to be seen. Their  parentage of the Sun is, in our opinion, the subject of verses 2–4, though the Sun  is not mentioned directly. The embryo of verse 2 is the “gift of Aditi” in verse 3  (the Sun is already called ādityá, son of Aditi in the late R̥gveda; see, e.g., I.191.9),  while verse 4 describes the wonder that Heaven and Earth are never burned by  the Sun, their son. (On this kinship relation, see also the Heaven and Earth hymn  I.160.)  
Heaven and Earth define space, but they also, in part via their son, define  time: the regular alternation of day and night is first mentioned in verse 1d. The two  complementary pairs, Heaven and Earth and Night and Dawn, are treated together  in verse 4c, and in our opinion the siblings of verse 5 are more likely Night and  Dawn than Heaven and Earth, since they are located “in the lap of their parents,”  that is, Heaven and Earth. However, the latter pair are definitely the subject of  verses 6–7, and their role in conception is highlighted again. The final verse of the  refrain-bounded section (8) seeks expiation for an unnamed offense, and offers the  current hymn (“this hymnic vision”) to that end.  
The last three verses (9–11) develop this theme. The poet expresses the hope  that the verbal products he has just produced will help him: his “lauds belonging to men” (a variation on the technical term nárāśáṃsa, vs. 9), and the “truth” he  addressed to Heaven and Earth (vss. 10–11).
