Aśvins  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
Although not at the same degree of difficulty as Agastya’s immediately preceding  hymn to the Aśvins, this one certainly has its share of puzzles—though, as so often,  it restricts itself almost entirely to the Aśvins’ journey to the sacrifice and the sacri fice itself. The hymn begins at the sacrifice, with the Aśvins acting as priests (vs. 1),  but then draws back temporally to the usual invitation to travel to the sacrifice (vss.  2–3). Verse 4 gives us a tantalizing glimpse of a potential differentiation between  the two Aśvins, who are otherwise almost always treated as identical and identically  functioning twins.  
Verses 5–6 are entirely parallel to each other in structure and return to the jour ney theme, but introduce another, though unnamed, figure by way of a slippery use  of the word anyá “other.” In verse 4 paired anyá’s referred to the two individual  Aśvins, but in the following two verses, each containing an anyá in pāda c, the  Aśvins are jointly established in the first half of the verse and implicitly contrast  with the unidentified “other” of pāda c. In our opinion this “other” must be Indra,  identifiable because of the pair of fallow bay horses in 5c, a pair of horses that are  uniquely Indra’s in the R̥gveda. It is not surprising that the Aśvins and Indra  should be journeying at the same time, since both are recipients of parts of the  Morning Pressing.  
The final verses (7–9) take place on the sacrificial ground. Verse 8 is especially  rich in striking images of the ritual: the sacrificial fire is depicted as a “gleaming  wasp” whose sound is likened to a praise hymn, and the imminent mixing of soma  and milk gives rise to a complex erotic image, with the soma a swollen “bullish  cloud” at the “pouring out” (séka) of the milk—its swelling attributed to its sexual  excitement at the “insemination” (séka) of the cow. In general, swelling as a sign of  abundance is a consistent theme in the latter part of the hymn (vss. 5c, 6c, 8b, 8c).
