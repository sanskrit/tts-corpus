Indra  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
16 verses: paṅkti  
Like the justly famous I.32, this hymn is entirely concerned with the Indra–Vr̥tra  battle. It portrays Indra’s defeat of Vr̥tra and his release of the pent-up waters  with admirable clarity, though it lacks the richness of detail of I.32 and the  intimacy of the portrait of the overmatched and then defeated Vr̥tra found in  that other hymn. Instead this hymn simply keeps repeating the climactic moment  when Indra smote Vr̥tra with his mace (vájra). In fact, the mace seems almost  as much the hero of the hymn as Indra is: in the first thirteen verses, those con  
cerned most directly with the Vr̥tra battle, only three (4, 9, 10) lack a mention  of the mace. Verse 8 is especially noteworthy in containing the only occurrence  of plural vájra in the R̥gveda, in a puzzling context: “Your maces have been dis persed across the ninety navigable (rivers).” This passage superficially reminds us  of I.32.14, in which Indra, having slain Vr̥tra, flees in fear across “the ninety-nine  

flowing rivers,” but the implications of our passage seem more positive. Perhaps  the point is that, once the rivers were released to flow in all directions, Indra’s  power, embodied in the mace, was subdivided and spread across the whole fertile,  water-fed landscape.  
The fifth-pāda refrain in every verse is an especially salient feature of the  hymn and concerns the verbal encouragement given to Indra. The subject of  the plural verb árcann ánu is never specified, and since the verb is in the injunc tive, it is ambiguous between present and indefinite mythic past. These uncer tainties are no doubt deliberate: the subject can be the current poet-sacrificers,  their legendary counterparts (Atharvan, Manu, and Dadhyañc mentioned in  vs. 16), or the Maruts, the gods who in mythic time provided encouragement  to Indra before and during the Vr̥tra combat. A direct-speech example of such  encouragement is given in verse 3, and verse 9 encourages the encouragers in  this action. The relationship between the current poets and their predecessors is  built into the structure of the hymn, in a telling ring between the first and last  verses. Verse 1 mentions the formulation created “in the current style” (itthā́),  while in verse 16 formulations made “in the older style” (pūrváthā), imitating  illustrious named past poets and sacrificers, are offered to Indra. Thus the hymn  implicitly suggests that not only was Indra’s great victory impossible without  his cheering comrades, but that poets today, like those in the past, fulfill the  same role.
