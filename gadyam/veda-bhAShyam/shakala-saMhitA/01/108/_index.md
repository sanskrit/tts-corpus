108  
Indra and Agni  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
13 verses: triṣṭubh  
For the ritual pairing of Indra and Agni, see the introduction to I.21. This hymn  is structured by patterned repetition that becomes decidedly more restrictive in the  second half of the hymn. The vocative of the dual dvandva “o Indra and Agni”  occurs in every verse but the middle one (vs. 6). In the first five verses this vocative  moves around the verse (though it always occurs in second position in its pāda), but  in the second half (vss. 7–13) it always occurs in second position of the first pāda,  after the subordinator yád “when” (except in the final verse [13], where it appears  after evā́ in the same position). The second half of these same verses (7–12) is a  refrain, which has slowly been assembled in the earlier part of the hymn: its sec ond half is also found in 1d and 6d, and in part in 5d; the end of its first half first  appears in 6c. These elements all come together first in 7cd. And the first halves of  these same verses are thematically superimposable: in each verse several different  potential locations of the gods are listed, which they are urged to leave in order to  come to us.  
The contents of the first six verses are more various. The united front and the  joint activities of Indra and Agni are emphasized, though some verses have a dis tinctly Indraic character (esp. vs. 3, where both gods are called “Vṛtra-smashers”)  and some are more in Agni’s camp (esp. vs. 4). The middle verse (6) is, as noted  above, the only verse without an address to the gods (or any mention of them  by name), and it also contains 1st-person direct speech. In it the speaker recalls  his words when he “chose” the gods, presumably as his priests, and these words  announce the necessity for competing with others (in this case the other human  “lords” [not, in our opinion, the nonhuman Asuras, the later Vedic opponents of  the gods]) for the gods’ visitation, the theme that will dominate the rest of the hymn.  Though we hesitate to call verse 6 an omphalos, it does serve as pivot point for the hymn, and its deliberately different structure from both what precedes and what  follows marks it and its position as exceptional.
