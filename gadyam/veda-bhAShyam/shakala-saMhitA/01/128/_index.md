Agni  
Paruchepa Daivodāsi  
8 verses: atyaṣṭi  
The sacrificial fire is the relentless focus of this hymn, and it seldom strays from  the physical location of the fire on the ritual ground. Though its theme is clear  and inescapable, the hymn presents us with manifold interpretive difficulties in its  details, especially in the central verses 4–5, which, with their responsive fronted  krátvā (“though his resolve,” 4cd, 5a), may constitute an omphalos. There is also  some sign of ring composition: the first and last (8) verses each twice refer to Agni  as the Hotar, a word used nowhere else in the hymn, and the mentions of Manu in  verses 1–2 are answered by two occurrences of Manu in the penultimate verse (7).  In general there is much reuse of vocabulary through the hymn, and the poet plays  with the words “good” and “goods” in the second part of the hymn (vss. 5–6, 8).  Though the poet does not himself beg for goods, it seems clear that the desire for  goods he attributes to the gods (8fg) is shared by their human counterparts.
