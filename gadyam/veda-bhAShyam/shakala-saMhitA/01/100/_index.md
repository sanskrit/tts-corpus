Indra  
Five Vārṣāgira poets: R̥jrāśva, Ambarīṣa, Sahadeva, Bhayamāna, and Surādhas 19 verses: triṣṭubh  
This first Indra hymn in the Kutsa collection is assigned by the Anukramaṇī to  five named poets with the patronymic Vārṣāgira, only one of whom (Ambarīṣa, of  IX.98) is known from elsewhere. However, the hymn ends with the Kutsa refrain  (vs. 19cd), and the Vārṣāgira attribution must come from the dānastuti, where the  names of these five poets are mentioned (vs. 17, see also 16).  
The first fifteen verses (up to the dānastuti, vss. 16–19) end with a refrain  linking Indra to the Maruts, and one of the main themes of the hymn is com radeship:  Indra joined not only with the Maruts but with other like-minded  beings (see, e.g., vss. 4–5, 10–11). The context is almost exclusively martial,  as Indra joins with his forces and his powers to conquer various foes, though  his standard opponents, like Vr̥tra, are curiously absent. The insistent pres ence of the Maruts may mark this as a hymn for the Midday Pressing, where  Indra and Maruts share the oblation. The next hymn also has a strong Marut  presence.  
The dānastuti finale begins (vs. 16) with the praise of the gift, a fine mare,  but, after naming the Vārṣāgiras (vs. 17), ends with straightforward praise of  Indra.  
Verbally the hymn is structured by the frequent hemistich-initial occurrences  of the pronoun sá “he,” reinforced by plays on this syllable: for instance, verse 1c  satīnásatvā, 18cd sánat. There are also a number of hapaxes, whose translations are  provisional (see vss. 8, 12, 16).
