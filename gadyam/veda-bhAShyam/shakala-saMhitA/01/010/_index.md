Indra  
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra  
12 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Oldenberg (1888:  226)  remarks on the idiosyncratic arrangement of the  Madhuchandas hymns (1–11) and on the location of this and the following  hymn in particular. Contrary to the usual arrangement, the gāyatrī hymns of this  collection (1–9) are placed as a group together before these final two hymns in  anuṣṭubh.  
Though the hymn displays the usual reciprocal balance between what we offer  to Indra and what we ask him for, the poet focuses more on the verbal offerings  we make than on the soma. Songs, praise hymns, and recitations are mentioned in verses 1, 3–5, 9, 12—with a bit of thematic ring composition linking the first verse  and the first half of the last one (12ab).  
As in the last hymn (I.9) reciprocal actions are posited of Indra and his wor shipers. For example in verse 4ab Indra is ordered to respond to our verbal praises  by verbal actions of his own. In 4cd/5ab we first command Indra to strengthen  us and our ritual, and then we produce a recitation meant to strengthen Indra  in turn. We both urge him to enjoy our companionship (5d) and beg him to give  us his (6a). The most ingenious example of reciprocal action is found in verse 7,  in the ambiguous form tvā́dātam. The topic is the Vala myth and the glory that  accrues from opening the Vala cave and driving out the cows. Indra of course is  the major actor in this myth, and tvā́dātam íd yáśaḥ can be interpreted as “(that)  glory is acquired only by you” (based on the idiom ā́ √dā “take, acquire”). But  Indra also shared the action with the Aṅgirases, and the myth is also often rein  
terpreted as engaging human priests in its ritual re-enactment, so that the same  phrase can also mean “(that) glory is given only by you” (with the simplex √dā “give”). Either interpretation is morphologically, grammatically, and contextually  possible.  
There is otherwise little remarkable about the hymn, though in several verses  the poet echoes passages found elsewhere, which he twists to a different, sometimes  opposite meaning (cf. 7b with III.40.6, 8b with I.176.1, and 9ab with VII.32.5).
