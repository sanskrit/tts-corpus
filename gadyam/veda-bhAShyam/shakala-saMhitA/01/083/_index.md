Indra  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
6 verses: jagatī  
In this hymn the poet uses two different senses of the word “first” to imbue the  good sacrificer with the qualities and prestige of the legendary institutors of the sacrifice. At the beginning of verse 1 the good sacrificer is “the first” to attain to  wealth provided by Indra. The next two verses continue the characterization of the  good sacrificer and the good life bestowed on him by the gods. The next two verses  (4–5) pick up the word “first” (prathamá) that opened the hymn, but here not in the  sense of “foremost, first in line” as in verse 1, but rather “primal, original”: these  verses concern the first establishment of the sacrifice and the actions of the famous  primordial sacrificers. In the final verse (6) we return to the current sacrifice, but  by putting the model of the original sacrificers before us, the poet implies that the  present-day sacrificer is replicating their actions and is identified with them. This is  one of the common themes of R̥gvedic sacrifice: that each new sacrifice is an enact ment of the first one.
