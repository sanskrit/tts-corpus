‘बळित्था' इति त्रयोदशर्चं द्वितीयं सूक्तं दैर्घतमसं जागतम् । अन्त्ये त्रिष्टुभौ । अग्निर्देवता । प्रातरनुवाकाश्विनशस्त्रयोरुक्तो विनियोगः ।।

Agni  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
13 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 12–13  
Like the last hymn, this one is full of puzzles, and also like the last, it focuses  especially on the birth and growth of the fire. The hymn begins and ends with the  installation of the ritual fire (root dhā: 1ab, 13ab), providing a faint ring struc ture; the second mention of its installation, with the adverb pratarám “further  

forward,” suggests that it refers to the installation of the new Āhavanīya fire to the  east, a fire removed from the old Āhavanīya at the beginning of classical śrauta  rituals.  
The first few verses cryptically describe the various forms of fire (vs. 2) and their  production (vss. 3–4). The means of production are at first mythical or metaphori cal, but in the second half of verse 4 the more familiar ritual churning of the fire is  described, followed by his growth and rapid and unpredictable movement (vss. 5–8;  see also vs. 1c). This type of erratic movement is iconically mirrored with extraor dinary skill by our poet Dīrghatamas, who models it with abrupt changes of tense  and a deliberate disregard for the usual matching of syntax and verse structure. In  our reading there are enjambments across verses in 3–4, 4–5, and 6–7, with sentence  breaks in verse-interior in 4, 5, 6—a very rare conjunction of syntactic anomalies.  The vertiginous effect of piling clause upon clause and image upon image is espe cially marked in the sequence beginning with 6b and lasting through 7—giving us  a faint whiff of the Gerard Manley Hopkins of “The Windhover,” which models a  bird’s flight with verbal means.  
The rest of the hymn is somewhat more conventional, beginning with verse 9,  where Agni is addressed for the first time in the 2nd person. Until then not only is  the hymn couched entirely in the 3rd person, but the word agní is entirely absent,  either as the name of the god or as a designation of the natural substance fire.  Verses 9–10 describe Agni’s contributions to the welfare of both men and gods,  while verses 12–13 express hopes for further help and summarize the hymn itself.  But even here, in verse 11 the poet plots a meandering syntactic and conceptual  course starting from the “good fortune” (bhága) desired to be acquired in 10d and  amplified in the first half of verse 11 to a pun on the god’s name Bhaga, with a rich  set of images, a clashing set of objects to the verb “hold fast,” and a covert syntactic  transformation of that very verb at the end of the verse.  
All in all, a tour de force of virtuosity.
