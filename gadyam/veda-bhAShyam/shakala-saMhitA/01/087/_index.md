Maruts  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
6 verses: jagatī  
The gleeful density of descriptive adjectives in verse 1 opens this hymn with a bang.  It is only in the final pāda of this first verse that we encounter a verb—and its  

subject is explicitly left unspecified (“whoever they are”). On the one hand, they  need not be named, as the descriptions are enough to identify them as Maruts; on  the other hand, it is frequently stated that individual Maruts can’t be told apart.  The next two verses (2–3) are more dynamic, depicting the Maruts’ usual wild jour  
ney, with its thunder, lightning, and rain.  
The first half of verse 4 returns to the style of verse 1, with a torrent of adjectives,  this time applied not to the plural Maruts, but to the singular “flock” (gaṇá). The  second half of this verse opens with the 2nd sg. verb “you are.” Although most inter preters take this as an address to the Marut flock, with a shift of person—and this  would be the default reading—we believe something more tricky is going on. The  patronymic of our poet Gotama is Rāhūgaṇa, whose second element is this word  “flock.” On the basis of this shared verbal designation, Gotama seems to be address ing himself and identifying himself with the Maruts, particularly as the “furtherer  of this insight,” that is, as a producer of sacral poetry arising from inner insight. (He  may call himself a requiter of debts because he pays with his verbal labor for the  benefits given by both gods and patrons.) He clarifies this identification in the fol lowing verse (5). We are poets because of our kinship with our ancestral father, that  is, the Marut flock (pāda a). As with them, our speech (“tongue”) is inspired by the  vision (“eye”) produced by soma (pāda b), and we aspire to emulate the Maruts, who  chanted to Indra to encourage him in the Vr̥tra battle and acquired a share in the  sacrifice (pādas cd). (The relationship between Gotama Rāhūgaṇa, the Maruts, and  verbal inspiration is explored even more elaborately in the following hymn, I.88.) The hymn ends (vs. 6) with a more conventional depiction of the Maruts.
