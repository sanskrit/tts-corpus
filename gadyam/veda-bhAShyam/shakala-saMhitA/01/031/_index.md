Agni  
Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa  
18 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8, 16, 18  
A rigid verse-initial sequence provides an obvious skeletal structure for this  hymn: each of the first fifteen verses opens with tvám agne “you, o Agni” (or minor  variants thereupon). The remaining three verses (16–18) maintain the second-posi tion vocative agne, but place other items in first position—a typical loosening of  structure toward the end of a hymn.  
Superimposed on this strict repetition is a less insistent structure of thematic  ring composition. The opening of the hymn (vss. 1–4) treats the primal installa tion of Agni in the sacrifice, a theme reinforced by the word prathamáḥ “first” sta tioned after the first two words in verses 1–3. Demigods and legendary ancestral  mortals are named in these verses, and some of them return in verse 17, the last  verse before the summary verse (18), in which Agni is explicitly urged to perform  the same actions for us as he did for them in earlier times. In between is the ritual  here-and-now. Verses 5–8 detail the aid that Agni gives to a devoted priest in the  ritual. In verses 9–11 Agni’s relationship to his worshiper is depicted more expan sively: he is a father to us with all of a father’s care, but, in a paradox much loved  by Vedic bards, Agni is also a son, both of the kindling sticks (vs. 9) and of the  priests who wield those sticks (vs. 11). Verse 11 connects the primal creation of Agni  treated at the beginning of the hymn with the current ritual, in which Agni is the son  of “a father as trifling as me.”  
The remainder of the hymn (esp. vss. 12–15) begs for Agni’s protection for the  sacrificer and his group, and continues the themes both of Agni’s paternal care (vss.  

14, 16) and the weakness and unworthiness of those he cares for (vss. 13–14). The  poet cleverly uses this acknowledged weakness to his advantage by asking Agni to  forgive and forget what we have done wrong in the ritual (vs. 16). There follows the  ring-compositional reminiscence of Agni’s primal installation (vs. 17). As often, the  final verse (18) is somewhat extra-hymnic, in that it sums up the hymn that precedes  with an introductory formula, eténa...bráhmaṇā “through this sacred formula  
tion,” designed to simulate Agni’s favor.

Agni This is the first of five hymns attributed to Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa and the only one addressed to Agni. It is noteworthy that the hymn begins and ends with references to the Aṅgirases: 1a (agne ...) áṅgirā ṛ́ṣiḥ, 2a (agne ...) áṅgirastamaḥ and 17a (the last vs. before the extra-hymnic summary vs.) (agne) aṅgirasvád aṅgiraḥ, a reference to his parentage and a word that often plays off its phonological similarity to agní- (cf. RV I.1), a voc. of which occurs in every vs. in this hymn.

I.31.1-2: Some reciprocal vocabulary: in 1c the kavis (the Maruts) are born under the vrata of Agni, while in 2b Agni as kavi tends to the vrata of the gods.
