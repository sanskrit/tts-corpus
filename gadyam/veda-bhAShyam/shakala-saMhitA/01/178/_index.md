178  
Indra  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
One might fancifully suggest that all the difficulties that were stripped out of the  immediately preceding hymn (I.177) to produce that elementary composition have  

been piled into this one, which has a number of intractable problems in grammar  (see especially the plural verb with apparent dual subject in verse 2b) and interpre tation. Nonetheless, the overall intent of the hymn is clear.  
In the first two verses the poet asserts the usual relationship between mortal  praise and divine aid. Indra gives his attention to the current poet as he did to  previous ones, it is hoped, and therefore should fulfill our desire. The content of  this desire is expressed in an obscure phrase, “all things around the waters of Āyu,”  which has been explained by Paul Thieme (1949: 41 n. 2) as the territories that can  be inhabited by men because water is available. Verse 2 more or less repeats the  sentiments: Indra will surely not deprive us, and he will surely come to our sacrifice.  The question is what Indra will not deprive us of: the grammatical difficulties of  pāda b alluded to above add to the interpretational puzzle. If the two sisters here  are Night and Dawn, as most scholars believe, it is presumably whatever these two  temporal entities (treated as plural, not dual, because they consist of many days  and nights?) produce in the progress of time. The sisters could also be the two hands  (treated as plural because each consists of five fingers). The waters make another  appearance in this verse, with no more clarity than in verse 1.  
The next verse (3), which is the center of the hymn, predicates of Indra (in agent  nouns difficult to render literally) an array of roles in which he gives aid to mortals,  and the final two verses (4–5), beginning with a summary evā́ “even so, in the same  way,” urge Indra to fulfill some of these roles.
