‘प्र वः पान्तम्' इति षडृचं षोडश सूक्तं दैर्घतमसं जागतम् । पूर्वत्र वैष्णवं हि' इत्युक्तत्वात् वैष्णवम् । आद्यस्तृच इन्द्रदेवताकश्च । प्र वो जागतं त्वैन्द्रश्चाद्यस्तृचः' इत्यनुक्रमणिका। आभिप्लविकेषूक्थ्येषु स्तोमातिशंसने उक्तो विनियोगः ॥

155  
Viṣṇu and Indra (1–3), Viṣṇu (4–6)  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
6 verses: jagatī  
This hymn starts by praising Indra and Viṣṇu jointly (vss. 1–2), but by verse 3 (pace  the Anukramaṇī) it is entirely Viṣṇu’s. The beginning seems to offer alternative sce narios for the creation of the wide space that is ordinarily attributed to Viṣṇu’s  three strides. In verse 1 the two gods standing on the back of the mountains seem  to enlarge the space, and in verse 2 their clash (presumably with unnamed enemies)  creates breathing room, while they also deflect the arrow of the archer Kr̥śānu,  whose presence here is not explained. (Kr̥śānu is best known as the archer who  
shoots at the falcon that steals the soma from heaven; cf. IV.27.3, IX.77.2.) The first half of verse 3 showcases two contrastive pairs: unspecified females  (possibly hymns?) who strengthen his masculine nature, and (by implication) a son  who induces his two mothers (Heaven and Earth?) to enjoy the semen. The para doxical quality of these actions is clear, but the exact contents are not. The second  half of the verse introduces the “three” so characteristic of Viṣṇu, though used of  names, not strides; nonetheless, the same expansion of space, into highest heaven,  seems to be at issue. Verse 4 seems almost like a “repair” of verse 3: it is clear in 4a  who is tending to “his great masculine nature” (unlike 3a), and in the second half  we have the familiar three strides, not three names. Verse 5 continues the theme of  the three strides, while a different numerological topic, the year, closes the hymn  (vs. 6).  
The paired verses 3 and 4, with their mysteries and paradoxes, appear to consti tute an omphalos.
