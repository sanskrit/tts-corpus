‘ उदु त्यम्' इति त्रयोदशर्चं सप्तमं सूक्तं प्रस्कण्वस्यार्षं सूर्यदेवत्यम् । आदौ नव गायत्र्यः शिष्टाश्चतस्रोऽनुष्टुभ इत्युक्तम् । तथा चानुक्रान्तम् - उदु त्यं सप्तोना सौर्य नवाद्या गायत्र्यः' इति। आश्विनशस्त्रे सौर्ये क्रतौ  ‘ उदु त्यम्' इत्यादयो नवर्चः शंसनीयाः ।  ‘ संस्थितेष्वाश्विनाय' इति खण्डे सूत्रितं - सूर्यो नो दिव उदु त्यं जातवेदसमिति नव' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ६. ५) इति ॥

Sūrya (1-9), and a Spell against Disease (10–13)  
Praskaṇva Kāṇva  
13 verses: gāyatrī 1–9, anuṣṭubh 10–13  
This final hymn of the Praskaṇva sequence falls into two parts. The last three  verses (11–13) have a clear Atharvan cast, as a spell against disease, specifically  jaundice. By sympathetic magic, the golden sun removes the jaundice from the  afflicted man and displaces it onto other, presumably yellowish creatures—parrots  and other birds.  
The first nine verses, in a different meter, are a charmingly simple descrip tion of the rising of the Sun and the beginning of his journey across the sky.  The affinity of the intermediate verse (10) is not clear. Though it matches the  meter of the final three verses, in tone it seems more like a final verse summariz ing the happy result of the sunrise in verses 1–9. (It is not unusual for the final  verse of a hymn to be in a different meter from the rest.) If this is the case, then  the spell in verses 11–13 could have been tacked onto this hymn because of the  phrase “higher heaven” (11b), which echoes “higher light” and “highest light” in  verse 10.

Sūrya Although this is the last hymn in the Praskaṇva group (I.44-50), it does not belong directly with the preceding hymns, which are clearly grouped in pairs and belong to the Prātaranuvāka litany.
