Mitra and Varuṇa  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The nub of this hymn may be found in verse 5c, “(Though it cannot be) compre hended, the youths enjoy the formulation,” and the poet almost seems to be recom mending this course of action to us, the audience:  to enjoy poetic formulations  whether we understand them or not. The hymn provides a number of examples on  which to test this advice.  
The power of formulated truth and the frequent opacity of its verbal form are  both treated early in the hymn. In the first verses the poet affirms the close associa tion of Mitra and Varuṇa with truth and their power to defeat untruth (see 1cd, also  indirectly 3d), while in both 2a and 3b he questions the ability of ordinary people to  comprehend. The object of the comprehension is left undefined (“this,” 2a; “that,”  3b), but in our opinion it is the formulation, or the “truth,” or the speech of the  gods and/or poets. He then implies that whether or not we comprehend is immate rial, for mantras proclaimed by poets come true (2b) regardless of whether or not  they were understood by their hearers.  
Verse 3 seems to contain a few test formulations (3a, 3c) and comments on them  (3b, 3d). The formulations are constructed as paradoxes: the footless one who is  first of the footed (3a); the embryo who carries its own burden, contravening the  usual expectation that the embryo is the burden that the mother bears (see, e.g.,  III.46.5, VI.67.4, X.27.16). The next three verses (4–6) concern the familiar myster  
ies of the ritual day: the rising of the sun following the dawns (vss. 4–5) and the  flaring up of the fire fueled by streams of melted butter (vs. 6). These predictable  daily occurrences are implicitly identified as conforming to “the ordinance of Mitra  and Varuṇa” (vss. 4d, 5d).  
The final verse is a simple invitation to the sacrifice with prayers for the  gods’ aid.
