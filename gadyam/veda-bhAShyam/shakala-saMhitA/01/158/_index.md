Aśvins  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
6 verses: triṣṭubh 1–5, anuṣṭubh 6  
This is an elusive hymn, but a particularly interesting one since it appears to be auto biographical—although whether it refers to the actual life of the poet or to the life  of the poet as his own literary creation is not entirely clear. The best starting point  may be the final verse, in which the poet describes himself as old, but nevertheless as  the “chariot-driver” of the waters and a “formulator (of the truth).” He is still a poet  and a powerful one at that. The problem the hymn addresses, therefore, could be an  attempt by the poet’s patrons or fellow poets to retire him, and therefore he calls upon  the Aśvins to help him show his mettle as a poet. One of the wondrous acts of the  Aśvins is to rejuvenate, and therefore it is not surprising that he would turn to them.  
Even if this is the right approach to the hymn, a fair number of difficulties  remain. In verse 2 the poet asks who will serve the Aśvins, if not he, so that the  two gods will take their place “in the track of the cow.” As often elsewhere, the  cow is the inspired hymn, and therefore the “track of the cow” should be the  place of the sacrifice, where the inspired hymn is recited. In praising the Aśvins  

the poet alludes to the two gods’ great deeds of rescue, which turn on the theme  of water. In verse 3 the poet mentions the story of Bhujyu, who was rescued from  the water by the Aśvins. In verse 5 is the story of a man whom Dāsas bound and  tossed into the rivers. The story is unknown, but presumably that person was also  rescued from the waters. These rescues anticipate the poet’s final claim in verse  6 to be the master of the waters. The significance of this is not clear, but it may  mean that he can bring the rain through the power of his recitations and rituals.  These stories of drowning, of too much water, also contrast to the poet’s plea  in verse 4 not to be dried out by time and not to be burnt up, as if he were like  kindling. Despite his age the poet is and wishes to remain vital, not to become a  dried-out old stick of a man.  
The Br̥haddevatā (IV.21–25) presents the story or stories mentioned in verse 5 as  the story of Dīrghatamas himself. According to it, his slaves (dāsas) tied up the old,  blind Dīrghatamas and immersed him in the waters of the river. One of them, called  Traitana, tried to strike him with sword, but ended up cutting to pieces his own  head, shoulders, and chest. Eventually Dīrghatamas washed up near the country  of the Aṅgas, where he was rescued. Later he had a son, Kakṣīvant, by a servant of  the king. It is unlikely that this is the story known to the R̥gveda or even that verse  5 tells the story of Dīrghatamas, unless metaphorically. Still, the reference to the  Dāsas seems to be of particular significance. The earlier part of the hymn develops  a repetitive phonological pattern with daśasyátam (1b), dásrā (1c), dāśat (2a), and  dáśatayaḥ (4c). These words, most of which have a marked position in the pāda,  seem to lead toward the story of the Dāsas. These Dāsas did try to destroy someone  but ended up destroying themselves, and perhaps this is the message that the poet  wishes to impress upon those who are trying to push him aside.
