Indra and Agni  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Dedicated to Indra and Agni like the preceding hymn, this one takes a livelier and  less predictable course, characterized by a 1st-person voice. This voice announces  in the first two verses that he seeks a better state and must turn to Indra and Agni  for help because his kin-group is unreliable. This is expressed in general terms in  the first verse, but in bitter particulars in the second. Interestingly the deficient rela  
tives in that verse are both connections through the female line: his daughter’s hus band and his wife’s brother (the word syālá is specialized for this relationship). In a  patrilocal system like that of ancient India, neither of them would have particularly  close ties to him.  
The theme of kinship is continued in verse 3, where the forefathers, a more  satisfactory set of relatives, provide the model for the performance of a soma  sacrifice for Indra and Agni, the success of which seems to have been in doubt  (see 3a). This soma sacrifice continues in verse 4, where the Aśvins, somewhat  surprisingly, participate in its performance. Perhaps the idea is that even other  gods, the Aśvins and the goddess Holy Place, do ritual service to the great Indra  and Agni.  
The subject gradually shifts to praise of the two gods’ powers (vss. 5–6) and  requests for their aid (vss. 7–8). In verse 7 the forefathers return, and the poet,  rather indirectly, compares the sacrificial compact the gods had with these ances tors with the one he hopes he has established now.
