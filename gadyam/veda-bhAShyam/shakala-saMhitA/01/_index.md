The first maṇḍala of the R̥gveda is also, in part, one of its later additions, as was  discussed in detail in the general introduction. Like Maṇḍala X, it consists of 191  hymns, which belong to two different strata of the text. 

### Section 1-50  
The first fifty hymns, attributed to six different groups of poets, constitute the later stratum. They are primarily  in dimeter meter, sometimes arranged in tr̥cas, and the Kaṇva affiliation of a number of the poets connects this section with Maṇḍala VIII.  

- 1–11 Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra (etc.)  
- 12–23 Medhātithi Kāṇva  
- 24–30 Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti  
- 31–35 Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa  
- 36–43 Kaṇva Ghaura  
- 44–50 Praskaṇva Kāṇva  

For the most part the poetry is not particularly inspired and has a narrow liturgical  focus, especially in the first few collections. The major exception is the brief series  attributed to Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa, all in trimeter meter. This sequence contains  one of the most famous hymns in the R̥gveda, I.32, the clearest treatment of the  Indra-Vr̥tra myth and a poetic masterwork, as well as I.33, less celebrated but displaying equal poetic skill.+++(5)+++

### Section 51-191  
The second and far longer part of Maṇḍala I (51–191) consists of hymns attributed to nine groups of poets:  

- 51–57 Savya Āṅgirasa  
- 58–64 Nodhas Gautama  
- 65–73 Parāśara Śāktya  
- 74–93 Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
- 94–115 Kutsa Āṅgirasa (etc.)  
- 116–126 Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa  
- 127–139 Paruchepa Daivodāsi  
- 140–164 Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
- 165–191 Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  

A number of these poets have quite distinctive stylistic personalities and thematic  preoccupations, and their collections contain some of the most glorious poetry in  the R̥gveda. Some of the hymns are quite famous (e.g., I.164, the “riddle hymn”; I.179, the dialogue between the seer Agastya and his impatiently amorous wife  Lopāmudrā), but there are many treasures to be unearthed among the lesser known  hymns.+++(5)+++ We refer the reader to the introductions to the various hymn collections and  their individual hymns.  

### Beginning hymns  
The first ten hymns of the R̥gveda are attributed to Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra, with  I.11 ascribed to his son or descendant Jetar Mādhuchandasa. After the opening hymn  to Agni and two hymns (2–3) to the deities of the Praügaśastra litany, the remainder  of the hymns are addressed to Indra, most of them relatively simple and without  notable features.  

It is of course appropriate that the whole R̥gveda collection should begin with a  hymn to the deified ritual fire as the focal point of the sacrificial system. This hymn  in its relative simplicity and its clear exposition of Agni’s ritual role seems almost to  have been chosen for this prominent position for pedagogical purposes.+++(4)+++ It certainly  continues to serve such purposes in the modern West, where it is generally the first  hymn a student of the R̥gveda encounters and from which the mysteries of Vedic  Sanskrit grammar—accents, subjunctives, unexpected long vowels, variant nominal  forms, and so on—and of Vedic ritual are absorbed. It is therefore not surprising  that it is often assumed to be typical of R̥gvedic Agni hymns, but this is emphatically not the case: elsewhere in the R̥gveda Agni hymns often display especially contorted syntax and complex imagery and glory in enigma and paradox. The choice  of this particular Agni hymn to open the R̥gveda thus seems even more purposeful  against the background of more standard treatments of Agni.  

### Hymns 12–23  
12–23 are attributed to Medhātithi Kāṇva, also supposedly the poet of some  verses in the early hymns of Maṇḍala VIII, a predominately Kāṇva book, as well  as the second hymn of the Soma Maṇḍala (IX.2). The Medhātithi First Maṇḍala  hymns here are all in gāyatrī meter, save for some stray verses in I.17 and 23. They  are dedicated to a variety of deities; in fact, each hymn has a different divinity or  set of divinities. The poet has a particular penchant for dedicands in pairs (Indra  and Varuṇa I.17, Agni and the Maruts I.19, Indra and Agni I.21) or groups (Viśve  Devāḥ I.14, R̥bhus I.20, variety of divinities I.13, 15, 22–23), and in the group  hymns a high proportion follow particular ritual litanies: Āprī (I.13), R̥tugrahas  (I.15), Praügaśastra (I.23).  

### Ritual focus  
The style and contents of these hymns are for the most part elementary, even  banal, and there is generally a strong focus on purely ritual matters, to the virtual  exclusion of description, mythological references, praise, and even requests for aid  and gifts. In short, a poetically uninspiring collection, but the information it gives  about the early shape of later ritual litanies is valuable.
