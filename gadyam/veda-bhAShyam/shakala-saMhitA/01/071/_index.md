71  
Agni  
Parāśara Śāktya  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  

The first of the Parāśara hymns in triṣṭubh, this is a curiously structured and very  difficult hymn. It begins with a sexually suggestive verse describing the kindling of 194 I.71 the ritual fire by the fingers of the officiant manipulating the kindling sticks. 

Verse 2  switches to the mythic past and a fairly standard and straightforward summary of  the role of the Aṅgirases in the opening of the Vala cave, but nothing in the hymn  is straightforward after this. Verses treating the here-and-now of the ritual alternate  with snippets of mythology.  

The most dramatic mythological material is found discontinuously in verses 5  and 8, which treat the well-known if ill-understood story of the incest between  Heaven and his daughter (see also X.61.5–7, as well as Jamison 1991:  288–301)  and especially the punishment meted out to the offender by his avenger, who is  clearly Agni. Since the birth of the Aṅgirases resulted from this incest, this myth fits  both the dedicand of the hymn and the Aṅgiras verse (2) that follows the opening,  and even the sexual innuendo of verse 1 may have evoked, or been evoked by, the  incest theme.  

The other mythological allusion is to Mātariśvan’s stealing of fire (vs. 4); it  is not clear whether this reference is meant to have any points of contact with  the other mythological portions of the hymn. It does, however, connect with  the theme of the interaction between gods and men, especially with Agni as  go-between, found in verses 3, 4, and 7. Another puzzle is why Mitra and Varuṇa  intrude into this Agni hymn in verse 9, though the appearance of the Sun in  that same verse takes us back to verse 2. Ritual concerns are the focus of vss. 3,  6, and 7.  

In short, in terms of structure this hymn neither follows a point-to-point trajectory nor displays an omphalos/ring-compositional shape. Instead it seems  to show, at least in its central sections, sets of interlocking, overlapping paired  verses—3 + 6, 4 + 7, 5 + 8—loosely nestled within a ring consisting of 2 + 9, and  perhaps, more loosely still, 1 + 10.
