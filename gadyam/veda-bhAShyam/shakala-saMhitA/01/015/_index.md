R̥tudevatāḥ (Sequential Deities)  
Medhātithi Kāṇva  
12 verses: gāyatrī  
This hymn has a precise ritual application: it accompanies a series of ritual offer ings (R̥tugrahas “sequential cups”) made in a fixed order to a fixed sequence of  gods by a similarly fixed sequence of priests, roughly matched in function to  the gods they serve. (See, e.g., Eggeling Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2: 319 n. 1.) The same sequence is found in the two hymns II.36–37, which together are entirely  parallel to this hymn. (See further remarks in the introductions to those hymns.)  The divine order and the priestly counterparts are the following. (The priests  are not all mentioned by title in this hymn, but those not bracketed are found in  II.36–37.)

Sequential deities (for the ṛtugrahas) Although this hymn is in some ways a rote and formulaic listing of the Ṛtugraha deities with invitations to drink of their respective cups, the poet does inject some life in the hymn by varying the expected phraseology. After having established the formula DRINK ṛtúnā in the first few verses, the poet introduces deviations from that formula. In vs. 5 he urges Indra to drink not from the Brahman’s cup (as would be standard: see II.36.5), but from the Brahman’s “largesse” (rā́dhasaḥ) and ṛtū́m̐ ánu substitutes for ṛtúnā (note the phonological crossing of únā: ánu). In vs. 6 there is no invitation to drink, though ṛtúnā is found in another expression. In vs. 7 the expected deity (“Wealth-giver”) appears in the nominative (draviṇodā́(ḥ)) as expected, but there is no attached predicate: the verse goes off in a different direction.

The Wealth-giver is the subject of the next three verses (8-10) as well, but it is only in vs. 9 that any drinking goes on. Here the imperative “drink!” is replaced by the desiderative “desires to drink” (pipīṣati), and though there is an ablative of a priestly cup, it is one belonging to a different priest and the verb used with it is not ‘drink’.

Although this is not high art, it does show that even the most cut-and-dried litany affords some room to tinker with the verbal form.
