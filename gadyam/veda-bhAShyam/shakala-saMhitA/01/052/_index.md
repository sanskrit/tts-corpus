‘त्यं सु मेषम् ' इति पञ्चदशर्चं द्वितीयं सूक्तं सव्यस्यार्षमैन्द्रम् । त्रयोदशी पञ्चदशी त्रिष्टुभौ शिष्टा जगत्यः । तथा चानुक्रान्तं- ‘ त्यं सु त्रयोदश्यन्त्ये त्रिष्टुभौ ' इति । गवामयनस्य मध्यमेऽहनि विषुवत्संज्ञके मरुत्वतीयशस्त्रे इदं सूक्तम् । विषुवान्दिवाकीर्त्यः' इति खण्डे सूत्रितं- त्यं सु मेषं कया शुभेति च मरुत्वतीयम्' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ८. ६ ) इति ॥

52  
Indra  
Savya Āṅgirasa  
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 13, 15  
This hymn begins in the same way as the previous one, by praising Indra in the  form of a ram, but, unlike I.51 with its listing of Indra’s great deeds, I.52 focuses  almost entirely on the Vr̥tra myth and its aftermath—save for a brief reference to  the Vala myth in verse 5 (and possibly verse 3). The account of the Vr̥tra battle  begins in verse 2 and continues through verse 10, with a reiteration in the final verse  15, and thus constitutes one of the longer sustained R̥gvedic passages devoted to  this myth. This account of the myth has not achieved the fame of a hymn like I.32,  however—in part because of the obscurity of its diction and syntax.  
This version also allots a large role to the helpers that encouraged and aided  Indra at the battle, not only Tvaṣṭar (vs. 7) as often, but also the Maruts, iden tified as such in verses 9 and 15 (see also vs. 3), but also referred to as per sonified abstractions—“forms of help” (see vss. 2, 4–5, 9), “powers,” et cetera.  Almost paradoxically the hymn also depicts the fear of the divine beings and  of heaven itself during the Vr̥tra battle (vss. 9–10). Moreover, the final verses  (11–14, excluding the summarizing verse 15) concern the extent of Indra’s unri valed power, comparing its reach to the furthest expanses of heaven, earth, and  the midspace.
