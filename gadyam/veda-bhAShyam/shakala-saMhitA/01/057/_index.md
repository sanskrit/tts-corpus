'प्र मंहिष्ठाय ' इति षड़ृचं सप्तमं सूक्तं सव्यस्यार्षमैन्द्रं जागतम् । तथा चानुक्रान्तं - ‘ प्र मंहिष्ठाय' इति । विषुवति निष्केवल्ये इदं सूक्तं शंसनीयम् । सूत्रितं च – 'प्र मंहिष्ठाय त्यमू ष्वितीह तार्क्ष्यमन्ततः' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ८. ६) इति । उक्थ्यसंस्थे क्रतौ तृतीयसवने ब्राह्मणाच्छंसिशस्त्रेऽपि एतत्सूक्तम् । सूत्रितं -- सर्वाः ककुभः प्र मंहिष्ठायोदप्रुतः ' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ६. १) इति ॥

Indra  
Savya Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: jagatī  
This final hymn of the Savya group turns its attention from the recounting of  Indra’s great (and lesser) deeds to focus on the ritual performance being offered  to honor the god (vss. 1–3) and on the participants in that performance: “we” who  are “yours,” that is, Indra’s (vss. 4–5). Only in the final verse (6) is there mention of  any of Indra’s exploits, with an oblique reference to the Vr̥tra myth that is featured  heavily in other Savya hymns.  
One of the puzzles of the hymn is the identity of the female addressee in verse 3,  “(you,) lovely like Dawn.” Oldenberg (tentatively), Geldner, and Renou all suggest  that she is the Sacrificer’s Wife, but this is quite unlikely. As I have argued elsewhere  (Jamison 2011, forthcoming a, forthcoming b), this ritual participant is only being  introduced in the late R̥gveda and she is a controversial and polarizing figure there,  so it is improbable that she would be addressed without fanfare here. Moreover, the  addressee is called upon to bring or assemble material for the sacrifice, a role that  the Sacrificer’s Wife never has in classical śrauta ritual (see Jamison 1996a passim).
