Pūsaṇ  
Kaṇva Ghaura  
10 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas, with a final verse  
Like other Pūṣan hymns, this one has an informal tone and imaginative depictions of  the circumstances in which Pūṣan can render us aid. In the first part of the hymn the  god is asked to rid our paths of potential enemies (esp. vss. 2–4), while in the latter part  he is to lead us along these roads, now rendered safe, to prosperity (esp. vss. 7–8). The  nine verses of tr̥cas are consistently addressed to Pūṣan in the 2nd person, and all those  verses but 5 contain imperatives; note especially the final explosion of five abrupt,  object-less imperatives in 9ab, the final verse of the hymn proper. In the final summary  verse (10) Pūṣan is in the 3rd person, the object of our attentions and our requests.
