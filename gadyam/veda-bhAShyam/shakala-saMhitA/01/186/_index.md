All Gods  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
Although this hymn provides numerous small difficulties and twists of phrase char acteristic of Agastya, its basic outline is very simple: god after god is urged to come  to our sacrifice, beginning with Savitar (vs. 1) and ending with the gods collectively  (vs. 10d), and working through a list of divinities both major (e.g., the Ādityas [vs. 2],  Indra [vss. 6cd–7], the Maruts [vss. 8–9]) and minor (e.g., Ahi Budhnya [vs. 5]), in no  apparent order. There is much emphasis on shared activity, with expressions like “in  concert” (sajóṣas vss. 2–3, 6), “along with” (smát vss. 6–8), “like-minded” (sámanas vs. 8). The invitations end with verse 10; as so often, the final verse (11) is an internal  reference to the hymn itself and its power to satisfy the gods.  
The beginnings of the verses and half-verses display an intricate pattern of rep etition that cannot be rendered in translation: with matching preverbs in verses 1–2  and 9–10 (the latter showing an especially complex phonological pattern), and the  verses of the middle section (5–8) all opening with utá “and” (as well as additional  matching material). The “and” especially contributes to our sense of the additive  quality of the invitations to the gods.

All Gods As noted in the published introduction, the hymn is knit together by a shifting pattern of repeated initial preverbs and particles: 1a / 2a ā́(with ápi 1c), úpa 4a, which morphs into utá 5a, 6a, 7a, 8a -- the last 3 with utá na īm -- followed by prá 9a, 9b, 10a, 10b (which was anticipated by pṛ́... 8c. For the prá-s note 9a prá nú, 9b prá yu(...), 10 prá ū, 10b pra pū(...). Vs. 11 falls outside the picture. The repeated utá-s of vss. 5-8 reinforce the frequent additive quality of Viśve Devāḥ hymns.
