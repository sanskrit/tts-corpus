103  
Indra  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Like I.102, this hymn begins with a difficult verse, treating the two aspects of  Indra’s power, situated on earth and in heaven respectively. We can assume that  the earthbound power has to do with the aid he provides to mortals in battle,  while his heavenly power is displayed by his cosmogonic deeds. The poet claims  the two types of power are mixed together equally and the result serves as a sort  of beacon, an odd image—but the underlying notion must be that of the light  (of Dawn, of Agni) that connects heaven and earth, frequently referred to as a  beacon. Similarly Indra’s twin powers link the heavenly and earthly realms and are  conspicuous in both.244 I.103  
Both types of power are treated in the hymn, which has an omphalos struc ture. The cosmogonic deeds are found in the outer frame, verses 2 and 7 (and  8ab), particularly the slaying of Vr̥tra. The inner verses (3–6) concern Indra’s  involvement with us, the Āryas, as we confront our traditional foes, the Dāsas  and the Dasyus, who do not share in the values of the Ārya community. The  omphalos itself consists of verse 4, where Indra acquires several names mark ing his successful progress. The following verse (5)  presents itself as a sort of  epiphany: the people are exhorted to behold the results of Indra’s actions and  therefore believe in his existence. The omphalos structure is marked not only  thematically but verbally. Note the two occurrences of śrád-dhā “trust” in the  inner ring of verses 3 and 5.  
The responsion in the outer ring (specifically vss. 2 and 7)  is more complex  and more interesting. Verse 2c begins with the signature formula of the Vr̥tra  saga: áhann áhim “he slew the serpent,” and 7b ends with the word áhim “serpent.”  The phrase in verse 2 lacks the frequent accompaniment, the weapon (vájra) in  the instrumental “with his mace,” while 7b has vájreṇa. But on the surface the  action in that verse is entirely different:  “he woke the sleeping serpent with his  mace.” As argued elsewhere (Jamison 1982/83 and 2007: 110–12), this is a formal  “pun,” which means exactly the opposite of its surface sense. Indra did not nudge  the snake with his weapon to wake him up to fight. Instead the poet combines  the formal causative shape of the verb “awaken” (lit., “cause to awaken”) with  the semantics of its object “sleeping (serpent),” to produce an underlying form  “cause (the serpent) to sleep.” In Vedic, as in English, “cause to sleep / put to  sleep” is a euphemism for “kill,” and “waken the sleeping serpent with the mace”  is simply a particularly clever way to say “slew the serpent.” Since this phrase is  anticipated by the standard áhann áhim expression, which is in the structurally  responsive position in the ring, an alert audience would have no trouble catching  this deep-structure pun.
