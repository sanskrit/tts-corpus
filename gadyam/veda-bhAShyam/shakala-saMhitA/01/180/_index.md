Aśvins  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
Agastya’s trickery and virtuosic obscurity are fully on display in this hymn. As  a consequence we are uncertain about the correctness of many details of our  interpretation, but puzzling out the hymn provides an exhilarating ride—per haps appropriately, since the hymn begins and ends with the Aśvins’ chariot-drive  around the cosmic spaces. This ring composition is signaled by the responsions  between verses 1 and 10: the chariot “flies around” the airy realms and the (cosmic)  floods in 1ab and “speeds around” heaven in 10c (a parallel with a clever twist in  the Sanskrit, where the verb “flies” [dī́yat] is a close phonological match with the word for “heaven” [dyā́m]), and a physical feature of the chariot, its wheel-rims or  fellies, is mentioned in both verses, but with different words (paví 1c, -nemi 10c).  This ring composition provides a structure in which both the Aśvins’ journey to  and participation in the sacrifice and the poet’s exploration of the boundaries of  language can be anchored.  
In our view the flying journey begun in verse 1 brings the Aśvins to the sacrifi cial ground and its ritual fire in verse 2, a fire that is itself characterized as having  “wide flight,” that is, as physically spreading out and up when kindled. The next  two verses depict several of the Aśvins’ earlier deeds as creating a reciprocal benefit  for them at the current sacrifice. Verse 3 notes that they (primordially) put the milk  in cows, a fact of nature that is often marveled at in the R̥gveda—that a “cooked”  (that is, ready to consume) substance, milk, is derived from its container, the “raw”  flesh of the living cow. Now this same milk is going into cups to provide the Aśvins’  oblation. Similarly, in verse 4 the sweet gharma drink that they produced for the  mythological figure Atri comes back to them at this sacrifice. Both of these verses,  particularly 3, bristle with difficulties.  
With verse 5 the poet turns to his own situation and, in subsequent verses, that  of his fellow singers and their patrons. In 5 he presents himself, in the 1st person sin gular, as a poor man beset with difficulties, expressing the hope that with his praise  he can bring the Aśvins to his sacrifice and induce them to make gifts. Verse 6 has as  its subject the poet’s patron, depicted in two punning verbs (6c) as actively involved  in the sacrifice; the poet here (6d) hopes that this patron will act in good faith and  according to his proper duty by receiving the Aśvins’ gifts and then redistributing  them to the poet and his fellows. Verses 7 and 8 present a series of interlocking  causal clauses with shifting subjects. In 7ab because “we singers” do our job of  praising the gods, our patron is not stingy. “We singers” (of 7ab) in the 1st person  plural transform into Agastya in the 3rd person singular (8cd) via a set of clauses in  which the human half of the divine/human interface is left unspecified, and indeed  other crucial grammatical information, like the verb in 8ab, is missing. In our inter  
pretation, Agastya, who is of course the poet (who appeared in the 1st person sin gular in vs. 5), is the subject of the whole of verse 8, and he is calling the Aśvins to  the Morning Pressing, the sacrifice appropriate to them, whose ritual substance, the  soma, is characterized by the difficult hapax vírudra “apart from/without Rudra/ the Rudras [=Maruts].” We believe (after a suggestion of Geldner’s) that this word  encodes a reference to Agastya’s mythological engagement with the Maruts (see  especially the dialogue hymns I.165, 170, 171) and his attempts to ensure that the  Maruts get a share in the sacrifice. Here, since the Maruts are associated with the  Midday Pressing, the offering of soma to the Aśvins in the early morning would be  made without the Maruts, despite Agastya’s loyalty to the Maruts and his general  eagerness to provide them offerings. In any case, clearly Agastya has had ritual suc cess, crowned both by widespread praise (8c) and by the possession of thousands  (presumably of cows or other livestock).  

Verses 9–10 return to the gods’ chariot journey and are relatively straightfor ward, with a particularly uncomplicated demand for horses for us and our patrons  in 9cd.
