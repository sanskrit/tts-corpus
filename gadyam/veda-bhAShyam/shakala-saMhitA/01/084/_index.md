Indra  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
20 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–6, uṣṇih 7–9, paṅkti 10–12, gāyatrī 13–15, triṣṭubh 16–18, br̥hatī 19, satobr̥hatī 20; arranged in tr̥cas 1–18, pragātha 19–20  
Coming at the end of Gotama’s Indra collection, this long and metrically com plex hymn must actually be composed of smaller hymn segments. The first eighteen  verses are arranged in tr̥cas, and it ends with a single pragātha. The contents range  from the most banal invitation to the sacrifice to elusive and allusive treatments of  little-known myths. There are a number of reminiscences of the Indra hymns pre ceding it in the Gotama collection.  
The first six verses, in anuṣṭubh meter, appear to form a unity, urging Indra to come  to the soma sacrifice in clichéd and predictable phraseology. The next tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is in  uṣṇih meter (8 8 12); the last four syllables of the third pāda are a semidetached refrain  (“Indra indeed!”), so that the verses present themselves like gāyatrī (i.e., 8 8 8). The  contrast between the good sacrificer and his unsatisfactory counterpart is the theme.  
The next tr̥ca (vss. 10–12), in paṅkti meter, is highly reminiscent of I.80, also  in paṅkti. As in that hymn the fifth pāda of each verse is a refrain syntactically  unconnected to the rest of the verse. In fact, the last six syllables of the refrain  match those of I.80, and in order to make sense of the refrain here, we must supply  the verb (“they cheer on”) from the refrain of I.80. This tr̥ca concerns the mix  
ing of milk with the pressed soma, in metaphorical terms—with the milk streams  depicted as buffalo-cows. Beneath this first metaphor there may be a second: it is  possible that the Maruts lurk behind the buffalo-cow facade. (Remember that the  Maruts were one of the possible subjects of the refrain in I.80.) An association of  the Maruts with “the ritual midpoint” here might allude to their recent incorpora  
tion as recipients of the oblation at the Midday Pressing.  
Another reminiscence of I.80 is found in the next tr̥ca (vss. 13–15), in gāyatrī,  which treats in most condensed and puzzling fashion the myth of Dadhyañc  and the horse’s head. (For this myth in general, see Macdonell 1897:  141–42.)  Dadhyañc and his father Atharvan were mentioned in passing in the last verse of  I.80 (vs. 16). In other versions of the myth Dadhyañc substitutes a horse’s head  for his own in order to declare the secret location of Tvaṣṭar’s soma. In these three  short verses we find Dadhyañc, the horse’s head, and Tvaṣṭar, but the narrative  in which they are involved is entirely unclear and we confess ourselves mystified.  
The last tr̥ca (vss. 16–18) consists entirely of anxious questions, mostly in con nection with the sacrifice, reminiscent of the cascade of questions in other Gotama  hymns (I.75.3, 76.1, 77.1). The first verse (16) wonders who will be able to yoke  particularly ill-behaved cattle and bring them here. “Here” seems to refer to the  sacrifice, and the best guess as to the identity of the cattle is the Maruts, who are  the dedicands of Gotama’s next four hymns (I.85–88). The next verse (17) is more  confused, but the location of Indra and indeed his very existence are in question,  and a formal spokesman on behalf of mortals is sought. The questions are more clearly ritual in verse 18, ending with the sacrificer’s self-doubt about his status with  the gods he sacrifices to. The final two verses (19–20), an independent pragātha,  seem designed to quell this doubt, asserting that Indra himself, in a turn-about, will  praise the sacrificer and show him mercy, as well as offering him help and goods.  
Although no strong unity among the various pieces of this hymn is perceptible, it  does mimic in certain ways the progress of a soma sacrifice. It opens with the invita tion (vss. 1–6), made more pointed by the contrast between our well-made and deserv ing sacrifice and the behavior of ungenerous mortals (vss. 7–9). Verses 10–12 concern  the actual preparation of the soma (and also refer, in vs. 7, to the ritual midpoint).  Verses 13–15 can be seen as a mythic interlude, praising the great deeds of Indra while  he is present on the ritual ground. Verses 16–18 raise doubts about the efficacy of the  sacrifice that has been, or is being, performed—doubts somewhat allayed by the final  two verses (19–20), which end with the usual requests for benefits from the god.
