Aśvins  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 6, 8  
The hymn begins (vs. 1) by addressing the ritual participants (in the plural) and  announcing the Aśvins to them; the poet then addresses the Aśvins themselves with extravagant praise (vs. 2), but in the next verse (3) he expresses some impatience  with them: why are the gods wasting their time with a non-sacrificer? They should  destroy such people and reward us, the faithful sacrificers and poets (vss. 3–4). The  “baying hounds” of verse 4 may well be a reference to rival poets.  
Most of the remainder of the hymn (vss. 5–7) is devoted to the tale of Bhujyu,  son of Tugra, whom the Aśvins rescued with a marvelous boat (or boats) when he  was set adrift in the sea. This exploit was alluded to briefly by Agastya in I.180.5  and is treated several times in Kakṣīvant’s Aśvin hymns (esp. I.116.3–5, I.117.14–  
15) as well as elsewhere in the R̥gveda.  
The final verse (8) is a typical summary verse, referring to the poem just recited  and ending with the Agastya refrain.
