Aśvins  
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa  
25 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is a catalogue that mentions many stories in which the Aśvins came to  the rescue of those in need but that provides little detail. There is some thematic  linkage among the narratives, which in three instances occur in sets of four. So, for  example, the hymn begins with references to the Aśvins’ chariot or chariots and to  the chariot-animals in verses 1–4 and then returns to them once again not quite at  the end but toward the end, in verses 17–20. Verses 13–16 contain a set of stories  involving body parts: the hands of the Aśvins in verse 13, the mouth of the wolf  in 14, the foot of a mare in 15, and the eyes of R̥jrāśva in 16. Elsewhere the poet  repeatedly returns to references to waters or liquids (vss. 3, 5, 7, 9). Such linked  verses do not structure the hymn tightly, but they keep it from becoming merely a  list of great deeds.  
The Aśvins are closely associated with the Pravargya, originally an independent  rite that was incorporated into the classical soma ritual either during the upasad-days  that precede the soma-pressing day or on the pressing day itself. In this rite milk is  poured into a heated pot and offered to the Aśvins. This hymn explicitly refers to  the Pravargya rite in the first verse, which employs the marked verb prá vr̥ñje, which  gave the Pravargya its name. The verb describes either placing the Pravargya pot on  the fire or turning the pot to offer the milk. In the penultimate verse, the poet frames the hymn by an indirect reference to the Pravargya by describing Rebha as “having  twisted” (právr̥kta) in the water.  
Many of the deeds alluded to in this hymn are likewise mentioned in the fol lowing four Aśvin hymns (I.117–20), especially the first two, often in the same or  similar phraseology.
