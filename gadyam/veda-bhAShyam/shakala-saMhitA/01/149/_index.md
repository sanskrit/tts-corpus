‘ महः सः' इति पञ्चर्चं नवमं सूक्तं दैर्घतमसं वैराजमाग्नेयम् । ‘दशकास्त्रयो विराळेकादशका वा' (अनु. ६. ७-८) इत्युक्तलक्षणसद्भावात् । तथा चानुक्रान्तं- महः स वैराजम्' इति । विनियोगो लैङ्गिकः ॥

Agni  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
5 verses: virāj  
The name Agni is not mentioned in this short and enigmatic hymn. Especially in the  first verse and a half its application to Agni is quite uncertain; Geldner suggests that  Soma is referred to there. In our view the poet is certainly keeping the referent open  at the beginning of the hymn, but moves closer and closer to a clear identification  

of Agni as the hymn proceeds. This gradual disclosure of the subject of the hymn  replicates the way that the fire is slowly and carefully kindled and then emerges from  its hiding place, flaming up, when it catches. The kindling is cryptically depicted in  verse 2, while the burst of light and energy takes over verse 3. In the final two verses  (4–5) he is identified as Hotar, a standard role for Agni, and he is revealed as fully  grown, powerful, and a partner in the sacrifice with the mortal worshiper. Thus the  hymn reflects Dīrghatamas’s usual preoccupation with the birth of Agni, though it  is treated somewhat differently here.
