Agni  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Dīrghatamas’s usual preoccupation with the birth and growth of the ritual fire.  In verse 1 Agni is seated in the lap of his two parents, in our opinion the fire churning sticks, though they are not explicitly identified and other interpreters see  the two as cosmic entities. (See I.140.3, 141.4, 144.3–4 for other allusions to these  sticks in Dīrghatamas’s Agni hymns.) The fire grows in verse 2 and is tended in  verse 3. Unidentified duals are found in both verses; the ambiguity seems deliber ate, allowing the pair to represent both the churning sticks in the ritual realm and Night and Dawn (or Heaven and Earth) in the cosmic realm, as the diction referring  to the pair becomes closer to that used especially of Night and Dawn elsewhere.  After a somewhat enigmatic verse (4) sketching Agni’s relationship with poets, the  god is depicted as a birth-giver (using a word ordinarily appropriate only to the  female at parturition)—thus bringing his life-cycle full circle, as it were, from birth  to giving birth.
