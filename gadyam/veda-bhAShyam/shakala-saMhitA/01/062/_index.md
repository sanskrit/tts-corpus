॥ श्रीगणेशाय नमः ॥

यस्य निःश्वसितं वेदा यो वेदेभ्योऽखिलं जगत् ।

निर्ममे तमहं वन्दे विद्यातीर्थमहेश्वरम् ॥

अथ पञ्चमाध्याय आरभ्यते । प्रथमे मण्डले एकादशेऽनुवाके चत्वारि सूक्तानि गतानि । ' प्र मन्महे' इत्येतत् त्रयोदशर्चं पञ्चमं सूक्तम् । अत्रानुक्रम्यते- प्र सप्तोनेति । अनिरुक्ता संख्या विंशतिः । ( अनु. १२. ४ ) इत्युक्तत्वात् प्र सप्तोनेत्युक्ते त्रयोदशेत्युक्तं भवति ।  ‘ ऋषिश्चान्यस्मात् ' इति परिभाषया नोधा ऋषिः । अनादेशपरिभाषया त्रिष्टुप् छन्दः । इन्द्रो देवता । गतः सामान्य विनियोगः । विशेषविनियोगस्तु लिङ्गादवगन्तव्यः ॥

62  
Indra  
Nodhas Gautama  
13 verses: triṣṭubh  
The poetic ingenuity of Nodhas is also on display in this hymn, though in some what different ways from his tricks in I.61. The hymn is full of phonetic play and  alliteration, with numerous somewhat aberrant morphological forms generated  for this play. Repetition and variation on this repetition are also conspicuous—for  example, the word sanā́t (“from of old”) opening 8a, 10a, 12a, with teasingly close  forms (sánemi 9a, sánīḍā 10a) alternating with it.  
The hymn falls into two main sections. The first five verses are the more conven tional—if poetically rich—part, treating the Vala myth and especially the role of  the Aṅgirases in it. (Interestingly, the Vala myth is absent from I.61.) The first half  of verse 6 seems to summarize this deed of Indra’s extravagantly: “This is his most  conspicuous deed, the dearest wonder of the wondrous one.” But Nodhas tricks us  here, for the second half of the verse concerns an entirely different and much more  obscure deed of Indra’s, the swelling of the four, probably celestial, rivers. From 6cd  through verse 10 we meet fleetingly recounted fragments of other myths, but these  myths seem connected at a structural level, since they involve female figures in pairs  or groups working reciprocally or jointly: the rivers of 6cd, the two world-halves of 7  (compared to twin consorts), Night and Dawn (compared to young girls) in 8, black  and red cows in 9, and streams again in 10, apparently returning to the rivers of 6cd.  In the second half of 10 we encounter a surfeit of females: two words for wives (jáni and pátnī) as well as sisters, all offering friendship to Indra. These females may refer  to the streams of the first half of the verse, or to the thoughts converging on Indra  in the next verse (11), which are also compared to wives. Most likely the reference in  

10cd is double, providing a transition from the cosmic mythological realm in verses  6–10 to the ritual here-and-now of verses 11–13. The hymn ends, like I.61, with a  verse (13) specifically applicable to the “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation, and like I.61  (vss. 14 and 16) mentions both the poet Nodhas and his clan, the Gotamas.

Indra Shares much vocabulary with I.61 and sometimes plays off the turns of phrase in that hymn.
