Agni  
Parāśara Śāktya  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
Another hymn in which the overall structure and the relationships among the  parts are unclear. The dominant myth here is the gods’ search for and recov ery of Agni, who had gone missing, and his (re)establishment as the ritual fire.  This myth is treated in verses 2, 4, and 6 at least, and verses 3 and 5 are prob ably related as well. However, sorting out the narrative(s) is made difficult by the  lack of overt subjects (as Geldner already pointed out) and by the number of  injunctive verb forms, as well as some perfects that can have either presential or  preterital value. These grammatical ambiguities allow much of the hymn to be  

applicable simultaneously to the mythic past of the gods and the ritual present of  men. Other mythic references include the dog Saramā’s discovery and release of  the penned-in cattle (vs. 8), thematically parallel to the discovery and recovery of  Agni, and a puzzling reference to Aditi and her sons the Ādityas and the suckling  of a bird (vs. 9).  
What provides some unity to the hymn is less these unfinished scraps of mythical  narrative than a focus on the vocabulary of knowledge and discovery: forms of the  root vid “find, acquire, possess” and the homonymous root vid “know, discern,” as  well as the semantically related roots jñā “know, recognize” and cit “discern,” are  found, often multiply, in almost every verse. The hymn can thus be read as a sort of  meta-reflection on the process of learning.  
Another important feature of the hymn is the preoccupation with names and  bodies, rather like the later category of “name-and-form” (nāma-rūpa). Proferes  argues that verse 5 contains an early reflection of the Tānūnaptra rite, in which  the sacrificer and the officiating priests at a soma sacrifice enter into a pact to be  loyal to each other. The charter myth for this vow involves the gods all depositing  their bodies in a common place (the sun, or Indra standing for the sun) to produce  a common defense against external enemies. (See Proferes 2007: 59 for I.72.5 and  51–61 for the rite in general and its mythological background.) We agree with  his analysis, but in fact think that the theme is more prominent in the hymn than  in just that one verse. The central verses seem to suggest that the gods’ quest for  Agni and their discovery of him and his name (not overtly present, but formulai cally suggested) in verse 2 and their ritual service to him in verse 3 allow them  to acquire their own ritually worthy names and to make their own bodies also  worthy of ritual service in verse 4. This leads to the mutual exchange and mutual  possession of bodies in the Tānūnaptra verse proper (5). Thus rendered ritually  worthy, they find within Agni the intricate and secret “tracks” of the ritual itself  (vs. 6ab), a discovery that allows them to protect their own (6c), and that also  leads to the beneficial actions of Agni in the world of men (6d, 7). More benefits  follow in verses 8–9, though the connection of these to what precedes is admit tedly hazy. The “deposit” in a central entity, here Agni, that is the heart of the  Tānūnaptra pact seems to reappear in verse 10, in a context both cosmogonic  (10b) and apparently ritual (10cd).  
The depiction of Agni in this hymn as the locus for the joint deposit of the bod ies of the gods in the Tānūnaptra myth is the mirror and complementary image of  Agni Vaiśvānara, the fire “belonging to all men,” around which all the allied human  clans rally, in the earlier hymns of Parāśara Śāktya’s Agni cycle (esp. I.68–70).
