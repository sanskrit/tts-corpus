‘ ततं मे ' इति नवर्चं पञ्चमं सूक्तं कुत्सस्यार्षं ऋभुदेवताकम् । पञ्चमीनवम्यौ त्रिष्टुभौ । शिष्टाः सप्त जगत्यः । तथा चानुक्रान्तं - ‘ ततं नवार्भवं तु पञ्चम्यन्त्ये त्रिष्टुभौ ' इति ॥ अभिप्लवषडहस्य चतुर्थेऽहनि वैश्वदेवशस्त्रे इदमार्भवं निविद्धानम् । सूत्रितं च  ‘ तृतीयस्य ' इति खण्डे -- ततं मे अप इति वैश्वदेवम् ' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ७. ७ ) इति ॥ ततं मे अपस्तदु तायते पुनः स्वादिष्ठा धीतिरुचथाय शस्यते ।

R̥bhus  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5 and 9  
The R̥bhus are originally mortal craftsmen who achieved immortality because of a  series of marvelous deeds. This hymn begins in the ritual here-and-now, where the  R̥bhus, already immortal, are offered their share of the sacrifice by the poet-sacri ficer, who speaks in the 1st person. The story of their achievement is then begun  in verse 2, with the R̥bhus depicted as itinerant skilled workers, rather like the poet  and his comrades (thus perhaps holding out the hope that immortality will come  to them as well). The particular feats they accomplished are then recounted, with  special emphasis on their turning Tvaṣṭar’s single cup into four (vss. 3, 5), the oth ers hurriedly covered in verse 8, interspersed with pleas for their favor.
