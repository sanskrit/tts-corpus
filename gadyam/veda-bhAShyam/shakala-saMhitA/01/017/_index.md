‘ इन्द्रावरुणयोः' इत्यादिकं नवर्चं षष्ठं सूक्तम् । अत एव नवशब्दानुवृत्तावनुक्रम्यते- इन्द्रावरुणयोरैन्द्रावरुणं युवाकु पादनिचृतौ ' इति । अत्र देवता विस्पष्टा । ऋषिच्छन्दसी तु पूर्ववदनुवर्तेते । अयं तु विशेषः ।  ‘ युवाकु हि' इत्यादिके द्वे ऋचौ पादनिचृन्नामकच्छन्दोयुक्ते । विनियोगस्तु स्मार्तो लैङ्गिको वा कश्चिदवगन्तव्यः ।।

Indra and Varuṇa  
Medhātithi Kāṇva  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
Like Medhātithi’s other hymns, this address to Indra and Varuṇa is elementary in con tents: the poet calls upon those gods to aid him and give him lavish gifts in exchange  for hymns. The two gods are addressed together, and there is no mention of the dis tinctive qualities of either god. Only in verse 5, the middle verse, are the gods sepa rated, and even there the structures in which they appear are parallel and colorless. In  contrast to the predictable and banal contents, the syntax of the hymn is surprisingly  problematic. There are a number of ellipses that cannot be reliably filled (see, e.g., the  parenthetic additions in verses 3–6) and syntactic clashes that are difficult to rational ize (e.g., in verse 4, whose translation skates over some of the problems). The poet  may have been trying to inject some surprise into a tired poetic assignment.
