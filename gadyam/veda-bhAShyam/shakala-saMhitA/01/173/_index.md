Indra  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
13 verses: triṣṭubh  
The opening of the hymn (vss. 1–4) depicts the beginning of a sacrifice, as the priests  assemble and raise the song of praise and the other features of the sacrifice take their  places. The expectation of Indra’s arrival and enjoyment of the sacrifice ends verse  4. The next three verses (5–7) constitute a formal praise of Indra, with a lovely image  (vs. 6) of the god dressed in all the parts of the cosmos. These three verses, especially  verse 7, also depict Indra as a feisty combatant whom competing forces wish to have  on their side; the striking image in 7ab is of a tug-of-war. In the next verses (8–9) we  redouble our efforts to secure him for our sacrifice. Verse 10 reprises the theme of  Indra as the focus of competing factions, in a very dense and complex set of images,  while verse 11 expresses the ritualists’ belief that a properly performed sacrifice will  bring Indra here, however long it takes. The meandering route of the sacrifice in that  verse is replicated in form by the meandering syntax. Verse 12 is a thematic departure,  as well as a return to the rivalry of Indra and the Maruts over Agastya’s sacrifice;  here the poet once again offers sacrifice to both parties. The hymn ends (vs. 13) with  a familiar type of summary verse, with internal reference to the poem that is ending.  
As a product of Agastya, this hymn poses many verbal puzzles and provides  many verbal rewards.

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

Indra The beginning of the hymn is characterized by pāda-initial injunctives in -at (1a gā́yat, 2a árcat, 3a nákṣat, 3b bhárat, 3c krándat; note also non-initial ruvád 3c and carat 3d). It is not surprising that this assemblage attracted the attention of Hoffmann, who tr. the first three vss. (Injunc., 143-44). The function of these forms is of course underdefined; I render them as simple general presents, more or less with Hoffmann (“die generalle Beschreibung eines Opfers”), sim. Geldner By contrast, Renou takes them all as modal (“qu’il chante …,” etc.).

Another verbal pattern is the repetition of forms of the root √bhṛ: 2c bhárate, 3b bhárat, 4b bharante, 6d bhárti. In this case the poet seems to want to display how many different idiomatic meanings he can find in this root.
