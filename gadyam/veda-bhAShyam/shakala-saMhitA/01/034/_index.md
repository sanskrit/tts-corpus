Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa  
12 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 9, 12  
This hymn has a simple and very insistent organizing principle: the number three.  The Aśvins, of whom there are, of course, two, are urged to perform various actions  three times a day, using equipment, especially their chariot, that has numerous tri ple features. The particular ritual reason for the glorification of three must be the  three soma-pressings, but this ritual application is not made clear until verse 8. If,  as we have argued, the Third Pressing is a ritual innovation in the R̥gveda, a hymn  devoted to extolling it is not surprising.  
The hymn falls into two unequal parts, each ending with a triṣṭubh verse (vss.  1–9, 10–12). In the first part the number three is especially celebrated, though the  number is not absent in the second part (see vss. 11 and 12). The last three verses  invite the Aśvins to drink the soma and to offer us rewards in return. Despite the  metrical punctuation and the change in emphasis in the brief second part, there is  no reason not to consider this hymn a unity.  
From the grammatical point of view, the hymn contains what many scholars  (including us) take as a precious archaism, the single occurrence of the phrase sū́re  duhitā́ “daughter of the Sun” (vs. 5d), preserving in sū́re the sandhi of final -as of  the genitive *sū́ras as -e before a dental in close phrasal sandhi. (For general discus  
sion of this phenomenon, see Jamison 2010.) It perhaps escaped modernization  because the focus of the hymn was not on the mythological marriage of Sūryā,  daughter of the Sun, and she is only mentioned because of the incidental fact that  the chariot she mounted had three standing places.
