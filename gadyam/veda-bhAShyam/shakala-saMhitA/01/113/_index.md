Dawn (except Dawn and Night 1cd)  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
20 verses: triṣṭubh  
Dawn often brings out the best in R̥gvedic poets, and this hymn is no exception.  It consists of separate groups of thematically unified verses without seeming dis jointed, because there is an overall theme: unity amid diversity.  
In the first three verses Dawn is contrasted with her opposite number, her sister  Night, but they are eternally conjoined and regularly alternating according to the  divine plan. Verses 4–6, marked off by a pāda-length refrain, present the diversity  of the animate world. Dawn wakes all creatures, and they all have different goals to  pursue in their waking lives, while all being subject to Dawn. Verse 7 provides both  summary and transition; it almost sounds like a hymn-final verse. The substantial middle section of the hymn (vss. 8–15) sees a different kind of  unity in diversity, in what is perhaps the most challenging conceptual question  about dawn. Every day has a dawn and every day’s dawn is, in some sense, the  same, while being quite distinct. Today’s dawn has been preceded by countless many  and will be followed by countless many; she is both last and first. But she is also  the capitalized and personified single Dawn. This conceptual puzzle is presented in  verse 8 (especially the first half), and the gist and lexicon of 8ab are repeated in the  final verse of this section, 15cd, forming a ring around the section. The most dif ficult verse in the hymn, verse 10, also treats this same problem, and the next verse  (11) draws the melancholy conclusion: just as there were earlier dawns, now gone,  so were there earlier mortals who saw those dawns—and others will follow and  replace us, to see the dawns to come. Verse 13 provides indirect solace, by reframing  the many dawns as one Dawn, who dawned before, dawns now, and will continue  to dawn. (The other verses in this section, 9, 12, and 14, simply concern the current  Dawn, in fairly standard terms.)  
The final section (vss. 16–20) begins (vs. 16) with a triumphal exhortation, which  indirectly counters the consciousness of inevitable death attending on time stated  in verse 11 with the announcement that life is lengthened by the advent of dawn.  The following verses treat the early-morning ritual: the response of the sacrificial  fire (vs. 17), the offering to Vāyu (vs. 18), the recitation and singing of praise (vss.  17–18), and, of course, the gifts that are distributed at the dawn sacrifice by Dawn  herself (vss. 17–20).
