Maruts (except Indra 1)  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
A particularly fine example of Agastya’s poetic skill. The first few verses invite first  Indra (vs. 1) and then the Maruts (vs. 2) to come to us; the last few verses (8–10)  before the refrain (vs. 11) celebrate the massive strength of the Maruts (vss. 8cd–9),  and again express the hope that Indra and the Maruts will stand by us (vs. 10), with  a curious detour through the topic of the Ādityas’ protective powers (vs. 8ab).  
But the heart of the hymn (vss. 3–7) is devoted to the Maruts’ relationship with  their consort Rodasī, whose name is identical, save for accent, with the dual referring  to the “two world-halves” (rodasī versus ́ ródasī, though the latter can also some times be used for Rodasī). The verses are marked by what in Classical Sanskrit poetry  would be called śleṣa (“punning”), and the tone is curiously mixed: Rodasī is both extravagantly praised and at the same time scornfully compared to a loose woman,  with those two incompatible attitudes conveyed in the same words. (Unfortunately,  the understated deftness of these verbal plays is overwhelmed by our necessarily  labored and clumsy explanations.) For example, in verse 3 Rodasī is compared to a  young woman running after men by going to the public gaming hall, but also com  
pared to fine ceremonial speech appropriate to a public occasion. The same word  (sabhā́vatī) is used both for her shameful appearance in the public hall and her role as  speech honored in public. In verse 4 the word sādhāraṇyā́ “common” is used both of  the Maruts’ joint cherishing of Rodasī and in a simile comparing her to a whore. (This  kind of verbal condemnation of a polyandrous woman is familiar in later Sanskrit  in the taunts sometimes directed to the noble Draupadī, wife of the five Pāṇḍavas in  the Mahābhārata.) A complex pun in the second half of verse 4 plays with the partial  identity of Rodasī and the two world-halves; the grammatical aspects of this pun  cannot be treated here. Despite the somewhat slighting treatment in the similes of  verses 3–4, Rodasī takes on the role of bride in verses 5–6 by mounting the nuptial  chariot like the mythological model of the bride, Sūryā. This depiction of ceremonial  marriage provides a transition to the ritual here-and-now (vss. 6cd–7), where not only  the Maruts, but also Rodasī along with the Wives of the Gods, appear at our ritual.
