Agni  
Nodhas Gautama  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Two double aspects of Agni, touched on in the two previous Agni hymns by Nodhas  Gautama, are united in this brief hymn. On the one hand, Agni’s primal installation  in the sacrifice by the ancestors of humankind is contrasted with his regular re-instal lation by the current sacrificers (see esp. vs. 2ab, but also throughout). In fact, the orig inal theft of fire from heaven by Mātariśvan, who bestowed it on the legendary Bhr̥gu,  ends the first verse. In several places (2c, 3d, 4b, 4d) it is not possible to determine  from the verb form whether the poet is referring to the distant and legendary past or  the recent past of the current ritual, though unfortunately English imposes the choice.  The aorist forms in question often refer to the immediate past, and so we have trans lated them (“has been set down,” etc.), but an unmarked past (“was set down,” etc.)  is far from excluded. It is quite likely that the poet wished to leave the question open.  
The other double aspect treated is Agni’s dual role in the sacrifice: he both acts  as priest and is the object of ritual activity by human priests. See especially verse  2b, where the Uśij (“fire-priests”) present oblations to him, and 4a, where Agni is  identified as an Uśij (as well as a Hotar, in 4b).

Agni Taking off from my comment below on vs. 5, Jesse Lundquist has further articulated the structure of this hymn. What follows is mostly verbatim from his comments, with some additions and light editing of my own: I think this little hymn might have a slightly more elegant structure than has been appreciated (I thought of this following your mention ad vs. 5 of the “faint ring”). It seems to me that the 5 verses are nicely balanced rings within rings revolving around vs. 3, the omphalos-like jā́yamānam… jījananta, harking back to Agni’s double birth in 1c. The outer rings would be, as mentioned ad vs. 5, vss. 1c rayím iva praśastám = 5 pátim ... rayīnā́m, prá śaṃsāmaḥ. Vss. 2 and 4 contain the same word vikṣú; note esp. the alliterative and partly etymological figure in 2d viśpátir vikṣú vedhā́ḥ. The hymn has not only a ring structure, but also forward momentum provided by the movement from the larger social organization of the vís-, in the full expression viśpátir vikṣú (2d), to the more intimate setting of the home, emphatically presented in 4c dámūnā gṛ́hapatir dáme. The momentum can also be tracked in the expressions of lordship involving páti-: viśpáti- (2d) to gṛhapáti- (4c) and finally the solemnly pleonastic+++(=redundant)+++ rayipátī rayīṇā́m (4d). Agni, celebrated (√śaṃs) “like wealth” in 1c (rayím iva), is transformed into the lord of wealth in 4d. This final title is repeated in 5a pátim agne rayīṇā́m, with his name interposed between the two elements, and again the object of √śaṃs. The use of these three -páti- compounds may convey the message that Agni will deploy his wealth in the arenas of clan and house.
