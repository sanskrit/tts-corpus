176  
Indra  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
6 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Though also in dimeter meter, this hymn displays an exuberance that the previ ous one (I.175) lacks. Both hymns begin with the same imperative (mátsi “become  exhilarated”) and end with the same verse (6), but in this hymn the soma drop is  generally the addressee, urged to mastermind Indra’s great actions, and especially  to help Indra destroy his, and our, enemies. The language is lively and the images  unclichéd; note for example verse 2cd, where the scattering of power is likened to  the sowing of seed in furrows just plowed by a bull.
