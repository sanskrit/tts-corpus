77  
Agni  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is in some ways a twin to the last one: both have five triṣṭubh verses,  and both open with a verse of questions about the proper way to serve Agni, using  some of the same vocabulary (e.g., dāśema “we should piously serve” I.77.1a and  I.76.1d). Lexical similarities continue through the hymn: śáṃtama “most beneficial”  (77.2a, 76.1b), various forms of the verb √vī “pursue” (77.2c, 4b; 76.4c), et cetera.  Like I.76, this hymn also focuses on Agni’s role as priest and sacrificer, although the  rhetoric in this hymn is somewhat more expansive than in I.76.

These two Triṣṭubh hymns are out of sequence, in that they both contain five verses. The preceding hymn I.75 in Gāyatrī also contains five verses, and among hymns of the same number of verses to the same divinity, those in the longer meter (in this case Triṣṭubh) should precede. Curiously, Oldenberg does not remark on this. The proper sequencing is restored with I.78, five verses in Gāyatrī.
