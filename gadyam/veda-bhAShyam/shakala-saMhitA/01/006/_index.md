6  
Indra (1–3, 10), Maruts (4, 6, 8–9), Indra and Maruts (5, 7)  
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra  
10 verses: gāyatrī  
A disjointed and episodic hymn. The Anukramaṇī ascription of the verses to a  combination of Indra and the Maruts is reproduced in the above heading, but it  is almost certainly wrong—though the confusion generated by the hymn makes  the error pardonable. The Maruts do not appear to figure in the hymn at all, and,  though Indra does, there are other divine figures in some of the verses assigned to  him. As often, the hymn jumps back and forth from 2nd- to 3rd-person reference  and from past to present time, but in this case the jumps are particularly disorient  
ing and the overall structure hard to discern.  
Modern attempts at interpretation generally begin with the Vala myth and the  main divine personages therein, Indra and the Aṅgirases, his singer-assistants in  this myth. The myth is most clearly alluded to in verse 5, the central verse (espe cially if vs. 10 is considered to be a mere variant of parallel vs. 9), and we may see  here an interesting structural contrast to the omphalos hymn: instead of embedding  the mystery in the middle verse and leading up to and away from it with clearer  material, the poet here may have designed the middle verse as the key to the many  questions posed by the diffuse fragments surrounding it and a motif in which to  integrate them.  
In any case verse 5 presents us with Indra finding the hidden cows within a  stronghold with the help of an unnamed group, who must be the Aṅgirases. In  our view this myth does provide the thematic backdrop for the whole hymn and is  alluded to directly (or as directly as it gets) also in verses 6 and 8. But most of the  rest of the hymn treats the ritual re-creation of Indra’s releasing the dawns from the  Vala cave—namely the rising of the sun, the kindling of the ritual fire, and Indra’s  journey to the early-morning sacrifice, and the most enigmatic verses refer, in our  view, to Agni—not, as in other interpretations, to the sun or to Indra.  
A brief and tentative synopsis: the first two verses, parallel in structure, depict  the simultaneous hitching up of the sun (vs. 1) and Indra’s chariot (vs. 2) for their  

respectively daily journeys. These verses are set in the present moment. Verse 3 is  structurally paired with verse 7 in the architecture of the hymn; both are addressed  to an unidentified 2nd sg. referent—in our view Agni, who is kindled at dawn (vs.  3) at the same time as Indra arrives at the sacrifice (vs. 7). Verse 3 is set in the mythic  past, perhaps at Agni’s first kindling by the Aṅgirases, an event also presented in  verse 4, while verse 7 returns us to the present. (Verse 3 also contains an absolutely  baffling 2nd plural vocative, “o young men,” embedded within a verse with entirely  2nd singular reference. Short of emendation, there is little to be done with it, though  it may refer to the plural subjects of verse 4, the fire-priests, who kindled the embry onic Agni.) Verse 5 provides the Vala-myth clue, and the remainder of the verses  meld a mythic account of the rituals of dawn with reference to the ritual of the  present moment.

Indra and the Maruts (per Anukr.) As noted in the introduction. the Anukramaṇī’s identification of the divinities as Indra (1-3, 10), Maruts (4, 6, 8-9), and Indra and Maruts (5, 7) does not conform to the content of the hymn, which is quite disjointed, but appears to concern, at least in part, the Vala myth. The Maruts do not seem to figure at all in the hymn; the plural entities with Indra are probably the Aṅgirases. For my view of the structure (which is informed by the discussions of Geldner and Oldenberg), see published introduction.

I.6.1-2: These verses begin identically (yuñjánti ‘they yoke’), inviting the audience to equate the action of the two verses.

1b: The referent of the apparent acc. plural tasthúṣaḥ ‘(those) standing still’ is not given. Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) thinks it refers to stable things on the earth, but if the sun is referred to in the first pāda, it is more likely to “move around” celestial features than earthly ones, and the stars or other luminous heavenly bodies are referred to in the next pāda. Renou’s interpretation (flg. Ludwig) of tasthúṣaḥ as an abl. sg. (“from the one standing still” - “à partir de (l’espace) immobile”) is ingenious and would match the minor syntactic idiom ‘yoke from ABL’ (e.g., I.115.4 yadéd áyukta harítaḥ sadhásthāt), so it cannot be dismissed. The ablatives in the final verses (9-10) might lend weak support for Renou’s view.

2b: The hapax compound vípakṣasā is difficult and has been variously interpreted. The second member, pákṣas- (and related and more common pakṣá-), can mean either ‘wing’ or ‘side’; the first member, ví-, is most likely the preverb ví, but in compounds this element has a number of possible meanings: ‘without’, distant’, ‘wide’,‘alternating/opposite/different’, ‘dispersed’. It could also possibly represent ví- ‘bird’, which has been claimed as the first member of some other compounds (see EWA s.v. váy-, KEWA III.266). The possible combinations of these two ambiguous elements allow for a number of interpretations. I more or less follow the Sāyaṇa/Grassmann interpretation, ‘auf beiden Seiten des Wagens gehend’, though I take it as an adverbial instrumental, not a dual. (The presence of a number of duals in -ā in the verse does not favor an adverbial interpretation, however.) Renou’s “aux ailes d’oiseau” obviously takes the first member as the ‘bird’ word, while Witzel Gotō “die mit weiten Flügeln” takes ví as the preverb, but with the second member meaning ‘wing’ as in Renou’s interpretation. Geldner’s ‘auseinanderstrebenden(?)’ treats the second member quite loosely.
