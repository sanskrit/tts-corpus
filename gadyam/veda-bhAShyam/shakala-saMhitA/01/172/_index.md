Maruts  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
3 verses: gāyatrī  
A brief and simple pendant to Agastya’s Indra/Marut cycle. The Maruts as bring ers of rain are celebrated as sudā́nu “having good drops” (vss. 1–3), an epithet that  can also mean “having good gifts.” The poet asks that the negative aspects of the  thunderstorm stay far away from him and his people.
