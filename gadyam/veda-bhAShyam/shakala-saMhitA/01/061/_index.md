61  
Indra  
Nodhas Gautama  
16 verses: triṣṭubh  
The three Indra hymns by Nodhas share a ritual context: judging from their last  verses (I.61.16, 62.13, 63.9) they were all composed to accompany the Hāriyojana  (“Fallow-bay-yoking”) oblation, when Indra’s pair of horses is yoked up for the  god’s return journey to heaven after the sacrifice is complete. The parts of these  hymns before the final verse do not seem to reflect this ritual moment, and the three  hymns are quite different, though they all display Nodhas’s remarkable poetic skill.  
This first hymn, I.61, is a masterpiece of intricate structure and verbal trickery.  We will summarize the main points here, but for more detailed treatment see the  lengthy discussion in Jamison (2007: 60–68). The most obvious structural device is  the fronted repetition of a deictic pronoun: each of the sixteen verses except the last  (which is an extra-hymnic summary verse) begins with either the dative asmaí “for  him” or the genitive asyá “of him,” followed by two emphasizing particles, always  referring to Indra (except in vs. 12—see below). The dative sequence is the more  common and frames the hymn (vss. 1–6, 8, 12, 15); the genitive sequence is found  primarily in the center of the hymn (vss. 7, 9–11, 13–14).  
This rigid structural device both parallels and counterpoints the semantic  structure of the hymn. In general in this hymn the dative verses express the ritual  here-and-now, with the production and presentation of hymns and ritual offer ings “to/for just this one,” while the genitive verses concern Indra’s great deeds.  Especially in the dative verses numerous co-referential adjectival datives reinforce  the fronted pronoun, as well as strategically placed dative tokens of the god’s name.  Curiously, in the genitive verses the genitive several times (vss. 7, 10, 11) seems to  have quite a loose syntactic connection to the rest of the sentence, and Indra may  appear in another case in the same verse, as in 

> 61.10ab asyéd evá śávasā śuṣántaṃ, ví vr̥ścad vájreṇa vr̥trám índraḥ  
> Of just this one [gen.]—in (his) expansion Indra [nom.] hewed apart  snorting Vr̥tra with his mace.  

But what may appear superficially to be clumsy composition serves a larger  structural purpose:  it seems that the logical structure of the hymn requires a  two-way opposition, between dative asmaí and something else: the something else  is genitive asyá even when a different case form might have been more appropriate,  for a variety of other cases would have obscured the bipartite contrastive structure  of the hymn. Here we see an example of clausal morphosyntax subordinated to and  indeed distorted by the imposition of a larger literary and rhetorical pattern.  
The poet Nodhas also lays a few traps for us by playing on the expectations he  has created. Most notable of them is verse 12, which begins with the dative asmaí and therefore appears to return us from the mythological past to the realm of the  current-day poet of verses 1–5, an expectation reinforced by the verb prá bharā, a standard lexeme for presenting a hymn to a divinity. But the phrase in verse 12  quickly goes awry. At the opening of the next pāda, where Indra’s name has been  prominently placed in previous verses (índrāya 1d, 4d, 5b, 8b), we find, most shock ingly, the name of his arch-enemy, vr̥trā́ya, immediately followed by the accusative  object vájram, Indra’s weapon, not the word for hymn we were expecting. The poet  has simply tricked us, having laid a trap with conventional phraseology and syntax  and with the stylistic patterns established earlier in the hymn. He also skillfully  exploits the morphological ambiguity of the verb form bharā: given the pattern set  in verses 1–5 we are primed to interpret bharā as a 1st sg. subjunctive (“I shall pres  
ent”), but as the half verse unfolds, it becomes clear that bharā must rather be taken  as a metrically lengthened 2nd singular imperative (“bear down!”).  
The meter of this hymn is often irregular, with a number of ten-syllable lines,  but again this irregularity should not be taken as a sign of poor poetic technique.  Rather the hymn seems to be phrase-driven rather than meter-driven, and the metri cal rests that result from “missing syllables” serve to isolate and emphasize crucial  nominal phrases—an effect also heightened by the copious examples of alliteration.  
With all the poetic fireworks on display the actual contents of the hymn may  seem almost beside the point, but we will provide a brief sketch. The first five verses  (“dative verses”) are variations on a theme: the poet’s verbal offerings to Indra. The  sixth verse, also a dative verse, modulates to the distant past and the god Tvaṣṭar’s gift  of the newly fashioned mace to Indra. Verse 7 combines two rare Indra myths: his  appropriation of his father’s soma right after his birth and the Emuṣa myth, in which  the god Viṣṇu steals a mess of rice porridge while Indra shoots the boar Emuṣa.  (For further on this myth, see Introduction, p. 40.) Verses 8–12 treat the Vr̥tra myth  for the most part, though with some detours. Verses 13–15 generalize the praise of  Indra’s deeds and bring it back to the present time and to the present poet, Nodhas,  who names himself in verse 14, while the final verse, 16, summarizes the hymn that  precedes and names the ritual application, the “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation.  
It is difficult to do justice to this tour de force of poetic craft, and many of its  finest effects have not been discussed here. It is, unfortunately, even more difficult to  do justice to it in English translation.
