101  
Indra  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
11 verses: jagatī 1–7, triṣṭubh 8–11  
The structure of this hymn is under tight control, giving pleasure both by its pre dictable repetitions and by their breaches. Though the hymn falls into two unequal  metrical segments, there is no reason not to consider it a unity: the two segments  complement each other, structurally and thematically. (One might fancifully com pare it to the 8 / 6 structure of a Petrarchan sonnet.)  
The jagatī section (vss. 1–7) is characterized most obviously by its refrain, occu pying all of the fourth pāda of each verse. Interestingly this refrain lacks the name  

Indra, though this name appears in first or (modified) second position in each of  the third pādas, save for verse 1. Instead it is his connection with the Maruts that  is foregrounded in the refrain, using the same stem, though in a different case,  that appeared in the refrain of I.100. Verses 1 and 7 also deviate from the signa  
ture stylistic feature of the middle verses (2–6), that the first three-fourths of these  verses are all relative clauses: a form of the relative pronoun begins each verse, and  each of the two subsequent pādas in each verse contains (and often begins) with  at least one. (Note the explosion of relative pronouns in the final verse 6: five in  three pādas.) This arrangement, with most of the verse devoted to relative clauses  but ending with a main clause refrain, reminds us of the famous Indra hymn II.12,  with its identificatory refrain “He, o peoples, is Indra!” But this one is more com  
plex, in that Indra is not identified directly in the refrain. The jagatī section is also  demarcated by a faint ring, the verb “address” (prá... arcatā 1a, abhy àrcati 7c), and  by the fact that Indra is referred to only in the 3rd person in a series of definitional  descriptions in the indicative.  
By contrast, the triṣṭubh verses (8–11) switch to direct address to Indra (save for  the final, summary verse with the Kutsa refrain) and to urgent invitations to him  to come to our sacrifice. The Marut theme is continued, however—already in the  first pāda of the first triṣṭubh verse (8a) with a vocative of the same stem (marútvant  
“accompanied by the Maruts”) that dominated the jagatī refrain. (See also 9c, 11a.)  A faint ring also defines the triṣṭubh verses, with vr̥jána “(ritual) circle” in both 8b  and 11a.  
As for content, it is largely familiar, praising Indra for his victories over various  enemies, for his aid to mortals hard pressed in battle, and for his steadfast lordship.  Needless to say, the Marut element is quite strong, as in the preceding hymn (I.110).  The most striking formulation may be found in the first verse, with its image of  Indra causing the fortresses of the enemy to abort their fetuses.
