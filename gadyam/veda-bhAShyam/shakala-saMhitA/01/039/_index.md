‘प्र यदित्था' इति दशर्चं चतुर्थं सूक्तम् । घोरपुत्रस्य कण्वस्यार्षं मरुद्देवताकम् । युजः सतोबृहत्यः । अयुजो बृहत्यः ।  ‘ प्र यद्दश प्रागाथं तु ' इत्यनुक्रमणिका । गतो विनियोगः ॥

Maruts  
Kaṇva Ghaura  
10 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas  
The weighty register and solemn syntax of this hymn contrast with the light texture  and somewhat colloquial register of the last two hymns (I.37–38), also dedicated to  the Maruts but in a different meter, even though the rapid-fire questions of verse  1cd remind us of the abrupt questions of I.38.1–3.  
Here the poet hopes to harness the overwhelming power of the Maruts in order  to protect himself and his people from some looming, but not entirely defined,  threat. This hope is expressed especially nakedly in the last part of the hymn, verses  7–10. In the earlier parts of the hymn the poet praises the power of the Maruts in  a formal style, but by stating that this might cannot be challenged (vss. 2cd, 4), he  hints that it could in fact encounter a challenge.  
The usual buoyant descriptions of the Maruts’ appearance and behavior as the  thunderstorm are muted in this hymn. They serve only to illustrate what power  might be available to the poet and his people (vss. 3, 5–6).
