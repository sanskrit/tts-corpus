‘अग्नीषोमौ' इति द्वादशर्चं नवमं सूक्तं गोतमस्यार्षम्। आदितस्तिस्रोऽनुष्टुभः । नवम्याद्यास्तिस्रो गायत्र्यः । अष्टमी जगती त्रिष्टुब्वा । शिष्टाः पञ्च त्रिष्टुभः । अग्नीषोमौ देवता । तथा चानुक्रान्तम् -- ‘ अग्नीषोमौ द्वादशाग्नीषोमीयमाद्यास्तिस्रोऽनुष्टुभ उपान्त्यास्तिस्रो' गायत्र्योऽष्टमी जगती वा ' इति । अग्नीषोमीयस्य पशोर्वपापुरोडाशहविषामादितस्तिस्र ऋचः क्रमेणानुवाक्याः । सूत्रितं च- अग्नीषोमाविमं सु मे युवमेतानि दिवि रोचनानीति तृचौ ' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ३.८) इति ॥

Agni and Soma  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
12 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–3, triṣṭubh 4–8, gāyatrī 9–11, triṣṭubh 12  
Another metrically complex hymn, this is the last attributed to Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  in Maṇḍala I. Despite the variety of meters, the piece is unified by the emphasis on  the two gods to whom it is dedicated, and especially by the presence of the dvandva  compound agnī́-ṣómā “Agni and Soma” in every verse. This compound is found  only twice elsewhere in the R̥gveda (both times in Maṇḍala X). Although Agni and  Soma are the quintessential ritual divinities, each representing a crucial sacrificial  substance, this is the only hymn in the R̥gveda explicitly dedicated to them together,  and it is a fairly banal product. However, it is worth noting that, at least in our  view, V.44, sometimes called the hardest hymn in the R̥gveda, seems to concern  Agni and Soma simultaneously, though it is identified in the Anukramaṇī as an All  God hymn.  
The essential unity of the hymn is also discernible in its fairly simple  thematic-cum-syntactic structure, which regularly constructs the verse as a rela tive clause referring to the actions of a pious mortal (“whoever serves [etc.]... ”),  and a main clause expressing his reward (see vss. 2–3, 8, 10), as well as in repeated  vocabulary in the earlier and later parts (see, e.g., matches between vss. 2 and 8, 3  and 10). The hymn also has an outer ring: the last word (12d śruṣṭimántam “having  an attentive hearing”) recalls the first verb of the hymn (1b śr̥ṇutam), the imperative  “hear, listen!”  
One part of the hymn stands out, verses 4–6, which ascribe various mythological  deeds to the pair. Curiously, the deeds in verses 4 and 5 are really more appropri ate to other gods: the mysterious Br̥saya and the theft in verse 4 are found also  in a hymn to the river goddess Sarasvatī (VI.61.1, 3), while verse 5 sounds like  a generic praise of Indra. In verse 6, however, we do find mythological material  appropriate to the two gods addressed, namely the story of the stealing of those  gods. This is, tellingly, the only place in the hymn where the two gods are treated  separately: Mātariśvan is the figure who stole fire, while the falcon’s theft of soma  from heaven is also often alluded to.
