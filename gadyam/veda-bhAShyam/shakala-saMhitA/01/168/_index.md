Maruts  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8–10  
After an appeal to the Maruts from the poet-sacrificer (vs. 1), the hymn settles down  with gusto to a description of the Maruts as thunderstorm, a description executed  with all of Agastya’s artistry. It is rich with elaborate and trickily constructed simi les and with striking images and jarring turns of phrase. For the latter, consider  the first simile in verse 2: “self-produced like fissures.” Neither the contents of the  simile itself nor its application to the Maruts is immediately clear, but on further  reflection the “self-produced fissures” call to mind earthquakes and their sudden  and unpredictable power to open fissures in the ground, and this image seems an  apt comparandum with the Maruts and their impetuous exercise of their power.  Agastya plays with syntax, too, as in 5b where the verb “quiver” is used transitively  in the frame of the simile and intransitively in the simile itself. In fact, in this hymn  Agastya seems to want to deploy as many different types of structurally and con  
ceptually twisted images as he can (the technical details of all of which we cannot  treat here).  
The theme throughout is that, although the Maruts display great violence in  their stormy onslaught, the result is the welcome and fructifying rain (see most clearly vs. 7). This theme is nicely expressed in 3cd, which juxtaposes and combines  the warlike and the peaceful: a spear compared to a woman (see also the previ ous hymn, 167.3), and dagger and bangle placed together in their hands, a pairing  emphasized by their phonological similarity: khādíś ca kr̥tíś ca.
