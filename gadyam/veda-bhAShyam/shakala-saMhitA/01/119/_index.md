Aśvins  
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa  
10 verses: jagatī  
The hymn begins along expected lines with a summons to the Aśvins to come to  the sacrifice (vs. 1). However, the offering mentioned is not soma, but rather the hot  milk (gharmá) of the Pravargya rite (vs. 2cd). In 2cd and probably verse 3 Kakṣīvant  describes the arrival of the Aśvins, who bring Sūryā, the Daughter of the Sun, to  her wedding. The bridegroom of Sūryā is Soma in the late R̥gveda (X.85), but in 5cd she chooses the Aśvins themselves as her husbands. Pirart (1995: 252) suggests  that yuvā́m pátī is a corruption for yuvā́m pátim* and therefore the line means that  Sūryā chose “the young (Soma) as her husband.” But if the gharmá in this hymn  in some sense displaces the soma, perhaps the poet has replaced the god Soma by  the deities of the Pravargya rite, the Aśvins. For further on the self-choice marriage  of Sūryā and Kakṣīvant’s treatments of it, see Jamison (2001). In this connection  verse 3 contains one of Kakṣīvant’s characteristic verbal tricks: the phrase sūrím  ā́ váram, which literally means “the patron according to his will,” is a scrambling  of *sūriyā́m váram, with a reference to Sūryā (whose name is normally read trisyl labically as Sūr(i)yā) and her svayaṃ-vara (self-choice) marriage. This scrambled  phrase is “repaired” in verse 5 with the straightforward declaration of her choice.  See Jamison (2006).
