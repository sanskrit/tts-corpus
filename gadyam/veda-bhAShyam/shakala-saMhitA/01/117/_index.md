Aśvins  
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa  
25 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is a catalogue of the heroic deeds of the Aśvins, which ultimately leads  to the poet’s request for heroes (vs. 25). The problem for the poet is that such a  hymn listing so many of the gods’ deeds could easily become just an inventory  without any real coherence. One of the poet’s solutions to this problem is to create  verbal and thematic linkages among verses and sets of verses in order to organize  and unify his composition.  
At the highest level the great deeds of the Aśvins are arranged according to  theme. First are deeds in which the Aśvins rescue those who have been hidden away  in some fashion: Atri in the earth cleft (3), Rebha in the waters (4), and Vandana  in the ground (5). Then, the poet shifts from the Aśvins’ rescues to their generosity.  The theme is announced in verse 6 and then exemplified in verses 7–9. The Aśvins  give the gift of a wife (7ab) and husband (7cd), a bright body (8ab), fame (8cd),  and a horse (9). Verse 10 then summarizes this theme and announces a new one  

that extends the image of the horse in verse 9. The deeds in the next section turn on  the Aśvins as charioteers and horsemen. They bring prizes to the poet (11ab) and  restore the racing mare Viśpalā (11d). Verses 12–16 connect the Aśvins’ deeds to  the journeys of their chariot and horses. On those journeys they come to the aid of  Cyavāna, Bhujyu, and others. The last extended set of verses, verses 16–22, describe  a variety of different acts, but all these verses mention animals: a quail (16), sheep  and a she-wolf (17–18), a barren cow (20), a “wolf” (possibly a plow; 21), and the  head of a horse (22). This leaves aside verse 19, but the “lame one” here is probably  the mare Viśpalā, one suggestion of Sāyaṇa. Note that the last two sets of verses  overlap at verse 16, a join that again helps hold the poem together.  
Another way the poet creates a sense of unity is by the repetition of lexical items,  sometimes used in different contexts. So, the poet uses the unusual verb sám √rī “draw  back together” in verses 4, 11, and 19 to describe a rescue from the sea, the repair  of a horse, and the healing of the “lame one.” Or again, the Aśvins carried down  (ní...ūhathuḥ) a horse or a bride (9b, 20d) and carried Bhujyu out (níḥ...ūhathuḥ) of  the sea (14d, 15c). In 5c níkhāta “buried” describes Vandana; níkhāta occurs again in  12c, although it is not clear to whom the latter verse refers. Sāyaṇa suggests that it is  Rebha, who was “buried” in the waters, an interpretation supported by the reference  to the tenth day (cf. I.116.24). However, since the verb níkhāta was just used with  Vandana in verse 5cd, it may be he to whom the verse refers.  
Likewise, the poet links consecutive verses by repeating the same or similar  words. The Aśvins rescue the seer (ŕ̥ṣi) Atri in 3a and the seer Rebha in 4b. Each of  verses 20–22 addresses the aśvinā and the “wondrous ones” (dasrā/dasrau). The four  hemistichs of verses 13 and 14 all begin with yuvóḥ or yuvám. Verses 15 and 16 both  begin ájohavīt “he called again and again.” Such verbal concatenation again helps  unify the diverse contents of the hymn.  
The poet explores other kinds of verbal play, some of which create intercon nections within the poem, but others reflect other purposes or simply his artistry  as a poet. For example, víṣakta “drooping” of 20a is phonologically rearranged in  24c as the rare word víkasta “split apart.” There appears to be another phonologi cal connection in verse 16cd between viṣvā́c, the personal name Viṣvāc, which may  mean the “Double-Talker,” and viṣá “poison.” However, the interpretation of this  hemistich is problematic, in part because Viṣvāc and his son are only attested here.  Geldner and others understand the poison to be the means by which the Aśvins  destroy the son of Viṣvāc, but if so, such use of poison by the Aśvins is isolated.  Rather, the poison may have given rise to the son of Viṣvāc, an interpretation sup ported by the phonological similarity of viṣvā́c and viṣá. Perhaps the idea is that  Viṣvāc’s son is born from the “poison” of his “double-talking” speech.
