177  
Indra  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Bloomfield (1916: 155) remarks of this hymn, “[It] is certainly late clap-trap. The  jingly use of stems vŕ̥ṣan and vr̥ṣabhá furnishes its main claim to attention. All its  repeated pādas are suspect.” Although we moderns might tend to be less outspo ken, this is certainly one of Agastya’s lesser efforts. The standard tropes of invita tion to the sacrifice (vs. 1ab), journey (vss. 1cd–3), and arrival (vs. 4) are presented  without complexity, and with a certain recycling of vocabulary—not only the “bull”  words scornfully noted by Bloomfield, but also “right up here” (arvā́ṅ vss. 1, 2, 5),  “one such as me” (madrík vss. 1, 3), and the usual lexicon of the journey. The only  really notable feature of the hymn is the first half verse, which uses a number of dif ferent terms to situate Indra in relation to the human populations, while implicitly  asking him to choose us as his destination among these populations.

Indra I.177.1, 3, 4: The appearance of two instances of the gerund yuktvā́and one of niṣádya may be a sign of the hymn’s lateness since the gerund is quite marginal in the RV.
