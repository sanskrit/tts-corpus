68  
Agni  
Parāśara Śāktya  
10 verses: dvipadā virāj  
Breaking the pattern of Parāśara’s previous dvipadā virāj hymns (I.65–67), this one  contains only a single, conventional simile (vs. 9). Its focus is instead on ritual, and  especially on the joint activity performed by “all” in their separate ways and the  rewards they share because of it (see esp. vss. 3, 4, 5, 8, 9). Although the identity of  the “all” is never made explicit, we believe that the poet is depicting the communal  fire shared and jointly tended by the united clans, and that the “all” (víśve) are the  members of the separate clans serving their shared fire (the Vaiśvānara fire [see  Proferes 2007: 46–49 and passim]). In fact, in reading this hymn with its twin, I.69,  the motif of the Vaiśvānara fire emerges strongly. In this hymn the focus is on víśva “all,” in the next hymn on náraḥ “(superior) men,” while at the end of I.70 the two  words are found sequentially (vss. 9–10). These are exactly the two elements found  in the vr̥ddhi bahuvrīhi compound vaiśvānará “belonging to all men,” the very name  of the shared clan fire, a word that never appears in this hymn sequence. Thus, I.68– 70 contain a buried but persistent pun, with one half of the compound allotted to  each of the first two hymns until they are reunited in the third. The phonological  resemblance between víśva “all” and víś “clan” is also in play, though the two words  are etymologically unrelated.

Agni Note that Hoffmann tr. the entire hymn (1967: 141-42) because it contains 10 injunctives. I agree with Hoffmann’s tr. of these forms as presents, although I do not think this requires a Zeitlos-type interpretation.

Agni I consider these three hymns to be thematically and verbally linked, treating the Vaiśvānara fire and encoding this theme by deploying the two words underlying this vṛddhi compound, víśva- and nṛ́-. The first, víśva-, dominates I.68, the second, nṛ́- I.69, and they are juxtaposed in the climactic verses of I.70.9-10. See the introductions to the three hymns in the published translation, and for a detailed discussion, Jamison, Fs. J. S. Klein (“Inter-hymnic Rhetorical Structure in Ṛgveda I.68-70: Parāśara Śāktya’s Vaiśvānara Cycle,” 2016).
