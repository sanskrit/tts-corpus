Dawn  
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa  
13 verses: triṣṭubh  
Another virtuosic Dawn hymn. Here the poet takes the usual generic themes, espe cially Dawn as a beautiful woman, and creates highly specific images, especially in  verses 7–8, which provide a series of almost sociological portraits of ancient Indian  female figures. In verse 7 we first (pāda a) meet a brotherless girl boldly approaching  men; since the brother was important in finding and arranging suitable matches, a  brotherless girl was at a disadvantage in the marriage market and needed to take  initiative on her own. (See Schmidt 1987: 30–75.) The next image is a pun (pāda b),  with one harmless generic image and one shockingly specific one. In the harmless  reading a figure, presumably male, mounts a chariot to seek prizes; in the other a  woman, presumably a prostitute, shows herself off on a platform for money. The  third image (pādas cd) is of the legitimate wife adorned for her husband, but even  there the image shades into that of a loose woman showing her breast. The next  verse (8) treats the common theme of the sisters Dawn and Night, but again Dawn  is presented in a particular female role. In the second pāda, the “girl to be gazed  upon” may well refer to the display motif of the ancient Indian self-choice marriage  (Svayaṃvara; see Jamison 2001), while the “maidens with a choice” may refer to  the same phenomena, girls making their choice of bridegroom at a specially called  assembly (see Jamison 2003).  
Even more striking perhaps is verse 4, where Dawn is compared to three differ ent animals or their parts: she is glossy like the breast of a waterbird who preens it;  

she reveals herself like an elephant kneeling to drink; and she wakens the sleeping  like a fly, buzzing around again and again. (We owe these interpretations to Thieme  1965 [=1971: 214–27].)  
Nothing in the rest of the hymn is quite so quirky, but the standard tropes are  well handled. The common counterpoint between individual Dawn and the multi tude of identical dawns that have preceded and will follow today’s dawn is found  in verses 2–3, 6, and 9. Another common theme, the diversity of beings that Dawn  awakens, appears in verses 1, 6, and 12. The final verses of the hymn raise the hope  of gifts and rewards that will come with the dawn.
