183  
Aśvins  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
A simple and straightforward hymn, especially in comparison with the first  two of Agastya’s Aśvin hymns (I.180–181), almost entirely concerned with  the Aśvins’ chariot and their journey to the sacrifice. In this hymn they travel  with Dawn (vs. 2). The dangers of the journey and their possible neglect of us  are briefly touched on (vs. 4ab), but with little anxiety, before the offerings are  announced to them.
