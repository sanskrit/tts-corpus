Agni  
Havirdhāna Āṅgi  
9 verses: jagatī 1–6, triṣṭubh 7–9  
This hymn, which has some phraseological echoes of X.10 but lacks its mythologi cal content, falls into two metrical parts, which correspond to its thematic structure.  The last three verses (7–9), in triṣṭubh, are fairly straightforward, describing the  benefits that accrue to a mortal who serves the ritual fire and calling on Agni to  bring the divinities to the sacrifice and let it begin.  
The first six verses, in jagatī, are far more complex, and, when viewed as a piece,  without the three triṣṭubh verses at the end, turn out to have an omphalos struc ture: the middle pair of verses (3–4) are parallel in structure, have the phrase agníṃ hótāram “Agni (as) Hotar” opening their final pādas, and together treat both the1384 X.11  
initiation of the current sacrifice and the charter myths for the introduction of the  two ritual substances, fire and soma (with concomitant juggling of verb tenses). In  verse 3 the first sacrificer, Manu, is present at the kindling of the ritual fire; verse 4  sketches the famous tale of the falcon’s theft of soma from heaven.  
The outer verse pairs, 1–2 and 5–6, treat these two substances and their deified  counterparts, fire/Agni and soma/Soma, both simultaneously and in parallel, with  the referent often left unclear. The final verse of this section (6) is especially busy,  with both Agni and Soma actively performing their ritual tasks at the same time  (and perhaps under the same descriptions; see esp. 6c). The tentative identifications  in that verse are made on the basis of the use of the phraseology in other parts of  the R̥gveda. For example, the exact phrase “he trembles with his thought” is used  of Soma in IV.71.3, and the verb translated as “he displays his power” (taviṣyá) in  that same pāda has Soma as its subject in its two other occurrences. However, it is  very likely that the poet expected the audience to consider both possibilities for the  referent in each case and to grasp thereby the underlying commonalities of the two  ritual substances. The first section of the hymn is thus a simpler example of the  conflation of Agni and Soma found in the fiendish hymn V.44.
