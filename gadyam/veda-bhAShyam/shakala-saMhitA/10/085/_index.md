Wedding  
Sūryā Sāvitrī  
47 verses: anuṣṭubh, except triṣṭubh 14, 19–21, 23–24, 26, 36–37, 44; jagatī 18, 27, 43;  urobr̥hatī 34  
This first hymn of the single-hymn group, long and episodic, treats the domes tic ritual of the wedding. Many of the verses are found also in the Atharvaveda  (Śaunaka) wedding hymns (XIV.1–2) and are utilized in the gr̥hya sūtras (the proto cols of the domestic rituals) in the wedding rite.  
It begins (vss. 1–19) with a fairly coherent account of the wedding of Sūryā,  the Daughter of the Sun, whose marriage serves as the prototype of human mar riage. She is also named by the Anukramaṇī as the author of the hymn, a clearly  fanciful ascription. The bridegroom is Soma, and the first five verses are devoted  to asserting that this is not the familiar earthly soma, the ritual drink (see esp. vss.  3–4), but rather the celestial Soma—here identified for the first time as the moon,  an identification that becomes standard later. The waning and waxing of the moon  are referred to in verse 5, and probably cryptically in the first part of verse 4, in the  puzzling adjective “those whose regulation is sheltering” (āchádvidhāna), using an  idiom otherwise used for the regulation of the months and seasons (e.g., in vs. 18).  
The next verses (6–12) employ a style familiar from the Atharvaveda and from  middle Vedic prose, a structured series of identifications between cosmic and every day entities; the everyday entities here are the different features of the wedding, and  especially the wedding vehicle. Much in these verses is unclear for several reasons.  For one thing, workaday language is seldom found in these high-culture texts, and  

so the words for the members of the wedding party and the pieces of the bridal  finery and wedding cart are unfamiliar. Moreover, the cosmic comparanda are dif ficult to penetrate as they seem to refer to unidentified astronomical bodies and  movements. Verses 13–16 focus on a single episode in the marriage ritual, the “woo ing.” Judging from later practice, the bridegroom’s party sends several males to  the potential bride’s home, to ask her father and other male members of the fam ily for her as bride for the man they represent. This part of the ceremony begins  with the wooers identifying themselves by name and lineage—the “pointing out”  of verse 15. In this hymn the Aśvins are the wooers, arriving on their characteristic  three-wheeled chariot, whose wheels provide the topic for a series of (presumably  astronomical) riddles (vss. 15–16). (For further discussion see Jamison 1996a: 222– 24.) After a verse of homage (17), this part of the hymn ends with two further verses  of riddles about the sun and moon (18–19).  
After this long, more-or-less self-contained mythological and cosmological  opening the hymn continues with verses more appropriate to the current, human  wedding. Verses 20–27 contain a somewhat jumbled treatment of the wedding,  from the wooing to the arrival in the new home, beginning with an invitation to  mount the wedding vehicle (vs. 20), perhaps placed here because it has connections  with the Sūryā section. Verses 21–22 are addressed to a Gandharva (a type of lubri  
cious demigod, thought to target unmarried girls), declaring the new wife off-limits.  Verse 23 seems to collapse the earlier journey to the wooing and the journey to the  new home, while the following two verses (24–25) concern the ceremony itself: at  least in the later ritual the wife is briefly bound with a cord, as a symbolic initiation  parallel to the initiation of a young Ārya boy. (See Jamison 1996a: 42–48.) Finally,  in verses 26–27 we reach the journey to the new home and good wishes for the new  mistress of the household.  
Verses 28–35 are a strange, sinister, and menacing interlude between the gener ally happy tone of the first part of the hymn and the blessings with which it closes.  These, especially verses 28–30 and 34–35, are also the most discussed and disputed  verses in the hymn. Let us dispose of the relatively unproblematic verses 31–33 first.  These concern the possible dangers of the wedding journey:  diseases emanating  from the spectators of the procession (vs. 31) and robbers and other hazards (vs.  32). In verse 33 the spectators are allowed to look at the bride and wish her good  luck, but then ordered home.  
It is generally agreed that the three preceding verses (28–30) have to do with the  deflowering of the bride, though there is much disagreement about details. Verse  28, it seems, begins with the announcement of the blood-stained sheet or garment,  the all-important sign that the bride was a virgin. But the rest of this verse and the  two verses following do not treat this as an altogether positive outcome, especially  for the groom. Because the bride was a virgin, the marriage is valid, so her relatives  are pleased (28c)—but the new husband is trapped. The bride becomes a noose  (like the old sexist American slang expression “ball-and-chain” for a wife), and he is  bound in her bonds. She also becomes witchcraft embodied (28b, 29c). In our view this refers to the unnerving and dangerous hold that sex, in the person of his wife,  will exert over the husband. (Compare American English “that old black magic”  for sexual attraction and desire.) He is not only legally but also mentally bound,  and this hold is also expressed by the paradoxical “the wife enters her husband” at  the end of verse 29. Though the sexual act of course happens the other way—hus  
band enters wife—symbolically she enters him: she has penetrated his defenses, got ten “under his skin.” The first half of verse 29 is unconnected with this emotional  transformation; instead it simply continues the legal and social ramifications of the  consummated marriage. With most commentators (pace Falk [1993], who thinks it  is the sable pelt worn by the groom), we interpret the śāmulyàm of 29a as the stained  garment of the bride, now to be disposed of. Pāda b treats the gifts to be given to  the priests who officiated at the ceremony. In verse 30 we return to the groom’s  compromised physical and emotional state: sex, especially this first sex of marriage,  is making him weakened and vulnerable, his naked flesh “glistening in an evil way,”  perhaps with sexual fluids. The theme of the garment found in literal terms in verses  28–29 acquires a somewhat shocking metaphorical twist in the second half of verse  30, where sexual intercourse is depicted as the husband dressing his penis in the  “garment,” that is, the body, of the bride.  
After this emotional binge, the dangers of the road in verses 31–33 seem rather  minor! (The journey verses may have been interpolated here because the diseases of  vs. 31 are reminiscent of the groom’s physical state in vs. 30.) But menace returns in  verse 34, where an unidentified object is ascribed all sorts of harmful qualities. Only  a brahmin can neutralize them. Similarly, in verse 35 various violent actions are  depicted, which a brahmin can absolve. Most commentators have considered the  object in verse 34 to be the stained garment of the bride, and the actions in verse 35  to have been performed on the garment to sanitize it. We think this unlikely; instead  we consider these two verses to concern the wedding feast and in particular the  cow killed for the feast. Just as the sex of verses 28–30 involved violence, surrender,  and the breaking of taboos, so the slaughter of a cow to be eaten at the celebration  requires the same ambivalently viewed actions and in a sense is a public representa tion of the private violation of deflowering. But brahmins who understand “Sūryā,”  that is, the nature of marriage, including its negative qualities, can safely eat the  offered cow.  
Verses 36–37 depict a far more benign husband than the tortured one of verses  28–30 and one more uncomplicatedly eager for sex. These verses lead into the  famous series (38–41) about the previous, divine husbands of the wife. The final  six verses (42–47) are simply expressed blessings of the married couple and of the  new wife.
