‘ रक्षोहणम्' इति पञ्चविंशत्यृचं तृतीयं सूक्तम् । पायुर्नाम भारद्वाज ऋषिः । द्वाविंशाद्याश्चतस्रोऽनुष्टुभः । शिष्टा एकविंशतिस्त्रिष्टुभः । रक्षोहाग्निर्देवता । तथा चानुक्रान्तं -- ‘ रक्षोहणं पञ्चाधिका पायुराग्नेयं राक्षोघ्नं चतुरनुष्टुबन्तम् ' इति । गतः सूक्तविनियोगः । अङ्गाराभिविहरणे ‘परि त्वाग्ने इत्येषा जप्या । सूत्रितं च – धिष्ण्यावताम् ' इत्यादिना ‘परि त्वाग्ने पुरं वयम् ' (आश्व. श्रौ. ५. १३) इत्यन्तेन ॥

Agni Demon-Smiter  
Pāyu Bhāradvāja  
25 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 22–25  
A departure from the usual themes of Agni hymns (though quite reminiscent of the  second half of I.36 and to a lesser extent X.118), this long hymn is entirely devoted  to Agni as “demon-smiter” (rakṣohán), the first word of the hymn, and especially  to his violent pursuit of “sorcerers” (yātudhā́na). The language is gleefully and cre  
atively bloodthirsty, crediting Agni with a large arsenal of weapons, mostly based  on the shape of his flames, and of means of violent destruction of the enemy (pierc ing, crushing, shattering, disemboweling, etc.). The vividness of the language is  enhanced by the fact that, after the first verse, Agni is always addressed in the 2nd  person and almost always with imperatives. (Only vss. 15 and 18 lack direct address  to Agni, though he is lurking in the background. These two verses are also the only  ones in which any other gods are allowed a part of the action.)  
Agni’s connection with ritual is barely mentioned in the hymn. In verse 1 the  poet sprinkles him with ghee, addresses him, and kindles him, in order to ensure his  protection, and in verse 4 it is made clear that the murderous power of Agni’s weap ons comes from the sacrifice and the associated ritual speech. That Agni’s fierce and  aggressive protection of us stems from our ritual behavior toward him should be  kept in mind—though it must be admitted that the poet seems to forget this fact for  long stretches of the hymn.  
Lexical repetition and phonological figures, both simple and complex, are  important features of the style of the hymn. To mention only one of the complex  figures, the unusual participle sphūrjáyan “sizzling” (the only occurrence of this  verb in the R̥gveda) in 11c is echoed phonologically by śaphārújam “hoof-breaking”  in 12b (and to a lesser extent by dhū́rvantam “damaging” in 12d).  
The sheer exuberance of the hymn is contagious, at least to its translators.
