‘वने न वा ' इत्यष्टर्चं त्रयोदशं सूक्तं वसुक्रस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभमैन्द्रम् । अनुक्रान्तं च--- वने नाष्टौ' इति । चतुर्थेऽहनि स्तोमवृद्धौ ब्राह्मणाच्छंसिन एतत्सूक्तमावापार्थम् । सूत्रितं च--' स्तोमे वर्धमाने को अद्य नर्यो वने न वा यः ' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ७. १२) इति । महाव्रते निष्केवल्य एतत्सूक्तम् । सूत्रितं च--- प्र वो महे मन्दमानायान्धस इति निविद्धानं वने न वा यो न्यधायि चाकन्' (ऐ. आ. ५, ३, १) इति ॥

29 (855)  
Indra  
Vasukra Aindra  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Shorter than Vasukra’s other two hymns, but no less daunting in the intricacy of  its expression, especially in verse 1, which displays phonological, morphologi cal, and syntactic tricks too numerous and too dense to discuss in detail here.  (See Jamison [forthcoming c].) Suffice it to say that the verse manages to refer,  by indirection and implication, to the five most important gods at the dawn rit ual: Agni, Indra, Vāyu, and the Aśvins, though only Indra is named. (Dawn is  the sole important divinity absent, but she appears in the first pāda of the next  verse.) Besides the common R̥gvedic habit of employing words applicable to two  or more referents, the verse shows in embryo a device prized in later kāvya: that  of allowing a single phonological sequence to be read in two of more different  ways by means of variant word divisions. Add to this an unprecedented syntactic construction, which is also a syntactic pun, and dizziness ensues for the hearer/ reader.  
The structure and thematic contents of the hymn are less clear than in X.27 and  28, however. After the first two extremely opaque verses, which appear to treat the  dawn ritual and the divine conjunction of Indra and Agni (and probably of the two  Aśvins), the poet turns his hopes and attention to attracting Indra to show himself  at the sacrifice, to produce an epiphany (see esp. vs. 4), through properly performed  offerings. There are a number of obscurities in these verses as well, especially verse  5, and the lack of a perceptible structure hampers our efforts to clarify them. Much  remains to be excavated from this rich poetic mine.
