Agni  
Agni Saucīka or Agni Vaiśvānara  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The most salient feature of this hymn is the form of the word agní that begins every  pāda. In the first half of the hymn (vss. 1–4) the form is almost exclusively nomina tive singular (save for the genitives in 2a and 4d), while the second half has primar ily the accusative. As so often, the final verse breaks the pattern: the first trisyllabic  form (dat. agnáye in 7a) is followed by two vocatives (ágne) in the last hemistich  (7cd), a simple grammatical switch that turns the insistently descriptive 3rd-person  cast of the rest of the hymn into a direct, 2nd-person plea to the god for help and  wealth.  
The actual contents of the hymn are subordinated to this formal structure.  Most of the first half of the hymn is devoted to detailing the gifts and aid that  Agni generally provides, though verse 3 briskly mentions four mythological prec edents where Agni has aided specific individuals, somewhat in the style of the cata logues of good deeds in Aśvin hymns. (In fact, the only reasonably well-known  figure in vs. 3 is Atri [3c], whose rescue is usually attributed to the Aśvins.) Verses  5–6 establish Agni as the target of all creatures in need. In the final verse (7) the  poet both announces his hymn, produced on the model of the R̥bhus, and states  what he wants in return.
