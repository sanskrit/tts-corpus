Muni [the Kesins “Long-Haired Ones”] ́  
Vātaraśana’s seven sons, the munis Jūti 1, Vātajūti 2, Viprajūti 3, Vrṣḁ̄ ṇaka 4,  Karikrata 5, Etaśa 6, R̥śyaśrṅ̥ ga 7  
7 verses: anuṣṭubh  
This short hymn about the long-haired (keśin) ascetic (muni) has gained a certain  measure of fame as an apparent precursor of later extreme ascetic practices and  of the Rudra-Śiva cult (based especially on the mention of Rudra in the last verse,  where the ascetic drinks an apparent cultic substance in company with Rudra).  From the R̥gvedic point of view its closest analogue is the Labasūkta (X.119),  describing the sensations of a soma-drinker, with its refrain “Have I drunk of the  soma? Yes!” Both hymns depict the experience as flight, especially flight sped by the  wind (here see vss. 2–6) and affording a bird’s eye view of the earth and its inhabit ants (here vs. 4–5), and also emphasize the subject’s sense of power over cosmic  entities (here esp. vss. 1, 5).  
The difference seems to be the identity of the drink that produces these sensa tions: soma in I.119, “poison” (viṣá) in this hymn. The mention of the latter sub stance begins and ends this hymn (vss. 1a, 7c) in ring composition. It is unclear what  the liquid in question is. However, it should be noted that the drinker himself/itself  is provided with characteristic somian vocabulary (“sweet, most exhilarating”) in  the last pāda (6d) before the final verse depicting the preparation and drinking of  the poison, and furthermore that the preparation of this poison by churning/stir ring (√manth) and crushing (√piṣ) seems to mimic the preparation of soma: “crush”  is semantically close to “press” (√su), and a certain type of soma, mixed with meal,  is technically called manthín. The prominence of the wind-god Vāyu (vss. 5, 7) is  also reminiscent of the soma sacrifice, for Vāyu, along with Indra, is the first recipi ent of the soma drink. Thus, the cultic practice here is either being presented as a  mirror-image analogue of the orthodox soma sacrifice, or in fact is the soma sacri fice, but in esoteric guise.
