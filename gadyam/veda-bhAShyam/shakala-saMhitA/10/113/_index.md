दशमेऽनुवाके षोडश सूक्तानि । तत्र ‘ तमस्य' इति दशर्चं प्रथम सूक्तमैन्द्रम् । शतप्रभेदनो नाम वैरूप ऋषिः । अन्त्या त्रिष्टुप् शिष्टा जगत्यः । तथा चानुक्रान्तं -- तमस्य शतप्रभेदनस्त्रिष्टुबन्तम् । इति । दशरात्रस्याष्टमेऽहनि मरुत्वतीय एतत्सूक्तम् । सूत्रितं च - ‘ तमस्य द्यावापृथिवी महाँ इन्द्रो नृवदिति मरुत्वतीयम्' (आश्व. श्रौ. ६, ७) इति ॥

Indra  
Śataprabhedana Vairūpa  
10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10  
Indra’s great deeds, especially the smiting of Vr̥tra (vss. 2–3, 6–8), are once again  the subject of this hymn, but the emphasis is on the other gods who contributed to  the success of Indra’s exploits: Heaven and Earth (vs. 1), Viṣṇu (vs. 2), Mitra and  Varuṇa (vs. 5), and especially the Maruts (vss. 2–3, 6). In depicting these various  partnerships between Indra and various gods, the poet is establishing the model  for a similar relationship between Indra and the present poets and sacrificers. In  verse 8 he attributes to “all the gods” the ritual strengthening of Indra by means of  praise poetry and soma—an exact parallel to mortals’ standard activity on behalf  of Indra. In the first half of verse 9 in rather labored language he then addresses  his fellow priest-poets, urging them to spell out to Indra their mutual acts of  partnership—and providing in the second half of the verse a mythic example of  Indra’s aid to a mortal in return for hospitality. (Dabhīti’s hospitality to Indra and  Indra’s requital of it by rendering Dabhīti’s enemies Dhuni and Cumuri powerless  are recounted elsewhere; see, e.g., VI.20.13 and VI.26.6.) Finally in verse 10 he  addresses Indra directly, requesting goods from him. Interestingly, it seems that  the poet is not asking for these goods for himself, but presumably for his patron,  so that the patron in turn will consider the poet a successful wordsmith and reward  him appropriately.
