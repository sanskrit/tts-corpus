Agni  
Trita Āptya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  

The most salient characteristic of the hymn is its concern with the ritual sequence  (r̥tú) and with Agni as the god who ensures that these sequences are properly  arranged and performed. In this feature it reminds us of the hymns devoted to the  r̥tugrahas (the offering of “sequential cups” to an ordered set of divinities by an  ordered series of priests); see I.15 and II.36–37. Although our hymn has much in  common with those hymns, it does not provide the complete series, as those hymns  do. Instead it focuses on Agni as the Hotar and the central figure in the sacrificial  program—the senior partner, as it were, in the ritual enterprise involving both Agni  and mortals as officiants. Agni’s most important quality in this hymn is knowl edge: he is called vidvā́n (or pravidvā́n) “knowing” four times in the hymn (vss. 1,  3, 4, 7), and “discerning” (vijānán) once (vs. 5). The epithet we have translated as  “Establisher of Thought” in verse 2 (mandhātár) probably also participates in this  theme, since it is etymologically almost identical to the name of the chief divinity in  the Old Iranian pantheon, Ahura Mazdā, “Lord Wisdom” (← Proto Indo-Iranian  *mn̥s-dhaH). Mortals, by contrast, are very un-knowing (áviduṣṭara, vs. 4)  and  prone to moral and ritual mistakes (vss. 4–5).  
Less prominent in the hymn, but noteworthy because of the importance of this  theme later in the Xth Maṇḍala, is the distinction between the path going to the  gods (vs. 3)  and that to the forefathers (vs. 7), which figures prominently in the  funeral hymns (X.14–18).
