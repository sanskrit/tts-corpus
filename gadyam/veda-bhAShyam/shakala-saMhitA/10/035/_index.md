‘अबुध्रम् ' इति चतुर्दशर्चं षष्ठं  सूक्तं धनाकपुत्रस्य लुशस्यार्षम् । इदमुत्तरं च वैश्वदेवम् । त्रयोदशीचतुर्दश्यौ त्रिष्टुभौ शिष्टा द्वादश जगत्यः । तथा चानुक्रान्तम् -- अबुध्रं लुशो धानाको वैश्वदेवं तु द्वित्रिष्टुबन्तं तु ' इति । गतः सूक्तविनियोगः । एकादशिनस्य वैश्वदेवस्य पशोर्वपायागस्यानुवाक्या  ‘ विश्वे अद्य' इत्येषा । सूत्रितं च --- विश्वे अद्य मरुतो विश्व ऊत्या नो देवानामुप वेतु शंसः' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ३. ७) इति ॥

All Gods  
Luśa Dhānāka  
14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 13–14  
This is primarily a morning hymn, calling especially on the gods associated with  the early morning sacrifice for aid and protection: the Sun, the Dawn, Agni, Indra,  the Aśvins, as well as Heaven and Earth. The ten interior verses (3–12) have a pāda length refrain dedicated to the kindled ritual fire, and the activities of Dawn occupy  much of the hymn (esp. vss. 3–6). The hymn opens out toward its end, with special  focus on the Ādityas (vss. 9, 11–12), but the later prominence of the Ādityas has  been prepared by mention of “blamelessness” in earlier verses (2–3) and by the  “proclamation of truth” in verse 8. This truth, formulated in 8c, is simply that “the  Sun, as spy,” rises every day, but we know from elsewhere in the R̥gveda (nearby X.37  belonging to the same poetic group [see discussion there], as well as, e.g., VII.62.2,  VII.63.1) that the Sun is the eye of the Ādityas, especially Mitra and Varuṇa, who  attests to the innocence or guilt of the men whom he sees as he rises. Thus this brief  truth formulation encapsulates our knowledge that our place in the moral order is  mediated through the cosmic order of the daily rhythm of sunrise.
