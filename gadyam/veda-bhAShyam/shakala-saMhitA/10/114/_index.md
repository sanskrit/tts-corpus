Sadhri Vairūpa or Gharma Tāpasa  
10 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 4  
A mystical treatment of the sacrifice, whose mysteries unfortunately remain for the  most part unsolved, despite many attempts to identify the referents and relation ships of the striking images presented. We will not here add another, most likely  doomed, experiment in exegesis, although some possible referents are inserted in  brackets below. What is clear is that the elements in the ritual and elements in the  

cosmic world are identified with each other (in the style of the bandhus, or mysti cal identifications, so characteristic of middle Vedic literature), but by way of a  mediating esoteric image that can apply to both (at least to “those who know”).  This style is especially evident in the first verses of the hymn, while numerology  comes more and more to dominate the later verses. Indeed, significant numbers are  found from the very beginning (the two heats of vs. 1, the three dissolutions of vs.  2, the four braids and two eagles of vs. 3), but the manipulation of numbers begins  in earnest with verses 4–5. These same two verses contrast the poet with his “simple  mind,” who sees only one entity (vs. 4), with the inspired ones and sage poets (vs.  5), who use their words to make that single entity manifold. Even though many of  the details of this enigmatic hymn remain obscure, we can see in this contrast the  inherent message of the hymn, that insight and its verbal product, poetry, have the  power to give shape and multiplicity to the perceptible world.
