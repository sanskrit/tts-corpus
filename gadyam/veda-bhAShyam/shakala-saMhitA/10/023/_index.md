Indra  
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukr̥t Vāsukra  
7 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 1, 7; abhisāriṇī 5 (so Anukramaṇī)  
The hymn begins with a fine Indo-Iranian opening “we sacrifice to/worship  (yájāmahe) Indra,” reminiscent of the Younger Avestan litanies with the identical  verb yazamaide. The praise of Indra that follows is fairly conventional; we hear of  his mace (vss. 1, 3), his pair of fallow bays (vss. 1–3), and, less usually, his beard (vss.  1, 3). He is portrayed, in contrastive but complementary fashion, as at once warrior  and generous and paternal patron (see, e.g., vss. 1d, 2b, 5).  
The final two verses (6–7) mention the poet Vimada (7b) and his family (6a),  and both verses feature prominently the verb vidmā́ “we know,” a partial anagram  of this name. Indra’s name is also played upon, in the adjective iná “strong” (6c),  and possibly, earlier in the hymn, by the presence of several pleonastic+++(=redundant)+++ occurrences  of the particle íd (3a, 4d). In the same spirit, the frequent occurrence of the pre  
verb/particle ví seems designed to recall the Vimada name. This punning is more  subtle and varied than that found in the Vimada hymns with the repeated catch word refrain ví vo máde ... vívakṣase (X.21, 24.1–3, 25). Thus, though the contents  of the praise are conventional, the playful phonological complexity gives texture to  the poem.
