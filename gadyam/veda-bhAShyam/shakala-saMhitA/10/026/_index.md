‘ प्र हि' इति नवर्चं दशमं सूक्तमानुष्टुभं पूषदेवताकम् । आद्याचतुर्थ्यावुष्णिहौ। ऋषिः पूर्ववत् । तथा चानुक्रान्तं -- प्र हि नव पौष्णमानुष्टुभमाद्याचतुर्थ्या उष्णिहौ' इति । गतो विनियोगः ॥

Pūsaṇ  
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra  
9 verses: anuṣṭubh, except uṣṇih 1, 4  
Unlike most treatments of Pūṣan in the R̥gveda, with their generally simple but  lively and colloquial language and concentration on Pūṣan’s mundane activities,  this hymn is bristling with difficulties, oddly constructed hapax compounds, and  high, though frequently unclear, sentiments. See especially verse 6, whose language  and intent are almost entirely obscure.  
The general themes are Pūṣan’s reciprocal relationship with inspired poets and  their thoughts (see vss. 1–2, 4–5) and his role as companion and friend (see vss.  2, 5–8).
