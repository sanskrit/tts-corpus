Indra  
Gaurivīti Śaktyā  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
Although attributed to the same poet as the last hymn and also dedicated to  Indra, this hymn fortunately lacks the challenges that X.73 poses—and in fact  takes awhile to get to Indra. The first three verses simply announce the poet’s  intention to praise the gods and ask them to travel to the sacrifice with goods  to bestow. The last three verses (4–6) turn to Indra exclusively, suggesting first  in verse 4, via an allusion to the Vala myth and, possibly, to the Maruts’ mother1504 X.75  
Pr̥śni, the sacrificers’ desire for cows and sons. More praise for Indra follows in  verses 5–6, with the final pāda (6d) expressing the expectation that Indra will  fulfill our desires.
