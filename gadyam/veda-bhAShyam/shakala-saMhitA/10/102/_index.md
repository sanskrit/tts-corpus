The Race of Mudgala and Mudgalānı̄  
Mudgala Bhārmyaśva  
12 verses: triṣṭubh, except br̥hatī 1, 3, 12  
We two translators have differing interpretations of some of the details and more  especially of the ritual application of this hymn. These contrasting views are set out  in separate signed discussions in the following introduction.  
SWJ  
This famous and famously enigmatic hymn presents an intriguing scenario: a char iot race (or a chariot drive) in which a man named Mudgala decisively wins the  stakes, with the help of Indra, despite using unorthodox equipment and personnel  that seem destined to fail him. His charioteer is his wife Mudgalānī (see vs. 2) and  the team drawing the chariot seems to consist of a boisterous and ill-controlled bull  yoked with an inert piece of wood (see esp. vss. 9–10). Or so is our best guess; the  depiction of the race is oblique and narratively shattered.  
Not surprisingly the hymn has provoked much discussion, both about the bare  “facts” of the chariot race and about the meaning and purpose of the hymn as a  whole. There are two major and interconnected thematic strands motivating the  hymn, and these converge in the figure of Mudgalānī and are expressed especially  clearly in verse 11, where Mudgalānī recovers her husband, and the pair burgeon  with apparent fertility—he “dripping” and she “swelling.” She is there also identi  
fied as a “(once) avoided wife,” in later śrauta ritual a technical term for one of the  king’s wives, avoided presumably because she failed to produce offspring. So, on  

one level the hymn depicts the recovery of fertility and the future production of  offspring in Mudgala’s line. The hovering presence and aid of the hyper-virile Indra  and the emphasis throughout the hymn (see esp. vss. 4–6) on his animal stand-in,  the bull pulling the chariot, reinforces this message. Mudgalānī’s sexual nature is  suggested by our first glimpse of her, with the wind lifting her garment (vs. 2a), and  in a particularly startling verse (6) the droppings of the defecating bull keep hitting  the woman who is driving him—an image that suggests, as it subverts, sexual con  
tact between the bull and the woman. If this bull stands in for Indra, its yokemate,  the wooden club, may represent an impotent Mudgala, and the announcement in  verse 10 that the wooden club has now been “made to mount” may signal that  Mudgala has, paradoxically, recovered his sexual potency by association with the  bull/Indra.  
The other thematic strand is a ritual one. In my opinion this hymn takes part in  the disguised dialogue in the late R̥gveda about the ritual innovation, the introduc tion of the Sacrificer’s Wife, the ritual patnī, into solemn sacrificial practice. As  we have discussed elsewhere, various hymns and sections thereof seem to favor or  oppose this innovation, but always in the guise of another discourse. This hymn  seems strongly in favor of the introduction of the patnī. It begins with a pun, whose  implications are worked out through the rest of the hymn. The first pāda of the  hymn introduces Mudgala’s chariot, which is mithūkŕ̥tam. This word is generally  translated “wrongly functioning, falsely made” or the like, and that is surely one of  its implications here: the chariot is defective. But it can also mean “making/forming  a sexual pair,” and this is a very apt description of the new ritual model, with the  Sacrificer and his Wife the pair associated with the chariot, a common metaphor for  the sacrifice. The rest of hymn can be read as an extended metaphorical treatment  of the new ritual model, using the same image of the sacrifice as chariot—with the  Wife is charioteer, not yokemate of the Sacrificer as in some other contributions  to the discussion (see, e.g., VIII.33.18). The emphasis throughout the hymn on the  unorthodox and makeshift nature of the equipment and the surprising outcome  in victory signals that the ritual partnership between husband and wife is a new,  untried model, which nonetheless brings even more success than the old one. The  happy outcome of the hymn, the recovery of her husband and the swelling fertility  of Mudgalānī (vs. 11), reminds us of the relentless stress on the Wife’s raison d’être  in classical śrauta ritual as representative of sexuality and fertility in all their forms  (see Jamison 1996a: esp. ch. 3, sect. C–E).  
JPB  
Alternatively, the hymn may have been composed to accompany a rite of niyoga,  in which a surrogate is appointed as a substitute for an impotent or dead husband.  Mudgala is the dead or impotent husband, but Mudgalānī has been able win off spring for him by finding a “bull,” a potent man, who can impregnate her and secure the continuation of Mudgala’s lineage. In this interpretation, the “wooden club” in  verse 9 is a symbol of the potency of the surrogate, rather than the impotence of  Mudgala, especially if the “racecourse” in the middle of which it lies is a figure for  the body of Mudgalānī. Verse 6 provides a possible clue to the application of this  hymn. If the praise of Indra in verse 12 is taken as extra-hymnic, verse 6 is the center  of the hymn, the place where the secrets of hymn are often disclosed (or buried even  more deeply). It begins kakárdave vr̥ṣabhó yuktá āsīt. Unfortunately, as noted below,  the meaning of kakárdave is uncertain. (It might be dative “for making kaka” as  translated below, but it might also be locative “in the creaking one,” referring to the  cart driven by Mudgalānī.) But the rest of the pāda is simple and clear: “the bull was  yoked.” Again in pāda c, the poet repeats that the bull was “yoked.” The reason for  poet’s insistence on this detail may be that yuktá “yoked” in this key verse points to  the etymologically related “niyoga,” the hymn’s ritual context.
