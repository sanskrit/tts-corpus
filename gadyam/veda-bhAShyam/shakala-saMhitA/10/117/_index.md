Praise of Generosity [dhanānnadānaprasaḿ ̣sā]  
Bhikṣu Āṅgirasa  
9 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1–2  
Unusual in both subject matter and tone. This hymn has no divine dedicand, but in  the Anukramaṇī is termed a “praise of the gift of wealth and food.” There is, in fact,  almost no mention of divinities or divine powers in the hymn, an almost unique situ ation in the R̥gveda; the gods figure only in the first verse and there only obliquely.  The emphasis is instead on the mutual relations between humans (comradeship; see,  esp., vss. 3–4, 6) and the obligation of the fortunate to provide for those in need.  Insofar as the R̥gveda treats the ethical responsibilities of men, ethical behavior is  ordinarily mediated through the gods, especially Mitra and Varuṇa, but here there  is no such mediation: the admonitions to behave properly to one’s fellow men are  direct and no gods are represented as observing and judging human behavior.  
The argument for generosity is twofold and is couched not in purely ethical  terms, but in terms of self-interest. On the one hand, giving does not do the giver  any harm, as his stores do not become depleted. This sentiment is expressed most  clearly in verse 1c, but it seems also to underlie the maxim-like verses 7 and 8. Verse  7 seems to be a version of the slightly vulgar English expression “use it or lose it,”  while verse 8 suggests that sheer quantity isn’t the measure of power and effective  
ness: the more “feet” an entity has, the less its autonomy and power. On the other  hand, not giving does the ungenerous man actual harm. In part, the harm is simply  the isolation produced by not acting in a comradely manner. As verse 6 says suc cinctly, “who eats alone has only evil.” But it is also the case that one’s fortunes can  change (see esp. vs. 5). Those who are rich and well fed today may find themselves  in need in the future, and it is best to forge comradely ties by giving now, in case the  situations of giver and receiver are reversed.  
The tone of the hymn is colloquial and conversational. A  number of verses  deploy what appear to be old sayings or popular adages, distilled folk wisdom,  whose pertinence to the topic at hand is indirect and requires some figuring out.  Because of their rarity in the high-register texts of early Vedic, such expressions are  very precious, though they can be hard to penetrate. The Anukramaṇī identifies the poet as Bhikṣu (“beggar”) Āṅgirasa, a name pre sumably suggested after the fact by the subject matter, especially since the word  bhikṣu, though very common and culturally important in later times, does not occur  in the R̥gveda or indeed any Vedic text that we know of.
