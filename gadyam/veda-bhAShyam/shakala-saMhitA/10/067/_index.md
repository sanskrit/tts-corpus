Br̥haspati  
Ayāsya Āṅgirasa  
12 verses: triṣṭubh  
This is perhaps the clearest treatment of Br̥haspati’s role in the Vala myth and of  his identity with Indra, the usual hero in the Vala story. As discussed above (see  especially the introduction to IV.50), Hanns-Peter Schmidt (1968) has clearly shown  that bŕ̥haspáti was originally an epithet of Indra in his role as priest and formulator,  a role that is highlighted in the Vala myth—since Indra opens the Vala cave and  frees the cows not with his normal power and violence but with song and correctly  crafted verbal formulae. In this hymn Br̥haspati is credited with the deed, but in  equivalence with Indra. The names are essentially superimposed upon each other,  an equation made more obvious by their positioning: the name Br̥haspati opens  the second half-verse of verses 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and the more transparent version  of his name, Brahmaṇaspati, is in the same position in verse 7. In the midst of this  sequence, in the middle verse 6, we find Indra in initial position in the verse and  credited with the same deed. The poet could hardly have made their identity clearer.  (The final verse of the hymn [12] begins with the word Indra, here as hero of other  stories, especially the Vr̥tra myth.)  
The hymn begins (vs. 1) with the primal finding and production of a true insight;  the unidentified “fourth one” in the second half of the verse probably refers to  the fourth, inaudible portion of speech, or the fourth formulation, which figures  prominently in Vedic speculations on the nature and power of speech (see Jamison  1991: 251–57). The second verse introduces the Aṅgirases, the crucial partners of  Br̥haspati/Indra in the opening of the Vala cave; they too find the truthful word.  The next five verses (3–8) narrate the dramatic opening of the cave and the freeing  of the cows. One notes a certain irony in the poet’s treatment of Vala: though the  cave is first depicted as a fetter (vs. 4) and a stronghold (vs. 5), it is described with  the ambiguous term “guard” in verse 6 (a term as ambiguous in Sanskrit as it is in English), and then with a more sarcastic tone “cow-nurturer” in verse 7 and “cow herd” in verse 8.  
The hymn ends with four verses celebrating the god and asking for blessings.  Most interesting in this section is the final pāda of verse 10 (if we have rightly  interpreted it), which alludes to the different poetic skills and styles of the mortal  celebrants.
