‘ अभ्रप्रुषः' इत्यष्टर्चं नवमं सूक्तं भृगुगोत्रस्य स्यूमरश्मेरार्षं मरुद्देवताकम् । पञ्चमी जगती शिष्टाः सप्त त्रिष्टुभः । तथा चानुक्रान्तम् - अभ्रप्रुषः स्यूमरश्मिर्भार्गवो मारुतं तु पञ्चमी जगती  इति । गतो विनियोगः ॥

Maruts  
Syūmaraśmi Bhārgava  
8 verses: triṣṭubh (and mangled jagatī)  
On the metrical structure, see the introduction just above.  
Rhetorically the hymn (through vs. 5)  is dominated by similes, often studied  and syntactically complex ones, with three or four similes in every verse. When the  dense concentration of similes ends (beginning with vs. 6), the meter returns to con ventional triṣṭubh and to conventional hymn-ending expressions of hope for favor.  
Most of the descriptions of the Maruts, however contorted their syntax, belong  to the familiar repertoire of Marut characteristics: their stormy nature, their asso ciation with Indra, their beauty and ornaments, their boisterousness. However,  twice they are connected with the Ādityas (vss. 2d, 8b), a group of gods with which  they generally have nothing in common. This connection is puzzling. Thieme  (1938: 158) suggests that their common quality was “caring for the stranger” (if that  is what the disputed word ríśādas, also found twice in the hymn [vss. 3, 5], means).
