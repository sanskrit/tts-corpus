### Miscellaneous character  
The Xth maṇḍala consists of 191 hymns like Maṇḍala I, but it has a more miscellaneous character and looser organization than its twin. As a whole, X was certainly  the final addition to the codified R̥gveda, and it contains many hymns with younger  linguistic features and “popular” themes, or at least subjects that were not central to  the soma sacrifice that dominates the rest of the R̥gveda and determines the choice  of hymns to be included or excluded in the rest of the text. These include life-cycle  rituals like the funeral and the wedding, meta-reflections on the sacrifice and its  parts, additional mythological material, celebrations of deities and divine forces  peripheral to the soma sacrifice, dramatic monologues and dialogues, healing spells  and curses, and so forth. However, it is easy to overemphasize the special character  of X, for, when compared even with the chronologically close Atharvaveda, the  intricate, playful, and allusive style, the lexicon, and the complex development of  themes of most of X are quite distinctively R̥gvedic.  

### Groupings  
Approximately half the maṇḍala is organized into collections generally attributed to individual poets. The first few of these collections are comparable in number of hymns to those in I, but starting with X.61 the hymns are arranged first in  pairs (61–84) and then, beginning with X.85, as individual hymns.  

This maṇḍala contains too many striking hymns, famous or unsung, to list here.  The reader is referred to the introductions to the individual collections and hymns.  

The first nine hymns of Maṇḍala X are assigned to two different poets: Trita Āptya  1–7 and Triśiras Tvāṣṭra (“Three-Headed Son of Tvaṣṭar”) 8–9. Both of these are  mythological figures, who appear as opponents in the same myth, which is narrated  briefly at the end of X.8. Although the poets’ names were generated from the mythological material and therefore do not reflect “real” poets, it is clear from their narrative connection that the hymns belong together (Oldenberg 1888: 232–35). All of the Trita Āptya hymns (1–7) and the first two-thirds of X.8 are dedicated  to Agni. The last three verses of X.8 (7–9), where the myth of the confrontation of  Trita Āptya and his three-headed opponent is narrated, is assigned to Indra by the  Anukramaṇī. The final hymn (X.9) is to the Waters.
