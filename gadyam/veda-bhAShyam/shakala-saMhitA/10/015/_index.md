Śaṅkha Yāmāyana  
14 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 11  
This hymn is simply an expansion on the invitation in the last hymn (X.14.4–6) to  the forefathers to come to our sacrifice. They are repeatedly urged to sit on the ritual  grass, to partake of the offerings, including soma, and to provide us with material  and spiritual benefits in return. The language is quite straightforward, with very  few verbal tricks. Only in verse 3 do we encounter a turn of phrase that invites  our inquiry: in the first half of the verse “I” find not only the forefathers on the  ritual ground but also “the grandson/child” (nápāt) and the “stride of Viṣṇu.” The  “grandson” may be a reference to Agni, often called “child of strength” (ū́rjo nápāt)  and also frequently identified with the “Child of the Waters” (Apām Napāt), but  it may also and simultaneously refer to the various descendants of the returning  forefathers, descendants who would be present at the ritual and serving at it. As for  Viṣṇu’s wide stride, most commentators take this as the highest heaven, that is, the  last of Viṣṇu’s three strides. But it is hard to understand how this would be found  “here”; we think rather that it refers to Viṣṇu’s first stride, which measures out the  earth, and in this case that it is a specific reference to the delineated sacrificial space.  
Toward the end of the hymn, the god Agni becomes prominent (vss. 9–14) and  his special relationship with the forefathers—as their cremation fire—is alluded to  (esp. vss. 11, 14).
