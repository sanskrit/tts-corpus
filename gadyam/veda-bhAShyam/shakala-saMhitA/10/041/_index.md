Suhastya Ghauṣeya  
3 verses: jagatī  
As we already noted in the introduction to this group of hymns, this brief appendix  is a conventional journey hymn. Nothing in this hymn, save the treatment of the  chariot in verse 1, makes its relationship to the two preceding Ghoṣā hymns evident.  The poet is identified as a son of Ghoṣā by the metronymic Ghauṣeya; his first  name, Suhastya “Good-handed,” is extracted from verse 3.
