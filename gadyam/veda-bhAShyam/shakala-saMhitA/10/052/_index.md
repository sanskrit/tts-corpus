‘विश्वे देवाः शास्तन' इति षडृचं दशमं सूक्तं सौचीकस्याग्नेरार्षं वैश्वदेवम् । गतः सूक्तविनियोगः । स्रुगादापनात्पूर्वभाविनि जपे विनियुक्ता। सूत्रितं च - ‘ विश्वे देवाः शास्तन मा यथेहाराधि होता निषदा यजीयान् ' ( आश्व. श्रौ. १. ४ ) इति ॥

Address to the Gods from Agni  
Agni Saucīka  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn logically follows the preceding one. Agni has agreed to accept the  Hotarship, which he had originally fled. He ceremonially requests guidance from  the gods about how to perform his new duties in verses 1–2.  
The middle verse (3) seems not to be spoken by Agni, but rather by a mortal  attending or officiating at the sacrifice and catching sight of the newly installed  Agni. In the first half of the verse he expresses some anxiety about this fire’s con nection to Yama; at issue is the possible confusion between, or identity of, the  new ritual fire with the cremation fire, which conveys the dead to Yama’s realm.  (Similar anxiety is treated in the funeral hymns, especially X.16.) Reassurance  seems to be dispensed in the second half of the verse; it may be (following Lanman  1884: 388) that the daily rebirth is that of the Agnihotra fire, while the monthly  rebirth is for the Śrāddha, or ceremony in honor of the dead—allowing separation  of the two fires and their functions.  
In verses 4–5 Agni quotes the gods’ words as they install him (4cd), and prom ises to fulfill his duties in exemplary fashion. The final verse (6) sums up the gods’  installation of Agni.
