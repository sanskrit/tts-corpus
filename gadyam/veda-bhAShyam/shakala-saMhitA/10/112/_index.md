Indra  
Nabhaḥprebhedana Vairūpa  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
A conventional invitation to the soma-drinking, specifically that of the Morning  Pressing (see esp. vs. 1). As usual, Indra is urged to travel to our sacrifice with his  pair of horses (esp. vss. 2, 4) and to drink the soma, whose serving is described. Also  as often, the rival sacrificers who try to tempt Indra to their soma are mentioned  and the superior charms of our offerings are touted (vs. 7). The poet also promises a  verbal performance celebrating Indra’s deeds to accompany the soma offering (vs. 8,  also vs. 1), and a very abbreviated précis of the Vala myth is given in the second half  of verse 8. The final verse (10) expresses our hopes for Indra’s reciprocal generosity.
