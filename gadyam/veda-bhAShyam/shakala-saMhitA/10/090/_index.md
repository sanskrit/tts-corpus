Purusạ  
Nārāyaṇa  
16 verses: anuṣṭubh, except triṣṭubh 16  

This is one of the best-known and most influential hymns of the R̥gveda. Its central  symbol is the púruṣa, the “man,” “person,” or “human being.” 

On the surface, this hymn tells of the sacrifice of a giant man, from whose parts the world was created.  The theme of creation through a cosmic sacrifice is widespread, but this hymn is  not simply the retelling of an ancient tradition. The púruṣa here serves as a symbol  of the sacrifice itself, which especially in the middle Vedic tradition is a locus of creative power. The púruṣa is thus similar to the later divine figure Prajāpati, who in the  Brāhmaṇas personifies the sacrifice. 

Indeed this late hymn represents a verse commentary on the sacrifice that prefigures the prose commentaries of the Brāhmaṇas.+++(5)+++  

This hymn is also notable because it is the only R̥gvedic mention of the four varṇas,  the hierarchical division of the social order that forms the theoretical basis for the  caste system. One reason that the hymn may have been included in the R̥gveda to  provide a R̥gvedic charter for such a division of society.  

The identity of the Man and the sacrifice is established in the opening verse, for  his thousand heads, eyes, and feet recall Agni, the sacrificial fire, and his macro cosmic equivalent, the Sun (cf. Brown 1931: 109–10). The Man comprehends the  earth and extends beyond it. As Mus (1968: 549) has pointed out, the “ten-fingers’  breadth” by which he exceeds the world measures from the Man’s hairline to his  mouth.+++(4)+++ The Man’s mouth represents speech, which marks the boundary between  the imperceptible world of thought and the perceptible world created by speech.+++(5)+++ 

His  mouth is also associated with eating, and in verse 2 the Man rises beyond the world  “through food,” that is, by making the world his food. In later texts the “eater” is the  master and the “eaten” is one who benefits the master (cf. Rau 1957: 34–35). The  image may therefore reflect the Man’s dominance over the world.+++(4)+++ See also X.125,  in which the mouth is similarly both the locus of speech and the locus of eating.

This theme of dominance or rule continues also in verse 5 in the mutual generation of the Man and the Virāj. The word virā́j can mean either “brilliant” or “ruling,  rule.” The latter is the more likely sense here, and therefore this word connects the  hymn to Vedic ideals of the king, who in his consecration encompasses the world in  a similar way that the Man does here (Proferes 2007: esp. ch. 3). Since the term virā́j is grammatically feminine, it complements púruṣa, which is masculine in grammar  and connotation.+++(4)+++  

The Man is the “offering” (vs. 6), the sacrificial victim (vs. 15), but more especially he is the sacrifice itself that the gods, the Sādhyas, and seers performed  (vs. 7). Through this sacrifice the elements of subsequent sacrifices emerged: the  “clotted-mixture” (vs. 8), the verses, chants, meters, and sacrificial formulae (vs.  9), and the sacrificial animals (vs. 10). The parts of the sacrifice also became the  three upper varṇas (vss. 11–12): his mouth the brahmins, masters of knowledge and  speech; his arms the rulers, the possessors of power; and his thighs the freemen or  clansmen, who are the productive support of society. These three classes form parts  of the sacrifice because they can participate in the sacrifice. The śūdras or “servants”  are not part of the sacrifice but rather emerge from the feet of the Man, a symbol  of their low social status and their exclusion from the sacrifice. Finally, the elements  of the cosmos and gods themselves come forth from the sacrifice (vss. 13–14). This  primeval sacrifice thus establishes the “first foundations” for the performance of the sacrifice or even for the ritual, social, divine, and visible worlds more generally (vs.  16ab), and it creates access to heaven (16cd).  

The identity of the Sādhyas (in vss. 7 and 16) is not clear. Their name means  “those to be brought to success,” and they appear to be ancient sacrificers whose  proper ritual performance has “perfected” them and who have attained god-like  status or the status of gods.+++(4)+++
