Savitar  
Arcat Hairaṇyastūpa  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The poet of this hymn is identified by the Anukramaṇī as a descendant of  Hiraṇyastūpa, and in the last verse (6) the poet compares his own invocation of  Savitar with that of Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa, who, in fact, appears in the Anukramaṇī as the author of I.31–35 and IX.4 and 6—with I.35 also a hymn to Savitar. Thus this  hymn may be making a cross reference to another hymn in the samḥitā. Although  there are no blatant links between the two hymns, both are concerned with the  divisions of the cosmos and Savitar’s relationship to them. In this hymn especially  Savitar’s cosmogonic role is highlighted.
