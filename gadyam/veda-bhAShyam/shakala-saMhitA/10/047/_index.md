Indra  
Saptagu Āṅgirasa  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Though the Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn to a different poet from the last two,  structural considerations make it clear that it belongs with X.45–46, as Oldenberg  convincingly argues (1888:  236); the Anukramaṇī has simply extracted the name  Saptagu Āṅgirasa from verse 6, where it is properly applied to the god Br̥haspati.  Nonetheless, the subject matter of this hymn is quite distinct from the two Agni  hymns that precede it: it is a naked demand to Indra for wealth. The hymn has a  superficially monotonous structure consisting of attributes in the accusative: verses  2–5 form a single sentence dependent on the second hemistich of 1. But this monot ony conceals, or rather reveals, the poet’s cleverness, for it is entirely ambiguous  whether the accusatives modify Indra or the “wealth” of the refrain found in all the  d-pādas. In the former case, the adjectives would agree with the accusative tvā in the  verb phrase found in 1c vidmā́ hí tvā “for we know you (as),” punctuated and inter  
rupted by the syntactically unconnected refrain; in the latter case with the accusative  rayím in the refrain. The semantics of the predicate adjectives in these verses would  allow either, sometimes slightly tipped toward one or the other. It may seem that  the question is settled finally in verse 5, where we encounter the first noun—vā́jam  
“prize”—in this sea of adjectives, since “prize” might seem a more likely synonym of  “wealth” than of Indra. However, in the rhetorical universe of the R̥gveda it would  certainly be possible to refer to a god as a prize. We think it highly likely that the  poet intended the audience to consider both possibilities throughout the sequence.  
The last three verses (6–8) more conventionally state that praises are being  offered, to Br̥haspati (vs. 6) and to Indra (vss. 7–8), in return for favors.
