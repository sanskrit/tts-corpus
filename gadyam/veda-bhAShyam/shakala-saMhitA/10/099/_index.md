Indra  
Vamra Vaikhānasa  
12 verses: triṣṭubh  
In this very obscure hymn the exact contents and referents in each verse are almost  impossible to interpret and identify, and much of the translation is therefore provi sional. On the other hand, the structure and progression of the hymn are surprisingly  clear. Although it is an Indra hymn, at least according to the Anukramaṇī, the name  Indra does not appear until the very last verse, the poet’s summary verse (12b), and  then only once. In fact the hymn contains almost no divine names: Rudras (in the  plural, perhaps of the Maruts, perhaps not, in vs. 5) and Varuṇa in a simile in verse  10. The first four verses contain no names at all, and though subsequent verses do  contain a number of them, most of these are names of enemies or of mortals aided  by the gods. As in many other difficult hymns the avoidance of names seems to be  meant to keep the referents deliberately unclear, and the contorted phraseology and  allusions to otherwise unknown stories, especially in the earlier parts of the hymn,  seem designed to keep the audience guessing and in some cases to deliberately mis  
lead them. As the hymn goes on, Indra’s identity becomes clearer, as in verse 9 with  the Śuṣṇa/Kutsa saga. (On this obscure verse see also Jamison 2009d [2013].) The grammar mirrors this gradual progress toward the recognition and perhaps the  epiphany of Indra. The hymn begins in verse 1 with questions about the identity of  the referents, an indication of maximal uncertainty. The next seven and a half verses  (2–9ab) display an advance toward certainty: almost every half-verse begins with the  pronoun sá “he,” suggesting that the poet has a definite referent in mind, however  vague it may be to the audience. But sá is a discourse pronoun: it does not indicate  where the referent is located. Starting with the second half of verse 9 the next four  half-verses begin with a form of the deictic pronoun ayám “this one here,” strongly  pointing to a referent in the immediate vicinity of the speaker. These ayám forms may  signal the actual presence, the epiphany, of Indra, arrived at the sacrificial ground.
