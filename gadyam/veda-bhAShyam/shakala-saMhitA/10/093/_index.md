93 (919)  
All Gods  
Tānva Pārtha  
15 verses:  prastārapaṅkti, except anuṣṭubh 2–3, 13, paṅkti? 9, nyaṅkusāriṇī 11,  purastādbr̥hatī 15 [per Anukramaṇī]  
Even more so than the previous hymn, X.92, this hymn to the All Gods poses more  challenges to the interpreter than it yields rewards. This opinion seems to be almost  universally shared (see, e.g., Geldner, Renou, Gonda [1975: 212]), and it is generally  agreed that some of the problems may be due to faulty transmission.  
The poem is composed in a variety of meters, with verses of mixed twelve/ eleven- and eight-syllable pādas, at least in principle—though often these pādas  do not conform, by syllable count, caesura, or cadence quantities, to their models.  (On the meter see Oldenberg 1888: 101, 117.) The syntax of the hymn is also quite  sketchy, with many verbs missing and with nominal forms often apparently merely  juxtaposed rather than being linked by normal case relations, and the identity of  the referents in many verses is obscure.  
The reasons for the choice of the gods honored and their sequence are also not  clear. The hymn begins with a verse to Heaven and Earth, who recur in verse 10.  Verses 2–3 treat the gods in general, while verse 4 begins to name names, starting  with the Ādityas. The next three verses (5–7) form a relatively well-organized unit,  with a focus on the Aśvins and a shared opening (utá naḥ “and us”). The end of  verse 7 provides a transition to verse 8, with the R̥bhus and their master, Indra, who  also appears in verses 9 and 11. The poet summarizes his poem in verse 12 (with  more pride than we would perhaps allow him). Verses 13–15 constitute a dānastuti,  mentioning a number of patrons. Note that the name that the Anukramaṇī supplies  for the poet has simply been extracted from the name(s) of one or more patrons in  verse 15.
