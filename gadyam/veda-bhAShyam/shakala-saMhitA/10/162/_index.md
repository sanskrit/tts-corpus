Against Miscarriage  
Rakṣohan Brāhma  
6 verses: anuṣṭubh  
This charm is meant to deflect the dangers of miscarriage or harm to the embryo  in any stage, including immediately after birth. The stages of pregnancy are nicely1644 X.163  
laid out in verse 3, a good example of the indirect means by which we can gain  information about Vedic people’s knowledge and conceptualization of “real life.”  The methods by which the “ill-named affliction” might gain access to the fetus are  graphically depicted in verses 4–6.
