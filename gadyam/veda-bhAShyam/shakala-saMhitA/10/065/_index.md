All Gods  
Vasukarṇa Vāsukra  
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15  
The poetic pedigree sketched above gives us high expectations for the hymn, which,  however, begins unpromisingly with a simple enumeration of gods. Nonetheless,  although the style never achieves the same distinction as that of the poet’s putative  relatives, there are many nice touches and twists and turns of syntax, particularly in  verses 2–8, treating the cosmogonic deeds of the gods and the praise and sacrifice  offered to them by mortals.  
The hymn seems to begin anew with verse 9, which contains another straightfor ward listing of gods, continued in verse 10. A brief account of cosmogony (vs. 11) is followed by a sketch of the Aśvins’ deeds (vs. 12). Minor gods join the undifferentiated  mass of All Gods in verses 13–14, and the hymn ends with Vasiṣṭha’s summary verse.
