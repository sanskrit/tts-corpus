Indra  
Aṣṭrādaṃṣṭra Vairūpa  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
On the one hand, this hymn simply recites, in straightforward but artful fashion,  some of Indra’s most celebrated deeds: the Vala myth and the freeing of the cows/ dawns (vss. 3–4, possibly 2), the Vr̥tra myth and the freeing of the waters (vss. 6,  8–10), with several others glancingly referred to: the propping of heaven and fixation  of the earth (vss. 4–5), the smashing of Śuṣṇa (vs. 5). As often, the Vala and Vr̥tra  myths are sometimes superimposed upon each other, with the cows/dawns of the  former conflated with the waters (also female) of the latter. For example, the first  pāda of verse 8 seems to continue the travels of the Dawns found in verse 7, but the  next pāda makes it clear that the referent is actually the waters of the Vr̥tra myth.  
On the other hand, and especially in its first few verses, the hymn concerns itself  with the interaction between poems and deeds. In verse 1 we poets rouse Indra by  making his deeds real, that is, by celebrating them in poetry. In verse 2 the poetry  almost seems to precede and stimulate the deed, and verse 3 provides us a picture  of Indra whose knowledge of his own deeds seems to derive from hearing about  them from poets. If our understanding of verse 4 is correct, the power of poetry to  provoke the deeds it celebrates is put into the mythic past, with the Aṅgirases bring  
ing Indra’s feats to realization by their hymns. Although this theme disappears in  the rest of the hymn, to a poetically acute audience its resonances would probably  still be felt in the more conventional treatment of Indra’s deeds that follows.
