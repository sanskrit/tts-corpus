Gambler  
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa or Akṣa Maujavant  
14 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 7  
One of the most famous, most translated, and most anthologized hymns in the  R̥gveda, this lively and vivid lament of the gambler depicts the sad lot of a man  addicted to dicing but unsuccessful at it. This hapless speaker describes the intoxi cation that grips him when he is playing or even contemplating play and that leaves  him helpless to resist (vss. 1, 5–9), as well as the toll this compulsion takes on his  personal life and the self-pity this evokes in him (vss. 2–4, 10–11). At the end of the  hymn the gambler vows to renounce play (vs. 12), and the god Savitar restores him  to his former position (vs. 13). The final verse (14) is the gambler’s address to the  dice, urging them to leave him alone and find another victim. This portion of the  

hymn has the form of a ritual expiation, embodied especially in the last words of  12d, in which the gambler avows the truth of his speech.  
Dicing was an important cultural feature of ancient India, especially associ ated with kings and the ruling class. Already in middle Vedic sacrifice, in the  Rājasūya, the ritual of the consecration of the king, there is a ritual dicing  match, rigged so that the king-to-be wins. Of course, the whole of the great epic,  the Mahābhārata, is determined by the outcome of the dicing match between  Yudhiṣṭhira and his cousins: Yudhiṣṭhira gambles away his kingdom, his broth ers, his wife, and himself and must fight to regain his kingship. The much-loved  story of Nala and Damayantī also involves the gambling away of a kingdom,  this time by Nala. And the dharma texts consider gambling, along with hunting  and womanizing, to be a characteristic pursuit—and vice—of kings (cf. Mānava  Dharma Śāstra VII.47, 50; for condemnation of gambling in general see, e.g.,  MDŚ IX.220–28).  
Ancient Indian dicing was quite different from the game that the word con jures up in the modern mind, and much scholarship has been devoted to figur ing out what the play actually consisted of (see, e.g., Lüders 1907; Falk 1986).  It seems to have involved a large quantity of a particular kind of nut (vibhīdaka /vibhītaka) as the dice; these had no markings on them. They were thrown into  a hollow on the ground, and the players took turns pulling out a handful. The  best “hand” was one divisible by four, and the other hands were ranked accord ing to how many nuts were left over after a division by four, with a single leftover  nut being the worst (see vs. 2c). For details, see Falk (1986: 73–133). Although  it may be hard for us to imagine the passions enflamed by this kind of long  division, our own games of chance probably will not stand up to scrutiny some  millennia in the future.  
The monologue form found here is almost unprecedented in the R̥gveda, and  the shifting play of emotions—guilty excitement, tender remembrance of his  past life and family, scorn for his own weakness and the disgust he arouses in  others, bitter anger at the inanimate dice that brought him low, to which he  ascribes agency and malign intention and for which he still longs—is psychologi  
cally convincing and very moving. Showing our own biases, we might proudly  deem it quite “modern.”
