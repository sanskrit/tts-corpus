Indra  
Brhaduktha V ̥ āmadevya  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
This short hymn begins by announcing (somewhat cryptically) that Indra’s fame or  reputation is what prompted a frantic call on him from Heaven and Earth (vs. 1cd), and it ends (6cd) with the poet’s summation of his own praise hymn. In between  there is both standard praise of Indra’s well-known deeds (e.g., vss. 1cd, 3)  and  more ambiguously phrased assessment of his accomplishments. In verse 2bc, for  example, Indra’s victories seem almost dismissively characterized as a magic trick  (māyā́, the word later famously used of the “illusion” of reality) produced by his  own boasts. The four names of Indra in verse 4 are presumably his famous epi  
thets, such as vr̥trahán “Vr̥tra-smasher,” but the poet also seems to be slyly implying  that Indra’s deeds are reducible to words. These deprecatory hints are slight and  could be otherwise interpreted, but in any case the poet has avoided a conventional  recital of Indra’s exploits. Instead he seems to be saying that Indra’s great deeds  and the words that express them are essentially the same: his reputation is equiva  
lent to himself (vs. 1ab); his own proclamation of his powers is taken by the world  as identical to “battles” (vs. 2); his epithets are the power that produces his deeds  (vs. 4). Although this poetic ploy is, in one sense, the usual message that mortals’  praises strengthen Indra for his deeds, the poet here seems to be claiming something  more: that the poet’s formulations are Indra’s essence.  
In the very last pāda of the hymn the poet seems to be doing something simi lar with his own name Br̥haduktha (“having/producing lofty speech”), as Jesse  Lundquist has suggested to me (personal communication). The pāda (6d) reads  brahmakŕ̥to br̥hádukthād avāci (“...has been spoken...from Br̥haduktha, the crafter  of sacred formulations”), with his name positioned between the other two words in  the line. The first half of his name, br̥hát, is a close phonological match to the first  half of the first word, brahma “sacred formulation”; the last half of his name, uktha “(solemn) speech,” is etymologically related to the verb avāci. Thus his very name  can be, as it were, transformed into the verbal products that are his reason for being.
