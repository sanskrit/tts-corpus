Visvakarman ́  
Viśvakarman Bhauvana  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
Viśvakarman, the “Maker of Everything” (or literally, “who has the making of  everything”), is the carpenter (vs. 4ab) and smith (vs. 3cd) of creation, who fash ioned the world. But he is also both an ancient seer (ŕ̥ṣi) and Hotar (vs. 1) and a  present companion (vs. 5cd) and help (vs. 7) to the sacrificers, for his priestly work  has continued from the ancient past into the present (vs. 1cd). This priestly work  is closely connected with his creative work. He wins heaven and earth by a sacri fice that he carries out for his own sake (vs. 6ab), and his ritual work is dedicated  to the benefit of the realms he surveys (vs. 5). In the first line the poet speaks of  Viśvakarman’s “pouring” beings “in oblation” (júhvat). It is not clear exactly what  he means by that phrase, but it likely describes a process by which Viśvakarman  sustains the living world through time or continues to make living beings his own.1514 X.81  
The phrase must be significant, since the poet verbally recalls it in the last verse,  when he anticipates that Viśvakarman will enjoy the “oblations” (hávanāni) offered  to him. In 1c the description “seeking wealth with hope” refers to Viśvakarman’s  ritual activity, which carries the hope of prosperity for the sacrificer.  
The first and last verses of the hymn create a frame for the hymn. In the first  verse, Viśvakarman is both a seer (ŕ̥ṣi) of hymns and a Hotar, who pours oblations  (júhvat). In the last he is the vācás páti- “Lord of Speech,” who “will take pleasure in  oblations (hávanāni).” That is, within the hymn, Viśvakarman begins as the model  of a priest who both speaks and makes offerings, and concludes as the master of  speech and the recipient of offerings, who supports the sacrificers. This movement  from divine priest to priestly divinity exalts poets and priests, who are closely asso ciated with him and whose words and deeds follow his.  
One of the stylistic characteristics of the hymn is the echoing of Viśvakarman’s  name through the frequent use of víśva “every, all” (vss. 2d, 3ab, 7cd). Even more  striking is the repeated use of words containing the v-sound also extracted from  his name. Over a third of the words of the hymn contain that sound. Its repeti  
tion is especially obvious in 5cd śíkṣā sákhibhyo havíṣi svadhāvaḥ svayáṃ yajasva  tanvàṃ vr̥dhānáḥ and 6ab víśvakarman havíṣā vāvr̥dhānáḥ svayáṃ yajasva pr̥thivī́m  utá dyā́m, two pādas that together have a string of twelve words containing v. The  invocation to Viśvakarman and his presence thus persist even when his name is not  explicitly mentioned.
