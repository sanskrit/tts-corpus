‘कुह ' इति पञ्चदशर्चं षष्ठं सूक्तमैन्द्रम् । पञ्चदशी त्रिष्टुप् पञ्चमीसप्तमीनवम्यस्तिस्रोऽनुष्टुभः शिष्टाः पुरस्ताद्बृहत्यः । आद्यद्वादशकर्त्र्यष्टकवती पुरस्ताद्बृहती। पूर्ववदृषिः । तथा चानुक्रान्तं-- ’कुह पञ्चोना पुरस्ताद्बार्हतं त्रिष्टुबन्तं त्वं त्या चिदा नस्त्वं नोऽनुष्टुभः' इति । चतुर्थेऽहनि निष्केवल्य एतत्सूक्तम् । सूत्रितं च--- कुह श्रुत इन्द्रो युध्मस्य त इति निष्केवल्यम्' (आश्व. श्रौ. ७, ११ ) इति ॥

Indra  
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra  
15 verses: purastādbr̥hatī, except anuṣṭubh 5, 7, 9, triṣṭubh 15  
The metrical scheme of this hymn is unique in the R̥gveda (see Oldenberg 1888: 122);  most of the verses have an 11 8 8 8 configuration (or something approaching it),  despite the Anukramaṇī’s identifications. Like many hymns whose meter is irregu lar, this one is driven more by phraseology, verbal echoes, and lexical chaining than  by meter. The responsion and chaining begin with the first two verses, which consist  
of a rhetorical question about Indra’s fame (vs. 1) and its answer (vs. 2). The general praises of Indra continue in the next two verses, but shade, in  verse 4, into the myth (or fragments of myth) that occupy most of the rest of the  hymn: the journey of Indra and his client Kutsa (unnamed here) to the house of  Uśanā (Kāvya) with the horses of the Wind (vss. 4–6), the plea to Indra to smite the  demon Śuṣṇa (7–9), and the actual slaying of Śuṣṇa and its aftermath (vss. 10–11,  14), with several verses interspersed (12–13) begging Indra for aid and comfort.  (These may belong to the Śuṣṇa saga and represent the speech of the same “we”  who asked Indra to kill the demon in vss. 7–9, but they can also be generalized to  the current “we” of singers and patrons.)  
Although there are many puzzles in these mythological verses, the real crux is the  pair concerning (apparently) the slaying of Śuṣṇa, verses 10–11, which contain sev eral well-nigh-impenetrable hapaxes and whose syntax is in places unparsable. Verse  10, especially, may be deemed impossible, and its translation is therefore provisional  and differs radically from others’ interpretations. We believe that it contains a badly  remembered and garbled allusion to an inherited Indo-Iranian mythic complex.  The hapax kārpāṇé, which others interpret as “in the sword-combat” (relating it  to a much later attested word kr̥pāṇa “sword”), we connect with the Avestan word  karapan (read disyllabically in the Gāthās), the designation of a person or persons  hostile to the Mazdayasnian religion and associated with equally hostile kauuis  

(e.g., Yasna 44.20, Yasna 32.12, 14–15, Yasna 46.11)—just as our kārpāṇé occurs  in a verse with unidentified (and, as it happens, syntactically untethered) kavis. In  the topsy-turvy religious system of the Gāthās, of course, entities viewed positively  in the R̥gveda (like kavis) have negative valuation. This is not the place to explore  this hypothesis in detail, but for another apparent manifestation of this myth, see  X.99.9, and for further discussion see Jamison (2009d [2013]).  
The hymn ends with an impeccable triṣṭubh verse (15), containing a conven tional invitation to Indra to drink the soma and conventional wishes for his good  will and patronage.
