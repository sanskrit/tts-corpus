Indra  
Reṇu Vaiśvāmitra  
18 verses: triṣṭubh  
The poet’s patronymic links him to the Viśvāmitra clan of the IIIrd Maṇḍala, and  indeed the final verse (18) is the Viśvāmitra refrain, found in many of the Indra  hymns of III (III.30.22, etc.). The penultimate verse (17d) mentions the Viśvāmitras,  though that half-verse seems to have been borrowed from the Bharadvājas (VI.25.9).  The poet appears to take his legacy quite seriously, for the hymn strikes one as  self-consciously old-fashioned, a well-crafted Indo-Iranian praise poem, celebrat  
ing Indra’s high cosmogonic deeds in carefully balanced rhetoric and beginning  classically with the 1st-person subjunctive announcement “I shall praise Indra”  (índraṃ stavā). The poet has also inherited the verbal cleverness appropriate to a  proper r̥ṣi: his similes and figures of speech are aptly deployed, and he knows how  to mislead his audience and withhold information for surprise effect. This particu  
lar skill is clearest in verse 5, which appears to continue the praise of Indra, until  we encounter as the first word of the second hemistich sómaḥ, the real subject of  the verse.  
In the second part of the hymn, beginning in verse 8, we encounter another  theme dear to the Indo-Iranians: the punishment to be meted out to those who  break or play false to their alliances or have no alliances at all. The word mitrá “alli ance, ally, deified Alliance,” alone or in compounds, appears seven times in verses  8–15, and is, of course, an element of the poet’s ancestral name. Indra is repeatedly  urged to punish the transgressors on behalf of the gods whose task is to maintain  the proper relationships among men, namely Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman (see  vss. 8–9). It is striking that, unlike in many Indra hymns, we don’t simply call for  Indra’s aid in battle against whatever enemies oppose us; in this hymn our enemies  are characterized as moral failures.  
There is another way in which the poet appears to show his consciousness of  his tradition—one that we might hesitantly call “intertextuality.” In verse 14 the  poet seems to be consciously citing, with some variation, the famous Indra-Vr̥tra  hymn I.32. He asks that after Indra’s exercise of vengeance the enemies “will lie”  in a certain way: pr̥thivyā́ āpŕ̥g amuyā́ śáyante “will lie there . . . in the (same) way  (as) the embracer of the earth.” It is difficult not to see this as a deliberate con  
flation of two famous phrases describing Vr̥tra from I.32: 5d . . .śayata upapŕ̥k  pr̥thivyā́ḥ “will lie as the embracer of the earth” and 8a . . . amuyā́ śáyānam “lying  in that way.” This quotation and conflation of phrases from a particular, and no  

doubt well-known, poem seem quite different from the standard formulaic varia tion of our traditional poets, and it is perhaps not surprising to encounter it in  the Xth Maṇḍala, as the practice of traditional poetic composition was drawing  to a close.
