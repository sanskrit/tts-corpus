‘इनो राजन्' इति सप्तर्चं तृतीयं सूक्तम् । ऋष्याद्याः पूर्ववत् । ‘इनः' इत्यनुक्रान्तम् । प्रातरनुवाकाश्विनशस्त्रयोरुक्तो विनियोगः ॥

Agni  
Trita Āptya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The very moment of transition from night to dawn is the event celebrated in this  hymn—the time when the ritual fire is kindled. Agni’s triumph over Night, a female,  and his welcoming of Dawn, likewise a female, are the subjects of the first three  verses, and the whole hymn is pervaded by Agni’s wide shining and the many words  that express his radiance and brightness.  
The poet is also fond of synesthetic images, as when his journeys “kindle” calls  in verse 4, or his beams “purify themselves” (the signature verb of the soma drinks)  like sounds (probably of soma as well) in verse 5. The poet’s pet word for Agni, aratí “spoked wheel” (vss. 1, 2, 6, and 7), presumably originally referring to the shape of  the fireplace, prompts a number of chariot and journey images through the hymn  (vss. 4, 6, 7).
