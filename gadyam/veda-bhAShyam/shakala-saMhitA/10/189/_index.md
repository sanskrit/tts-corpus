‘ आयं गौः' इति तृचमष्टात्रिंशं सूक्तं गायत्रम् । सार्पराज्ञी नामर्षिका । सैव देवता सूर्यो वेति । तथा चानुक्रान्तम्- आयं गौः सार्पराज्ञ्यात्मदैवतं सौर्यं वा ' इति । अविवाक्येऽहनि मानसग्रह एतत्सूक्तं शंसनीयम् । सूत्रितं च- आयं गौः पृश्निरक्रमीदित्युपांशु तिस्रः पराचीः शस्त्वा' (आश्व. श्रौ. ८. १३ ) इति ॥

Sārparājñı or Su ̄ ̄rya  
Sārparājñī  
3 verses: gāyatrī  
The Anukramaṇī assigns this hymn either to Sūrya or to the shadowy figure  Sārparājñī ([female] descendant of the Queen of the Snakes), who is also said to  be its author. The former identification seems far more likely, or, rather, the hymn  appears to be set at the dawn sacrifice and to play with the various sources of light  
1660 X.190–191  
that compete and combine at that time: the sun and the ritual fire, as well as Dawn  (vs. 2ab). The fire, and in part its counterpart the sun, is portrayed as a variety of  animals: a (male) cow (vs. 1), a buffalo (vs. 2), and a bird. The association of speech  with the bird is also found in the Pataṃga hymn (X.177) and probably reflects the  importance of ritual speech at the dawn sacrifice. There are no signs of snakes,  much less their queen.
