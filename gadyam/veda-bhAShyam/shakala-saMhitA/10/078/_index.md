Maruts  
Syūmaraśmi Bhārgava  
8 verses: triṣṭubh and jagatī  
This hymn has the same unusual meter as X.77 and, like X.77, is structured as a  series of similes. In fact, this hymn goes further than the previous hymn in both  features. The only standard triṣṭubh verse is the final one (8), which also breaks the  rhetorical pattern. And the similes not only continue throughout the hymn (until vs.  8) but are under more rigid syntactic control. It is worth discussing in some detail  how the poet has crafted his hymn and how the apparently rigid repetitive structure,  with each pāda containing exactly one simile, still allows the possibility of forward  momentum and rhetorical climax. (See also Jamison 2007: 77–79.)  
Each of the first seven verses of this eight-verse hymn contains four pāda-length  similes, each marked with ná “like,” and with the point of comparison almost  always positioned at pāda-end. Since in runs of similes it is common to alternate  between the simile-markers ná and iva, the complete avoidance of iva in this hymn  is noteworthy and the regular repetition of ná contributes to the sense of regimenta  
tion. Furthermore, the ná is almost exclusively in second position in the pāda and  is generally the last syllable of the opening (before an often irregular break: see the  introduction to X.77).  
All of these similes are in the nominative plural masculine, with the Maruts  always the subject. This rigid syntactic structure, reinforced by its coinciding  exactly with metrical units, has an almost claustrophobic effect—an effect signifi cantly enhanced by the fact that the first six verses are entirely nominal in their  syntax:  in these twenty-four separate clausal similes there is not one finite verb  or even predicated participle. (This exclusively nominal style cannot be entirely  captured in translation.) This syntactic stasis contrasts markedly with the nature  of the subjects being celebrated, for the Maruts are the most active gods in the  R̥gveda. Moreover, many of the similes in this hymn concern the Maruts’ uncon  
trollable energy, despite the motionless quality of the poetic form. The disjunc tion between content and form produces a remarkable aesthetic effect. Yet the  effect is not of complete stasis even in these verses, for the subjects of the similes  modulate from verse to verse, while the complexity of imagery increases gradu ally. For examples, the winds appear in verses 2 and 3 in different images, likewise  bride-seeking young men in verses 4 and 5, with two types of stones and two types  of mothers in verse 6.  
And then finally in verse 7 the straitjacket of nominal style is broken: though this  verse, too, contains four pāda-length similes, both hemistichs end with finite verbs,  7b vy àśvitan “they have shone forth,” 7d mamire “they have measured.” While  maintaining the underlying structure that unifies the hymn, the poet manages, by  strictly grammatical means, to build to a climax. The energy kept suppressed by the  nominal style is finally released by the finite verbs of verse 7.  

The last verse (8), which is, as noted, the only standard triṣṭubh, abandons the  structure of the rest of the hymn, and in conventional terms asks the gods for the  usual gifts, as so often in final verses. But it is noteworthy for containing the first  and only occurrence of the name marút in the hymn. Retroactively we can see that  the hymn also functions as a very long riddle, whose answer is given only in this last  verse. This verse is linked to what precedes by a small and subtle verbal device. As  noted, twenty-five of the twenty-eight preceding pādas begin X ná, with the simile  marker in second position; verse 8 begins X no (i.e., naḥ “us”). The poet invites us  to expect yet another simile, but substitutes the phonetically similar 1st-person plu ral enclitic pronoun in its place. Thus, though the verse is cast in entirely different  stylistic terms from the rest of the hymn, its integral connection to what precedes is  signaled by the playful naḥ. (Note that the naḥ is entirely unnecessary in this verse,  since it redundantly doubles and anticipates the full pronoun asmā́n opening the  second pāda.)
