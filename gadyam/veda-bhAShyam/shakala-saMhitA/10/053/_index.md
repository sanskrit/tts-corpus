Agni [“Opferlied”]  
Agni Saucīka  
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 6–7, 9–11  
This hymn begins from the situation depicted in the last two hymns, but turns into a  mystical meditation on the sacrifice. The first three verses are apparently spoken by  mortal sacrificers, who have installed the recovered Agni as Hotar and are pleased  (vs. 3) with the resulting success of their sacrifice.  
In verses 4–5 Agni responds, inviting both gods and men to take pleasure in his  application to this ritual role. Verse 4 also contains one of the few R̥gvedic refer ences to the enmity between the gods (Devas) and the Asuras. Although this persis tent rivalry dominates middle Vedic mythology, it only begins, very tentatively, to  appear in the late R̥gveda, to which period this hymn belongs.  
The next three verses (6–8) are again the speech of human priests, addressed  both to Agni and to fellow celebrants, urging them to carry on the ritual work. In  verse 7 the sacrifice, as often, is metaphorically identified with a chariot, and the  puzzling beginning of verse 8 may refer metaphorically to a river crossing, taking  the sacrificers to a better state.  
The most enigmatic verses of the hymn are the last three (9–11), in jagatī meter  (as opposed to the prevalent, but not ubiquitous triṣṭubh). They begin with the god  Tvaṣṭar, the “Fashioner” of the gods: he has fashioned drinking cups for the gods,  and now sharpens a hatchet for Brahmaṇaspati to use. Since Brahmaṇaspati has  a transparent name, “Lord of the Sacred Formulation,” he is almost surely going  to use the hatchet to hew a sacred formulation, the mystical verbal embodiment  of cosmic truth. In verse 10 the poets are urged to use the same types of tools,  presumably to fashion the same things: sacred formulations. Or, in another com mon metaphor, to create “hidden tracks” (that is, mystical verbal compositions).  Verse 11 may be an example of such a hidden track: it is certainly impenetrable  enough, with riddling and paradoxical images that several millennia of study have  not solved.
