Agni  
Havirdhāna Āṅgi  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
On first reading, this hymn appears to be full of non-sequiturs and false starts, but  further consideration allows some coherence to be wrung from it. It begins inno cently enough, with two verses devoted to the sacrifice initiated by Agni as Hotar,  with Heaven and Earth as witnesses—picking up the topic of the last verse of the  preceding hymn (X.11.9). In our view, the third verse continues that theme: an obla tion derived from a cow, probably ghee, is made into the fire; thus it is Agni’s “own  acquisition.” This sacrificial event in some sense generates the gods and their cos mic activity, which is framed as a yájus or sacrificial formula, and it also generates  the rain, the “heavenly ghee.” We may see here an early example of the famous  Upaniṣadic doctrine of the Five Fires and the water-cycle, whereby the oblations,  produced from the plants and animals on the earth, rise to heaven as smoke and  return to earth as water, to start the cycle anew. The sacrifice begun in verse 1 seems  to end with verse 4, where Heaven and Earth are again (as in vs. 1) called upon to  hear us. What has been added conceptually is the notion that Heaven and Earth  also participate in the cycle that the sacrifice controls, by producing rain (“honey”)  in the course of time.  
The second half of the hymn (vss. 5–8; vs. 9 is repeated from the preceding hymn,  X.11.9) appears to be on another subject, or several other subjects, entirely. It begins  with the worried speaker speculating on what wrong we have done to Varuṇa, con trasting the unfathomable reactions of that god with the more forthright and reliable  Mitra. It ends (vs. 8cd) with the perhaps over-hopeful assertion that Mitra, along  

with Aditi and Savitar, will declare us blameless to Varuṇa. But the verses in between  (6–7) at first seem unconnected with this current drama. It is our contention, how ever, that these verses, especially verse 6 about Yama, provide the mythological sup  
port for the poet’s hope that his relationship with Varuṇa can be repaired. Verse 6 needs to be read in the context of X.10, the famous dialogue between  Yama and his twin sister Yamī, but also of X.13.4, another cryptic verse about  Yama in this cycle of hymns. In X.10, as is well known, Yama and Yamī argue  about her desire to have sex with him in order to produce offspring. He strongly  resists, condemning (X.10.2) their possible pairing by characterizing it with the  phrase also quoted in 6b of this hymn: sálakṣmā yád víṣurūpā bhávāti, “that (the  female) will have the same ‘marks’ [=family characteristics] (though) dissimilar  form [=gender]” in our rendering. This phrase has received many different inter pretations; we believe that it defines the forbidden incestuous partner Yamī as  being of the same family but of a different shape—female rather than male—as  Yama. The dialogue of X.10 ends with the issue unresolved. It is X.13.4 that  seems to give us the answer. In that verse Yama “chose death” for the sake of the  gods and for the sake of offspring “did not choose immortality.” It seems that  Yama was born immortal (see esp. I.83.5) but chose to forego this state, in order  to produce children and also to institute the sacrifice to the gods. This act of  self-abnegation and the change of state it produced is, in our view, what is being  celebrated in verse 6 here. The poet first (pāda a) mentions Yama’s “immortal  (name),” which he does not want to think about—since it reminds him of the  taint of incest (pāda b), but his other name, by implication the “mortal” one, is  a happy one to think about and ensures Agni’s protection for the thinker. (Note  that the actual name Yama is only mentioned in the second instance.) In the next verse (7) we move to the seat of Vivasvant, a common kenning for the  ritual ground, but in this context it is important to remember that Yama is a descen dant of Vivasvant (see his patronymic in, e.g., nearby X.14.1 vaivasvatám...yamám).  The juxtaposition of Yama in verse 6 and Vivasvant in verse 7 reminds the audience  that Yama chose death in order to institute the sacrifice, and further reminds them  that when they perform sacrifice they are replicating the actions of Yama, which  transformed his bad reputation (“name difficult to contemplate”) into a good one.  Thus, though we still have no idea why the gods do what they do (see 7ab, 8ab), we  trust in the power of our sacrifice to make things right with these inscrutable gods.
