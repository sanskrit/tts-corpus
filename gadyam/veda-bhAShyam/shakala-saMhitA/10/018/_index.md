Death, etc.  
Saṃkusuka Yāmāyana  
14 verses: triṣṭubh, except 11 prastārapaṅkti, 13 jagatī, 14 anuṣṭubh  
This lovely hymn falls into several sections, each treating the end of the funeral  service. The first six verses depict the mourners leaving the service and returning to  their lives. Death is dismissed in verse 1, and in verses 2–3 the living turn back to an  enhanced life, full of “dancing and laughter” (vs. 3). They are separated from death  by a barrier (vs. 4); in the later ritual a stone is set down near the grave. Verses 5–6  are especially concerned with the orderly sequence of life and death, in particular  the fear that the younger will die before their elders and disrupt the proper sequence  (see esp. 5cd).  
The next three verses (7–9) have been much discussed, especially in the context  of “suttee” (satī) or widow-burning, though the verses are emphatically not a depic tion thereof. From verse 8 it appears that the widow lies down, temporarily, beside  her dead husband, but is summoned back to life and indeed symbolically reborn  to become the wife of a new husband (quite possibly her brother-in-law, in levirate  marriage). The happy women in verse 7 apparently approach the funeral pyre to  adorn the widow for her return to life. A similar “return to life” is granted the dead  man’s bow in verse 9, where someone, quite possibly the dead man’s son, repossesses  the bow to put it to future use.  

The burial is the subject of verses 10–13, with an emphasis on the softness and  gentleness of the welcoming earth, both mother and bride, which lies lightly on  the dead man. Verse 13 forms a sort of ring with verse 1, with both expressing a  prohibition against harm with the same construction and the same root √riṣ (1d  mā́...rīriṣaḥ, 13b mā́...riṣam). This ring defines the final verse (14) as outside the  hymn proper, and other indications support this extra-hymnic status. It is in dimeter  meter, instead of the trimeter that prevails elsewhere, and the Aśvalāyana Gr̥hya  Sūtra, which treats the ritual usage of all the other verses, ignores it, as does the  medieval commentator Sāyaṇa. The sense of this verse is also much disputed. Many  scholars think that the poet is predicting his own future death, on a day that is  approaching him, in the first hemistich, and in the second he restrains his speech in  anticipation. (As Geldner says, rather more dramatically than usual, “der Rest ist  Schweigen” [the rest is silence].) In contrast, we consider this to belong to the typi cal genre of hymn-final meta-poetic verses, in which the poet comments on his own  skill in producing the poem that precedes. By this interpretation, the first half-verse  concerns the well-conducted funeral that has just taken place, while the second  refers specifically to the poet’s taming and controlling the speech that accompanied  that ritual.
