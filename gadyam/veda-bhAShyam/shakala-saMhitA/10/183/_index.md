‘ अपश्यम्' इति तृचं द्वात्रिंशं सूक्तं त्रैष्टुभम् । प्रजापतिपुत्रः प्रजावान्नामर्षिः । ऋचः क्रमेण यजमानपत्नीहोतॄणामाशिषः प्रतिपादिकाः । अतस्तद्देवताकाः । तथा चानुक्रान्तम् - अपश्यं प्रजावान् प्राजापत्योऽन्वृचं यजमानपत्नीहोत्राशिषः' इति । प्रवर्ग्येऽभिष्टव एतत्सूक्तम् । सूत्र्यते हि -- अपश्यं त्वेत्येतस्याद्यया यजमानमीक्षते द्वितीयया पत्नीं तृतीययात्मानम् ' (आश्व. श्रौ. ४, ६) इति ॥

183 (1009)  
For the Birth of a Son [To the Sacrificer (1), the  Sacrificer’s Wife (2), and the Hotar (3)]  
Prajāvat Prājāpatya  
3 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first two verses present a fragment of dialogue, with patterned repetition,  between a wife and a husband, preparatory to attempting to conceive a son. As  Geldner points out, the situation seems to be similar to that depicted in I.179 (the  Agastya–Lopāmudrā dialogue), with the husband ending a period of asceticism  (see vs. 1b) and the wife eager for sex and its product, children. It thus conforms to  the pattern common throughout Indian literature of the reluctant ascetic and the  sexually aggressive female (see Jamison 1996a: 15–17 and passim), but in the short  exchange here the husband seems more amenable than usual, and the rhetorical  responsions between the two verses make the pair seem more attuned to each other.  The final verse (3) is spoken by an unidentified spirit responsible for all sorts of  fertility, who promises sons.
