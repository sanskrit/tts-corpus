Agni  
Damana Yāmāyana  
24 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 11–14  
The focus on the cremation fire in the last part of the preceding hymn (X.15) is  enlarged upon here. This fire is seen both as a blessed release of the dead man to the realm of the ancestors and as a menace to the vulnerable dead body. This  ambivalence is clearly on display in the first verse, where the fire is begged not  to burn up the body, but, on the other hand, to make the dead man “cooked”  and ready to go to the forefathers. The same sentiment is repeated in verse 2,  and the journey undertaken. The dead body itself is addressed in verse 3, with  its parts consigned to the corresponding cosmic entities. Two more verses to  Agni follow (4–5), continuing the themes of verses 1–2. In verses 6–7 the body  is addressed again: in verse 6 it is reassured that the physical indignities it has  undergone since death will be fixed by the cremation fire and by soma, but in  verse 7 it is urged to protect itself against the same fire. The cremation seems to  end with verse 8.  
With the cremation concluded, the next verses (9–12) treat the inauspicious but  powerful cremation fire and the means to render it harmless and to reintegrate it  into the generally auspicious sphere of fire. The “flesh-eating fire” is first explicitly  distinguished from “the other” fire, the ritual fire that receives the oblations to the  gods, and the flesh-eating fire is assigned the task of taking the sacrifice to the  ancestors and bringing them to the sacrifice here. Since this task is parallel to that  of the other fire, the gods’ ritual mediator, the negative aspects of the flesh-eating  fire can be set aside, and it can be conceptually reconfigured as a positive force, a  transformation completed in verse 12.  
In the final two verses (13–14) the place where the cremation took place returns  to nature, with the fire extinguished and plants growing again. The import of the  final apostrophe to a cool and chilly feminine entity is clear, even though the refer ent (a water plant?) is not.
