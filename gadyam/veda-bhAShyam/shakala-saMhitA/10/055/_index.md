Indra [or the All Gods?]  
Brhaduktha V ̥ āmadevya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
A puzzling and enigmatic hymn, with close ties to the previous hymn, especially  at the beginning. The first puzzle is that this, the second of the three Br̥haduktha  hymns (X.54–56), is assigned Indra as its deity in the Anukramaṇī, but is longer  (eight verses) than the previous hymn (X.54, six verses), which is also dedicated to  Indra. Bergaigne (per Oldenberg 1888: 226) suggests that the ascription is incor  
rect, and that this is really an All God hymn, as is the next one (X.56, seven verses).  Although Oldenberg rejected this suggestion (1888: 238–39) on grounds of content,  we are inclined to accept it. Although Indra is the clear or likely deity of most of  the verses (1–3, 7–8), the center part of the hymn (vss. 4–6) is not, in our view,  Indraic. Moreover, the numerology (see esp. vss. 2–3, 5) and the riddling phraseol  
ogy throughout, without expressed referents, are quite reminiscent of a certain type  of speculative All God hymn.  
The first verse of the hymn exactly matches that of X.54 in structure (with X.55.1  somewhat clearer syntactically), and their second pādas are almost identical. Both  concern the call that Heaven and Earth issued to Indra in fright, and go on, in the  second hemistich, to recount other of Indra’s deeds. And this verse also takes up the  theme of the “hidden name” found also in X.54.4. But already in X.55.1 we meet an  unidentified referent: “the sons of your (or a?) brother,” especially puzzling because,  as far as we know, Indra has no brother.  
The name theme continues in verse 2, but introduces a light, into which five  unidentified dear ones merge. Nothing further is made of this merger, but the same  lexeme “merge into” (sáṃ √viś) is used in the next hymn (X.55.1) for the merger of  the body of the dead with light in some unspecified distant place, and it seems likely  that our passage touches on the same theme of death and transfiguration. Though  verse 3 begins with a conventional deed of Indra, filling the world-halves, it pursues  both the numerology of verse 2 and the light, now both fragmented and unified.  Although various identifications of the referents here have been proposed, none is  entirely convincing; moreover, the poet seems more interested in keeping us guess ing than in providing a clear roadmap.  
What does seem clear is that the cosmic context of Heaven and Earth and the focus  on light(s) have led us to astronomical imagery, which occupies the next three verses  of the hymn. We begin (vs. 4) with Dawn, explicitly identified, and celebrated in a for mulaic final pāda that is modeled on the refrain of a famous mystical All God hymn, III.55, where the “one and only lordship” is that of the gods. The next verse (5) has  no identified referents at all, and the language is difficult and cryptic. Nonetheless it  seems to refer to the moon traveling among the stars, until swallowed up by a gray  one—perhaps the gray twilight of dawn or the smoke of the ritual fire kindled at  dawn. The poet seems to recognize the hyper-“poetic” quality of this description (5c)  and provides a simply phrased (though not simply interpreted) gloss in pāda d. Verse  6 is most easily interpretable as referring to the sun, who is called a “ruddy eagle”  elsewhere in the R̥gveda, but it could also be Agni or Indra; if the latter, it provides a  transition to the final two verses (7–8), which belong more clearly to Indra.
