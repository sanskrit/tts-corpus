Mūrdhanvant Āṅgirasa or Vāmadevya  
19 verses: triṣṭubh  
Two simultaneous superimpositions structure this hymn. On the one hand, the  present-day sacrifice involving the establishment of the ritual fire and the pouring  of oblations into it is contrasted with the primal production of the sacrificial fire  by the gods. The present-day sacrifice begins (vs. 1ab) and ends (vs. 19) the hymn,  and periodically surfaces throughout (vss. 3, 5, 14). However, the dominant strain  is the primordial one, which begins in the second half of verse 1; the role of the  gods in creating the original sacrifice and “begetting” the sacrificial fire is especially  emphasized in verses 4 and the long sequence of 7–13, where the phrase “the gods  begot” appears four times (vss. 8–10, 13), alongside similar expressions. This the matic strain is especially striking because the gods are also regularly identified as  “worthy of the sacrifice” (vss. 3, 6, 11, 13; see also 5, where Agni is so called), that  is, worthy of receiving the sacrifice, while they are in fact performing the sacrifice.  
The other theme of superimposition is the identification of Agni, especially  under the epithet Vaiśvānara “belonging to all men,” with the sun. At first the sun’s  dependence on and complementarity with Agni is mentioned (vss. 1b, 2, 6):  the  sun only becomes visible and begins to shine when Agni is also visible. But the  cosmos-filling radiance and heat of Agni (see vss. 3, 5, 7, 9) leads gradually to the  premise that the gods created Agni as the sun, expressed clearly in verses 10–13.  The poet then acknowledges Agni as the sun (vs. 14) and in enigmatic language  describes the two paths between heaven and earth along which the sun / cosmic fire  moves (vss. 15–16).  
The last three verses (17–19) seem to provide a simultaneous transition  from the cosmic and primordial elements in the superimposed structures to the  present-day everyday—by way of a dialogue between two unnamed participants.  Most interpreters (e.g., Geldner and Renou) identify the speakers as two priests,  probably the Brahman and Hotar who are explicitly mentioned in the last pāda of  the last verse (19d). But the words that introduce the speakers in verse 17, ávara and pára, are ambiguous. They can mean “nearer” and “farther” (referring to the  positions of the priests on the sacrificial ground), but they can also mean “lower”  and “upper” / “below” and “above,” as derivatives of these words do in verse 14.  In verse 17 they can therefore refer to cosmic elements. It is our view that in verse 17 the dialogue is first presented as a debate between Earth and Heaven (which  appear at the end of vs. 15 as the defining poles of the cosmos) about their roles  in sacrifice, but the dialogue participants unobtrusively become transformed into  present-day priests.  
The final verse anchors us firmly in the here-and-now of the sacrifice, but also  asserts that as long as the morning fire will be kindled and the dawns will dawn, the  sacrifice as we know it will be performed. This assertion may involve a bit of propa ganda. The term brāhmaṇá as the technical designation of a priest appears in this  verse; this term was only introduced in the late R̥gveda (as opposed to the earlier  brahmán “formulator”), presumably as part of a codification and partial reorgani zation of the sacrificial system. The poet may then be claiming a long future for the  new system, and implicitly suggesting its long history, stretching back to the origins  of the world—cloaking a religious innovation in a garment of imagined tradition,  as so often.
