Saramā and the Paṇis  
Saramā and Paṇis  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
In the interpretation of this well-known and delightful dialogue hymn we follow the  compelling study by Hanns-Peter Schmidt in his Br̥haspati und Indra (1968: 185– 89). This dialogue takes place in the midst of a narrative whose outlines are clear,  even if its details are not. The Paṇis have entrapped cattle in a cave. Indra and the  ancient Vedic seers wish to release the cattle. Therefore, Indra sends his dog Saramā to track down the Paṇis and to demand the release of the cattle. She crosses the  Rasā, the river at the border of the world that separates heaven and earth, and finds  the Paṇis. The Paṇis refuse to surrender the cattle, however, and at the end Indra  and the seers—the Aṅgirases and Navagvas—themselves come to the place where  the Paṇis have hidden the cattle. They break open the cave through the power of  the hymns they compose and chant. Because Indra’s weapon in this story is not the  vajra, the mace with which he destroys Vr̥tra, but the truth embodied in the hymns  that Indra and the seers recite, Indra is here called Br̥haspati, “Lord of the Sacred  Formulation.”  
The story also tells of the coming of the dawns, since the power of Indra’s and  the seer’s words lies in the secret truth that the cattle are the dawns. Note that at the end, the poet uses the power of this truth for his own ends: through the truth of his  hymn, he should acquire or recover cattle.  
Despite the seriousness of the theme, it is hard to believe that the audience did  not relish the depiction of a talking dog, especially one as saucy and forthright as  the faithful Saramā, who resists the offered blandishments of the Paṇis, to remain  loyal to her master Indra.
