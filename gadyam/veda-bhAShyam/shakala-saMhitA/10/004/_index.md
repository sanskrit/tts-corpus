Agni  
Trita Āptya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The usual high points of the birth and growth of Agni are covered in this hymn.  What gives the hymn its character are the concentrated and somewhat unusual  images that are studded through it. This is already evident in verse 1, where Agni  (who is fire, after all) is compared to “the first drink in a wasteland”; presumably  the point of comparison is that both are eagerly desired and it is not certain they  will appear. A  series of similes involving domestic animals follow in verses 2–3,  while verses 4–6 concern the firewood that covers the nascent fire and that it begins  to consume. The most elaborate and surprising image is found in verse 6, where the  two arms of the priest who is tending the fire are compared to two thieves entering  the woods, risking their lives. “Going into the woods” must refer to the manipula tion of the firewood; the “risk” must be that of being burned. But why “thieves”?  Most commentators think that the thieves are entering the wood to attack travel  
ers and tie them up with cords—the ten cords compared to the priest’s ten fingers.  Perhaps, but the image is the more resonant for not being entirely transparent.
