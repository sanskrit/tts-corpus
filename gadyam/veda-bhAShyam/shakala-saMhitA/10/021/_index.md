Agni  
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra  
8 verses: āstārapaṅkti  
This hymn is notable for two related formal features, its meter and its refrain. The  meter āstārapaṅkti (8 8 / 8 4 8 4) is limited to this group of hymns attributed to  Vimada, providing the meter for the two hymns X.21 and X.25 and the first half  (vss. 1–3) of X.24. (The Anukramaṇī identifies the meter of the single verse X.170.41404 X.21  
as āstārapaṅkti, but the characteristic 8 4 8 4 sequence must be read as 12 12 there.)  In all the Vimada occurrences the two four-syllable pādas form a grammatically  unified refrain (the same refrain in all three hymns), interrupted by an eight-syllable  pāda semantically and syntactically integrated into the rest of the verse: ví vo máde  
x x x x x x x x vívakṣase “In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).” The  first four-syllable pāda of the refrain is also a pun on the poet’s name: ví vo máde,  literally “in exhilaration you...,” but also “Vi...mada” (itself interrupted by the  enclitic pronoun vaḥ). Although the effect is striking and insistent, it is also impos  
sible to render in translation, and so the refrain has been unified and placed at the  end of the verse. To illustrate the difficulties of a literal translation, we will give a  rendering of the first verse in this hymn in that style:  
As if with (hymns) with their own twists, we choose you, Agni, as Hotar for our sacrifice whose ritual grass has been strewn—in exhilaration you  (gods)—  
(we choose you,) sharp and pure-flamed—I wish to acclaim.  
The formal novelty of the hymn is not matched by its content, which is simply a  typical celebration of Agni’s installation as Hotar at his kindling, along with wishes  for his gifts of wealth.
