‘आ वः' इत्यष्टर्चमष्टमं सूक्तम् । इरावतः पुत्रस्य सर्पजातेर्जरत्कर्णनाम्न आर्षं जागतम् । सोमाभिषवार्था ये ग्रावाणस्तद्देवत्यम् । तथा चानुक्रान्तम्-‘आ वोऽष्टौ सर्प ऐरावतो जरत्कर्णो ग्राव्णोऽस्तोत्' इति । ग्रावस्तोत्र एतत्सूक्तम् । सूत्रितं च-’आ व ऋञ्जसे प्र वो ग्रावाण इति सूक्तयोरन्तरोपरिष्टात्पुरस्ताद्वा' (आश्व. श्रौ. ५. १२) इति ॥

Pressing Stones  
The snake Jaratkarṇa Airāvata  
8 verses: jagatī  
Of the three hymns dedicated to the pressing stones (X.76, X.94, and X.175), X.175  is brief and minimalist. Hymns X.94 and X.76 have a number of phrases and images  in common, but X.94 is more charming than X.76, with vivid and imaginative com parisons and a light tone, while X.76 is perhaps more rhetorically ambitious, with  some mythological and cosmic resonances, as well as some challenging syntax. The  stones are more often addressed in the 2nd person and with imperatives in X.76 (no  imperatives are addressed to the stones in X.94). This implicit attribution of agency  to the stones becomes more pronounced toward the end of this hymn, where they  seem to supplant the human pressers. The word náraḥ “superior men” is found in  verses 6–8; although the first two occurrences could be interpreted as referring to  humans, the last is a vocative addressed to the stones—which makes it clear that in  the previous two verses the “men” must be the stones as well.
