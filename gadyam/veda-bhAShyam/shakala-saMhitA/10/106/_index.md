Aśvins  
Bhūtāṃśa Kāśyapa  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
There is no question that this is the most frustrating hymn in the R̥gveda. Structured  like another Aśvin hymn, II.39, it presents a blizzard of similes—generally one each  pāda, four to a verse—with the two gods compared to all manner of animals, people,  body parts, and cosmic features. Unfortunately the style goes far beyond the recon  
dite to the utterly incomprehensible, with impossible hapaxes of unusual morpho logical structure, seemingly in part driven by phonological play. These words may  be archaic or dialectal or slang or belong to specific technical fields or borrowed/ adapted from a substrate language or playfully generated from morphological tem plates—or, as has been suggested, the middle section may be written in a kind of  
code, with phoneme-by-phoneme substitution. Or all of the above, and more. In any case, following the eminently sensible lead of Geldner (implicitly endorsed  by Oldenberg and Renou), we have simply left the middle verses (5–8) untranslated,  while attempting to wring sense from the outer frame. Although many ingenious  attempts have been made to interpret the baffling lexical items in this hymn and  more could have been made, such attempts remain just that—exercises in ingenuity.  It seems more honest, as well as truer to the spirit of the hymn, evidently designed  to challenge the decoding skills of the most proficient and experienced hearers, to  acknowledge its impenetrable center. From this several observations emerge. First,  this appears to be the ultimate omphalos hymn. In most omphalos hymns the center  holds the mystery, but the mystery is expressed in words whose purport can be puz zled out. Here that mysterious center deliberately defies analysis by being expressed  in words that are tantalizingly close to familiar word-types, but whose code cannot  be cracked—and rendered all the more frustrating by the presence of real, analyz able words in the midst of the semi-gibberish. The hymn takes the notion of an  omphalos and carries it as far as it can go, suggesting that many mysteries will  remain beyond our apprehension, or at least our apprehension by verbal means. The outer verses (1–4, 9–11) reveal further traces of poetic structure, espe cially when compared with II.39 mentioned above. The parallels between the two  hymns seem to be deliberate and self-consciously generated. They begin almost  identically:  the first pāda of II.39.1 (minus the opening simile) reads. . .tád íd  árthaṃ jarethe “you two awaken to just this aim,” in sense and verbal expression  almost identical to our ubhā́ u nūnáṃ tád íd arthayethe “Now you both have just  this as your aim,” with the “awaken” postponed until pāda c. The final verses of  both hymns (II.39.8, X.106.11) are summary verses, announcing the hymn just  completed (interestingly called a mantra in this hymn) and urging the Aśvins to  drive to the hymn and the sacrifice. In between are a varying number of verses,  constructed as webs of similes, most of which are more complex and clever than  the general run of R̥gvedic similes. It thus seems that this hymn-type provides a  

template, which could generate within it an unlimited number of inventive com parisons. It is not hard to imagine this process as a competitive one, with poets  vying to use the most outré words and over-strained and mannered images, all  contained and controlled by the overall structure of the template. In our hymn we  return to discipline from the unruly center via several verses of reasonably com prehensible similes (vss. 9–10) to reach, with some relief, the safe shore of verse  11. (It may not be entirely fanciful to suggest that the first simile in the return  verses [9a] promises “firm standing in the depths”—something the audience has  surely been seeking, in vain.)
