Vāyu  
Ula Vātāyana  
3 verses: gāyatrī  
As with X.168, although the Anukramaṇī identifies the divinity of this hymn as  Vāyu, he is only called Vāta “Wind” here. He is credited with the ability to provide  healing (vs. 1) and, in all three verses, to keep us alive and prolong our lifetimes.  This strong association between life and the wind must be mediated through the  latter’s identification (bandhu) with breath, although this identification is not made  explicit in the hymn.
