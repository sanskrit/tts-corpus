Creation of the Sacrifice  
Yajña Prājāpatya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1  
In its first three verses the hymn depicts the creation of the acts of the sacrifice  through the image of weaving. The form of the sacrifice was instituted by the gods  (vss. 1, 3)  and first carried out by the “fathers,” the ancient seers who were the  ancestors of the current priests (vs. 6). Indeed, these fathers are at the present rite  as well (1cd). In verse 2 it becomes complicated because it is difficult to know who  the actors are. In 2ab the subject may not be “a man,” but “the Man,” a figure  similar to the Puruṣa of X.90. That is how Sāyaṇa and others have understood it.  But it might also refer simply to “a man” in the sense of “a human” and imply that  humans have taken up the weaving of the gods and ancestors, and in doing so their  activity reaches to heaven. Again in 2cd it is not clear who “they” are who have sat  down to weave the sacrifice. They might be the fathers after 1cd, the human priests  in continuation of 2ab, or the gods in anticipation of verse 3. Since any of these  could have been so described, the ambiguity may be intentional.  
Verse 3ab completes the weaving image, although the terminology reflects the  ritual as much as it does weaving. The “model” and “image” could be for a woven  cloth or a ritual performance. The nidā́na, a “connection” or a “rope,” might fit  weaving but does not fit the ritual very well. Since according to X.114.2 poets are  

able to see the hidden “connection,” in a ritual context it may describe knowledge  that a priest has. On the other hand “melted butter” and a “frame” could find a  place in either weaving or ritual. In 3cd the imagery is all from the sacrifice. In 3c  the poet mentions the Praügaśastra, which is the second recitation of the Morning  Pressing in the classical Agniṣṭoma. The recitation comprises I.2–3, which names  the deities who receive soma in the three pressings in an Agniṣṭoma, and may have  been singled out because of that. The last line could also be translated “when all  the gods sacrificed to the god,” but we have understood it as an echo of 6d and  X.90.16a (=I.164.50a) yajñéna yajñám ayajanta devā́ḥ “with the sacrifice the gods  offered the sacrifice.”  
The ritual frame described in verses 1–3 is then filled with gods in verses 4–5,  verses that link the various meters of Vedic poetry with the major gods of the sacri ficial day. There are various associations between a particular meter and a particu lar god: The sacrificial fire, Agni, begins the sacrificial day, and the gāyatrī meter is  associated with the morning soma-pressing. The name of the br̥hatī-meter is similar  to the name of Br̥haspati, and Indra hymns are characteristically composed in the  triṣṭubh meter. And, balancing Agni and the gāyatrī, the All Gods and the jagatī meter are associated with the evening soma-pressing.  
The last two verses recall the ancient sages who ordered the sacrifice and affirm  that the priests today follow the path that has been set for them. As Geldner notes,  the “courses (of the ritual)” refer to the actions of the ritual to which the recitations  are attached.
