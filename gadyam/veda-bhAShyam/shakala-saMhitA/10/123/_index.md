Vena  
Vena Bhārgava  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
A famous and mystical hymn, whose opacity still defies complete comprehension  although its main features are clear. The subject is announced in the first words of  the first verse: “this Seeker” (ayám vénaḥ), and the Anukramaṇī also attributes the  hymn to the same figure, or his multiform: Vena Bhārgava. This poet is also cred  
ited with the soma hymn IX.85 by the Anukramaṇī, and the last four verses of that  hymn (9–12), which contain phraseology quite similar to X.123 and which we might  term “Vena without Tears,” help clarify X.123. What is at issue is the common iden tification of Soma and the Sun, united in the Seeker figure, who is also identified as  a Gandharva (vss. 4 and 7) and as a bird (vss. 5–6). Most verses are applicable to  either Soma or the Sun, and, as is common in hymns with such dual referents, the  effort of fashioning phraseology that works for both referents accounts for many  of the enigmas in the hymn, beginning with the birth and first appearance of the  Seeker in verses 1–2.  
It is noteworthy that the Seeker is also eagerly sought: the inspired poets pursue  him (vss. 1, 4, probably 6), as do women seeking a husband (vs. 2) and mothers (vs.  

3)—both feminine references probably standing for the hymns produced by these  poets. Needless to say, both Soma and the Sun are regularly the object of such  poetic attentions, and the intimate bond between poets and what they celebrate is a  prominent theme in the hymn.  
Less prominent, but perhaps not less important, is the theme of name-and-form.  This first surfaces explicitly in verse 4, where it is their recognition of the form of  the Seeker that inspires the poets’ longing for him. In the same verse the Seeker, as  Gandharva, finds “the immortal names.” Later, in verse 7, this same Gandharva  engenders his own names. These verses seem to adumbrate the later preoccupation  with name and form as representing the creation of the multiplicity of objects in the  world by the division of the formless into “forms” and the assignment of “names” to  each in order to differentiate them. This theme is treated with great skill and subtlety  also in III.38. In this hymn here the Gandharva’s engendering his own names in the  penultimate verse of the hymn leads to a climax of sorts in the final verse (8), though  one that is quite downplayed. In that final verse the undifferentiated figure of Soma/ Sun is actually divided into its two constituent parts, though neither is mentioned by  name. The first half of the verse concerns the drop (drapsá), a word regularly used of  Soma, while the second half has as its subject bhānú “radiance,” which is especially  characteristic of the Sun. Through the power of the poets’ perception of the true  “form” of things and their ability to assign them “names,” Sun and Soma emerge at  the end of the hymn as separate, though mutually dependent, entities.
