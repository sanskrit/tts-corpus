All Gods  
Nābhānediṣṭha Mānava  
27 verses: triṣṭubh  
The near impenetrability of this hymn with all its poetic tricks and semantic eva sions produces a certain despair in the translator, and it is no wonder that even  sensible and thoughtful interpreters have clearly gone astray—as, no doubt, have  the present ones. Much of what follows is tentative and provisional, but we have  attempted to give an interpretation that is internally consistent and depends as little  as possible on outside and post-R̥gvedic materials.  
This hymn and the next one are attributed by the Anukramaṇī to Nābhānediṣṭha  Mānava. Although the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa contains a story about Nābhānediṣṭha  (AiB V.14), it is generally agreed that this later tale has little to do with this hymn  and cannot explain its mysteries. We would go further and suggest that the sup  
posed poet’s name has simply been extracted from verse 18, where it is, in our view,  the name or epithet of a different participant. We are inclined to ascribe the hymn  rather to Kakṣīvant, the crafty poet of I.116–126, or a descendant or would-be  epigone of his: Kakṣīvant is mentioned in verse 16, and the hymn has certain con  
nections with Kakṣīvant’s oeuvre, especially I.121.  
The hymn consists of several different sections, but we believe that these are all  linked through the dawn sacrifice and the participants therein, particularly Dawn  herself, Agni, the Aśvins, and Indra. Two mythological sections treat different  myths about Dawn, and these are sandwiched between sections apparently depict  
ing and meditating upon an early-morning sacrifice and the dakṣiṇās, or priestly  gifts, distributed there.  
The first four verses concern a man called Tūrvayāṇa, who in a verbal contest  produces a supremely effective verbal formulation, which brings the Aśvins to the  sacrifice and which also prompts liberal gifts to himself and which rescues or oth erwise provides help to his parents and priests. His effective speech is contrasted  with that of Cyavāna (a client of the Aśvins in other circumstances), who produces1474 X.61  
only “sweet dregs” (vs. 2), while Tūrvayāṇa’s speech is likened to gushing semen. His  invocation to the Aśvins is given verbatim in verse 4.  
The next four verses treat the shocking story of Heaven’s incest with his daughter,  Dawn. This is a favorite myth of the middle Vedic period (see Jamison 1991: 294– 96), but nowhere is it as graphically, if fragmentarily, treated as it is here. She finally  escapes (vs. 8), but before this happens, some of his semen is spilled on the ground  (vs. 7), indeed on the ritual ground (vs. 6). From this semen the ritual fire is fash ioned (vss. 7 and 9). Thus, though the rape of Heaven’s daughter is depicted as  brutal, it results in the creation of the central ritual substance—as so often, around  the world, in myths of cosmic rape and incest the taboo sexual encounter is primally  creative. It seems likely that the comparison of Tūrvayāṇa’s verbal production with  semen, in conjunction with the overall theme of dawn sacrifice, prompted the telling  of this story in just this place.  
Verse 9 and the birth of fire form the transition to the next mythological sec tion, the freeing of Dawn from the Vala cave by the Aṅgirases and Navagvas (vss.  9–13). Verses 9–11 all begin “right away” (makṣū́). As noted, verse 9 treats the newly  created fire. In verse 10 (at least in our reading of it) the Navagvas attempt to free  Dawn from her “protector,” the Vala cave. In verse 11 the mythic motifs of the  Dawn cow and her milk and of Agni, the product of Heaven’s semen, are brought  together—the motifs that are sacrificially found together in the dawn sacrifice. The  Aṅgiras story is continued in the two following verses (12–13), though the dramatic  high point has already been reached.  
The subject changes abruptly with the next verses (14–15), back to the ritual  fire and the sacrifice to which the Aśvins will come. There then follows a section  that has led many commentators (see especially Oldenberg and Geldner) to con struct elaborate family trees and “back-stories” for the poet, who is supposed to  be seeking either a new, adoptive father (Geldner) or a new varṇa (Oldenberg). In  our view these ingenious constructions are unnecessary and misguided. Instead  the poet, perhaps Kakṣīvant (16c), is presenting his patron with what appears  at first to be a praśasti, an encomium, but which then gently mocks him for  his pretentions and for perceived stinginess. Verse 16 is a fine straightforward  piece of praise, attributing grand titles and qualities to the king, in our view the  poet’s patron. Verse 17 is more equivocal. The king, the sacrificer, is “of two lin  
eages”: this is the term that provoked the family-tree constructions of Oldenberg  and Geldner. We think rather that the poet is suggesting that the king is kin to  both the human and divine races—or that the king so believes (see the next verse).  But the poet also says that the king ought to milk the cow that yields sap but  does not give birth—which may be an allusion to the king’s slowness to produce  dakṣiṇās for his poet, who points out in the second half of the verse that he him  
self is doing his job in producing poetry. Verse 18 seems to us to embody the  pretensions of the patron-king. His name or epithet is Nābhānediṣṭha, “nearest to  the navel”: “navel” is a standard metaphor for origin and close kinship (especially  the point of origin of two disparate groups), as well as for the focal point of the sacrifice or indeed the world itself. (This epithet must be very old, as the same  word is found in Younger Avestan nabānazdišta “closely related, next of kin.”)  And in the second half of the verse he wonders aloud how high his “navel” is,  relative to an unidentified other, then boasts of the unbroken chain of generations  that links him to the original navel. He gets his comeuppance in the next verse  (19), where the god Agni lays claim to the real navel, the gods, the two births, and  the cow and her products.  
With the patron put in his place, the hymn now turns to a depiction of the  dawn sacrifice, or rather its conclusion, in five verses (20–24), each beginning with  the word ádha “(and) now.” The dakṣiṇās are now properly given (see 21ab), and  the poet therefore calls on the gods for honor and protection for the patrons (vss.  22–23). In the final verse of this sequence (24) the poet and his colleagues appear  to be poised to express their final prayers (24b), prayers found in the final verse  (27). In between are two verses (25–26) that ascribe “good lineage” to an unidenti  
fied subject, who both takes pleasure in a praise hymn and performs ritual service.  The “good lineage” reminds us of the patron’s claims to distinguished kinship  earlier in the hymn, which were trumped by the god Agni. In these two verses we  believe that the poet deliberately left the subject unidentified and that he meant  the verses to be read with both Agni and himself (the poet) as potential subjects,  thus associating himself with the fine family and divine relations that the patron  craved.  
Needless to say, this is a very speculative reading of the poem, and many details  remain unaccounted for. It is to be hoped that further progress can be made in its  interpretation, within a R̥gvedic context.
