Dialogue of Yama and Yamı̄  
Yama Vaivasvata and Yamī Vaivasvatī  
14 verses: triṣṭubh  
This justly famous (and much discussed) hymn presents a tense dialogue between  a pair of twins, the male Yama and female Yamī (yamá means “twin”; yamī́ is the  feminine form), who become the first mortals. Yamī́, who speaks first, urges her  twin brother to have sex with her, so that they can have children and continue their  line in the approved manner. Yama indignantly rejects her advances, outraged by  the idea of incest and certain that the divine guardians of moral order will see the  act and punish them.  
It is impossible in a short introduction to do justice to the richness of this hymn  and the extraordinary skill with which the poet deploys grammatical categories  such as person, number, and verb modality in service of the condensed drama of  their encounter. Both Yamī and Yama make legalistic arguments, often using juridi  
cal turns of phrase, and especially in the first part of the hymn they distance the  personal and emotional implications of their speech by regularly using plural and  3rd-person forms to refer to each other. It is not until the last word of verse 4 that  one of them uses a 1st-person dual (“we two”) form. They also use dueling divine  models for the relationships they are arguing for: Yama cites their near ancestors,  “the Gandharva in the waters and the watery maiden,” as reason not to violate  the incest taboo (vs. 4) and Mitra and Varuṇa as stern enforcers (vs. 6) with spies  everywhere (vs. 8)—while Yamī claims that Tvaṣṭar, who shapes embryos in the  womb, made them a married couple already in the womb (vs. 5) and twice (vss. 5,  9) invokes as their divine counterparts Heaven and Earth, a notoriously incestuous  pair (as she makes quite explicit in 9c). The use and placement of kinship terms  

in the hymn is also notable, including the fact that “brother” and “sister” are not  encountered until verse 11. It is also striking that the names of the speakers do not  appear until verse 7.  
The emotional temperature of the hymn rises significantly at that very point.  Yamī abandons her legalistic arguments—that they need to have offspring, that they  were already a married couple in the womb—in favor of a naked expression of sexual  desire. Yama remains unmoved, but the roiling emotions are reflected in the ragged  meter of some of the later verses (12–13), especially in the latter verse where Yamī breaks off her speech in frustration in a very short pāda containing two occurrences  of a word (batá) found nowhere else and exhibiting aberrant phonology. Our render  
ing of the word aims at the level of slangy insult to which batá appears to belong. The hymn ends in an impasse. Yama remains obdurate and urges Yamī to find  another lover—a difficult quest when there are no other mortals! However, given  the rest of his history, sketched briefly above, we must assume that he gave in in the  end, on the evidence of X.13.4.
