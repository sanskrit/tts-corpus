Against Nightmare  
Pracetas Āṅgirasa  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh 1, 2, 4, triṣṭubh 3, paṅkti 5  
The Anukramaṇī labels this hymn duḥsvapnaghnam, literally “destroying bad  dreams,” while Geldner titles it “Absolution from Sins” and Renou simply  “Expiation.” None of these characterizations quite captures the varied semantic  field of this brief hymn. It begins with the curt dismissal of an otherwise unknown  “Lord of Thought” (or “Lord of Mind”), ordering him to go far away and speak  to the goddess Dissolution (Nirr̥ti), who presides over chaos and calamity. The  Lord of Thought is to provide her with some examples of men’s thoughts, in verse  2. These examples seem to be the sort of harmless self-delusions whereby people  reassure themselves that all is going well for them. But in verses 3 and 4 the verbal  behavior becomes less innocent—culminating in one of the worst offenses in Vedic  India (and indeed Indo-Iranian), deceit (vs. 4). We ask various gods, including  Indra “Lord of the Sacred Formulation” (voc. brahmaṇas pate), presumably Indra  in his role as Br̥haspati, to distance these offenses from us. The final verse celebrates  the success of this request and expresses our desire that all such offenses be visited  on our enemy.  
The unifying theme of the hymn is thus all sorts of mental and verbal action,  whether harmless or hostile, whether done consciously (awake) or not (asleep), or  even both (the “waking dream” of vs. 5).
