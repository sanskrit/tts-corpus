‘ अयमग्ने' इत्यष्टर्चं चतुर्दशं सूक्तमाग्नेयम् । शार्ङ्ग इति पक्षिविशेषस्याख्या। शार्ङ्गजातयो जरितृप्रभृतयश्चत्वारश्चतुर्णां द्वृचानां क्रमेण द्रष्टारः । आदितो द्वे जगत्यौ । अथ चतस्रस्त्रिष्टुभः। ततो द्वे अनुष्टुभौ । तथा चानुक्रान्तम्- अयमष्टौ द्वृचाः शार्ङ्गा जरिता द्रोणः सारिसृक्तः स्तम्बमित्रश्चाग्नेयमाद्ये जगत्यौ चतस्रश्च त्रिष्टुभः' इति । गतो विनियोगः ॥

Agni  
The four Śārṅgas: Jaritar 1–2, Droṇa 3–4, Sārisrkva 5–6, Stambamitra 7–8 ̥ 8 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1–2, anuṣṭubh 7–8  
Though short, this hymn displays both a well-articulated structure and intricate pat terns of repetition and phonological echoes. The first six verses, in trimeter meter,  have an outer ring (vss. 1, 6) and an inner, thematically contrasting core. Verse 1  praises the protective, ritual fire, and verse 6 returns to this prize-giving fire and  the divine attendance upon it. In between, verses 2–5 describe fire as an ever-more dangerous substance. Though in verse 2 the danger is confined and contrasted with  the poets’ successful productions, the following verses give free rein to the destruc  
tive power of wildfire with vivid descriptions of its progress through the land. The final two verses, in a different meter, append a magical charm, to banish  dangerous fire from the land and make that land the abode of water and plants. The Anukramaṇī identifies “the four Śārṅgas” as the poets of the hymn. This is  an allusion to an episode in the Mahābhārata (Śārṅgopākhyānam, MBh I.220–25),  

in which four birds, sons of an ascetic, are spared by Agni during the otherwise  complete burning of the Khāṇḍava Forest. This tale almost certainly postdates the  composition of our hymn.
