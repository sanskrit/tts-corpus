Dawn  
Saṃvarta Āṅgirasa  
4 verses: dvipadā virāj  
Although the Anukramaṇī identifies the divinity of this hymn as Dawn, only the  last verse (4) clearly belongs to her, and, at least in verse 2, the masculine adjectives  preclude Dawn as subject. Commentators have suggested other deities: Dawn (vs.  1), Sūrya (vs. 2), Agni (vs. 3), Dawn (vs. 4), or Sūrya (vss. 1–3). These particular  identifications cannot be confirmed, but it is clear that this is a hymn appropriate to  early morning. In verse 2 the subject awakens mortals. Though verse 1 is less clear,  the cows there are on the move after giving milk (in our interpretation):  as real  cows, they are going to pasture after the morning milking; as dawn cows they are  following the track of the sun out of the east and across the sky, having filled the  sky with their milky light. In the third verse the sacrifice is begun, as is appropriate  at dawn. And finally in verse 4 Dawn makes an explicit appearance upon her birth.
