Bharadvāja 1, Kaśyapa 2, Gotama 3, Atri 4, Viśvāmitra 5, Jamadagni 6, Vasiṣṭha 7 7 verses: anuṣṭubh  
The Anukramaṇī attributes these seven verses to seven different authors, and it is a  distinguished group of poets indeed: the same foundational r̥ṣis in the same order as  in IX.67, a hymn that seems intended to bring together the separate poetic lineages  into a unified pan-Ārya assemblage for political purposes.  
It is difficult to discern such a grand design in this hymn, which, moreover, shows  no signs of composite nature. Six of the seven verses (all but vs. 6) are found together in  single hymns in both the Śaunaka and the Paippalāda recensions of the Atharvaveda  (IV.13 and V.18 respectively), and the contents form a unity. Not surprisingly, given  its Atharvaveda parallels, it is a simple Atharvan healing spell, calling on the gods, the  wind, and the waters to bring a remedy for the disease afflicting the object of the spell.  The poet-officiant is the actual effector of the healing, however, and in the last verse  of the hymn (7; see also vs. 4) he deploys both his hands and his voice to bring about  the cure—the usual pairing of action and speech characteristic of Atharvan practice.
