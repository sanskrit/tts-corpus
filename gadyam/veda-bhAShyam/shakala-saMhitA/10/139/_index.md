139 (965)  
Sūrya (1–3), Visvá ̄vasu (4–6)  
Viśvāsu Devagandharva  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is a companion piece to the previous one (X.138), though the Anukramaṇī ascribes them to different poets and assigns different deities to them. The evidence for their connection includes shared vocabulary and close lexical variants—e.g.,  mádhye ...diváḥ 138.3 and divó mádhye 139.2  “in the middle of heaven”; pradhí (“wheel segment”) 138.6 and paridhí (“encirclement”) 139.4; ahī́ “fertile cow”  138.1, 139.6; daṃsáya / dáṃsas 138.1, 2 “wondrous skill” and dákṣa 139.6 “skill,  capability”—as well as ring composition:  138 begins with two verses about the  opening of the Vala cave and the release of the fertile cows, and the final verse of  139 (vs. 6) returns to exactly this theme.  
More subtle is their shared thematic concern. As noted in the introduction to  138, that hymn seems to treat disturbances to the orderly progress of cosmic time  and the heavenly bodies that measure it, the sun, the moon, and dawn. By contrast  X.139 focuses on the sun, in part through its (partial) representations: Savitar (vss.  1, 3) and the heavenly Gandharva (see also I.123, the Vena hymn, where Vena and  the Gandharva represent an amalgam of the sun and Soma). The hymn also depicts  the sun as holding its proper place and performing its proper functions. Though in  this hymn (vs. 2) as in the last one (vs. 3) the sun stands still in the middle of heaven,  in 138 this stoppage seemed ominous, whereas in this hymn the sun’s position seems  designed to give him the best view of the whole phenomenal world. It is repeatedly  emphasized (vss. 1d, 2a, c, 3b) that he (or his representatives) sees everything, and  as heavenly Gandharva he measures the airy realm (5b), again displaying proper  cosmic progress.  
It must be admitted, however, that many things remain unclear in this hymn,  particularly verse 4.
