The Gods  
Brhaspati ̥ Āṅgirasa, Brhaspati Laukya, or Aditi D ̥ ākṣāyaṇī  
9 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Geldner remarks that the hymn almost seems as if the poet intentionally wanted to  show the insolubility of the problem of the origin of things by setting incompat ible theories of cosmogony alongside one another. While we find greater coherence  than this, we recognize the complexities and uncertainties that caused Geldner to  come to this conclusion. At least at a very general level, the hymn does show a cos mogonic progression from “what is not existing” to “what is existing” and finally to  immortal gods and mortal humans.  
The hymn also has thematic elements in common with the preceding hymn. The  most obvious is that bráhmaṇas pátiḥ, the Lord of the Sacred Formulation (vs. 2),  is Br̥haspati, who is invoked at the beginning of X.71. Then too, while it has the  appearance of a cosmogony, the hymn also makes repeated reference to sacrificial  performance. One thematic strand of this hymn is that the sacrifice embodies the  principles that gave rise to the world.  
In verse 3 what Br̥haspati “smelted” is the “births” of the gods, as Sāyaṇa already  noted. Br̥haspati brings them about by means of a sacred formulation (bráhman) expressing the origins of the gods. But such a formulation can also bring about the  birth of the gods in a specific ritual place at the time of a ritual performance. In that  way, words—or the thoughts behind words—can make beings real. Perhaps this is  what the poet means when in verse 2d he says that “what exists,” what are “things”  (the world, the gods, and humans), was born from “what does not exist,” what are  not “things” (thoughts or words).  
In verse 3cd “the one whose feet were opened up” gives rise to what exists, which  in turn gives rise to the regions of space. But in 4ab “the one whose feet were opened  up” gives rise to the earth, which gives rise to the regions. That is to say, between  the two hemistichs, there is a shift in the middle term: “what exists” in verse 3 and  “the earth” in verse 4.  The key to the significance of this shift is the word bhū́  
“the earth.” “The earth” is only one possible translation; the word could also mean  a “form” that something assumes (cf. III.55.13b=X.27.14d) or, etymologically at  least, the act of “becoming.” If the ambiguity is intentional, then the two verses  together redefine “what exists” as that which has material substance—most broadly  the earth or more specifically what has form.  
The source of “what exists” or “the earth” is the principle or entity described as  “one whose feet were opened up” (uttānápad). Falk (1994: 7–10) understands uttāná to describe something whose feet are “turned upward,” perhaps the upside-down  world tree with its roots above. We take the more common approach in seeing here  an image of birth or possibly sexual availability. But then whose feet are these? If  the answer is inside the hymn, then it might be the goddess Aditi, who appears in  verse 4 and is a mother of the gods in verses 8–9. Or again, since “what exists” (sát)  is said to have arisen from “what does not exist” (ásat) in verses 2 and 3, there is per  
haps an implied identification of “the one whose feet were opened up” with “what  does not exist.” Whoever or whatever the uttānápad may be, the term also contains  an oblique reference to the lower aráṇī, one of the pieces of wood used to kindle  the sacrificial fire. See, for example, III.29.3ab addressing the priests, uttānā́yām áva  bharā cikitvā́n, sadyáḥ právītā vŕ̥ṣaṇaṃ jajāna “Attentive, bear down upon her who  is opened up (uttānā́) [=the lower fire-churning stick]. Impregnated on this day, she  has given birth to the bull [=Agni].” That is to say, the appearance of fire from the  fire-churning wood replicates the emergence of “what exists” from “what does not  exist.”  
In verse 4cd the poet describes the paradoxical birth of Aditi from Dakṣa and  Dakṣa from Aditi. Aditi is not only a goddess, but also a principle, the principle of  Innocence or Offenselessness against the gods. Likewise, Dakṣa can be a god per sonifying ritual Skill. Their birth from one another may signify the mutual depen dence of freedom from offense against the gods and ritual skill, both of which are  necessary to carry out the sacrifice. Similarly, there may also be reference to the sac rifice in verse 5d, in which the gods are said to be amŕ̥tabandhavaḥ. The compound  can mean that the gods are kin of the “immortal” Soma or Agni or that they are kin  “to immortality” or that they are connected to the immortal waters (Falk 1994: 13).  There are possible references to the ritual or ritual mythology in the succeeding  

verses as well. Thus, in 6d tīvrá, “sharp” or “bitter,” is a typical description of soma.  Or again in 7a the Yatis are ritual priests, whose death resulted in the rains that swell  “the living worlds” (cf. Jamison 1991: 111). And finally in 7cd the sun in the waters  can be a figure describing soma (cf. Oberlies 1999: 164–65) or fire.  
The last two verses describe the birth of immortals, Aditi’s “seven sons,” with  whom she went to the ancient generation of gods (vs. 9ab), and the birth of mortals,  who are born from a “dead egg” (Hoffmann 1976b [=1992: 723]), a divine miscar riage, both “for procreation” and “for death” (9cd).  
As a cosmology the hymn invites comparison with X.129.
