अहं दाम् ' इत्येकादशर्चं सप्तमं सूक्तम् । वैकुण्ठ एवर्षिर्देवता च । द्वितीयैकादश्यौ त्रिष्टुभौ । शिष्टा जगत्यः । अनुक्रान्तं च - ‘ अहं दामन्त्योपाद्ये च ' इति । द्वितीये रात्रिपर्याये मैत्रावरुणस्येदं सूक्तम् । सूत्रितं च -- अहं दां पाता सुतमिन्द्रो अस्तु सोमम्' (आश्व. श्रौ. ६. ४) इति ॥

Indra Vaikuṇthạ  
Indra Vaikuṇṭha  
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 2, 11  
Like the preceding hymn (X.48), this is an ātmastuti or self-praise spoken by Indra,  with relentless repetition of 1st-person singular pronouns and verbs. For the for mer, note that of the twenty half-verses (excluding the final summary verse 11),  sixteen begin with ahám “I” and one with mā́m “me.” Only three (6c, 7c, and 10c)  lack such an initial pronoun, and 7c has the enclitic mā “me” in second position  (yán mā), while 10c begins with spārhám, a rhyme form to ahám.  
As for verbs, the hymn is dominated by the injunctive, with nearly twenty such  forms. This morphological skewing contrasts with the patterns in the preceding  hymn, which has a wider range and more balanced selection of tenses and moods.  The reasons for the prominence of the injunctive are not clear to us and, somewhat  surprisingly, Hoffmann fails to treat this hymn systematically in his monograph on  that verbal form (Hoffmann 1967).  
Like X.48 this hymn particularly celebrates Indra’s martial successes and the aid  he gave various mortal clients in subduing their enemies. Several of these vignettes  are little known, if at all, and others are quite obscurely phrased (e.g., vs. 3, though it  treats the well-known saga of Kutsa, Śuṣṇa, and, probably, Uśanā Kāvya; vs. 6). The  hymn also emphasizes, more than X.48, the importance of the sacrifice in strengthen  
ing Indra and securing his help: verse 1 announces this theme quite clearly, and verses  4–7 treat the relationship between sacrificer and Indra as well, though not as clearly. The final verse (11) summarizes Indra’s own speech, before addressing him directly  and assuring him that the deeds he himself boasted of will also be praised by  singers.
