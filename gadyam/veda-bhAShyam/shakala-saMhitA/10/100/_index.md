All Gods  
Duvasyu Vāndana  
12 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 12  
The most salient characteristic of this hymn is its full-pāda refrain, found in the  first eleven of its twelve verses: “we choose wholeness (sarvátātim) and innocence  (áditim).” (Geldner takes the latter as the proper name of the goddess Aditi, from  whom we wish to obtain our choice, but not only is there no Ādityan flavor to this  hymn, but such a double accusative construction is otherwise unknown with the  root √vR̥“choose.”) At first, with its abstract and somewhat moral cast, this refrain  seems unrelated to the content of the verses in which it is placed, but as the hymn  proceeds its relevance becomes clearer.  
The hymn begins with a celebration of the soma sacrifice and the gods who par take of it, especially Indra (vs. 1) and Vāyu (vs. 2)—the latter marking the ritual as  the Morning Pressing—with Savitar, the “Impeller,” providing the impetus to the  ritual activity (vss. 1, 3). But it slowly becomes clear that the sacrifice is not simply  a physical procedure, but is intimately bound up with our emotional well-being (see  esp. vss. 5c and 6c). Moreover, in verse 7 it becomes the site of our declaration of  innocence before the gods, a sort of “truth formulation,” though without all the  formal marks of the truth formulation. At this point the refrain becomes an integral  part of the verse to which it is attached. Having thus affirmed our blamelessness, we  can now ask for the dangers that beset us to be banished (vss. 8–9) and for prosperity  and healing to attend us (vs. 10). That the soma sacrifice is the setting for these pleas  and that the elements of the ritual facilitate their fulfillment is shown by the promi  
nence of the pressing stones (vss. 8–9) and the mixing milk for the soma (vs. 10). The happy conclusion of the sacrifice is depicted in verse 11, the last verse with the  refrain. The final verse (12), in a different meter, is a somewhat curious mixture. The first  half is addressed to an unidentified referent—quite possibly Agni, since the compound  “having bright radiance” is ordinarily used of him (though once of Indra and once  of Savitar)—with a slightly sinister reminder slipped into the second pāda that there  are still enemies around who are thriving. The second half looks like a fragment of a  dānastuti, but there are no further clues as to how it might fit into the rest of the hymn.
