' अक्षीभ्याम् ' इति षडृचं द्वादशं सूक्तमानुष्टुभम् । कश्यपगोत्रोत्पन्नो विवृहा नामर्षिः । यक्ष्मनाशनप्रतिपाद्यत्वात्तद्देवताकं कृत्स्नं सूक्तम् । अनुक्रान्तं च -अक्षीभ्यां विवृहा काश्यपो यक्ष्मघ्नम् ' इति । लैङ्गिको विनियोगः ।।

Against Disease  
Vivrhan K ̥ āśyapa  
6 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Like X.161, this is another charm against disease with Atharvan parallels (AVŚ II.33, AVP IV.7). This hymn provides us with what we might term a body-part  litany. The officiant declares the removal of disease from a series of related body  parts in each verse, each associated with a particular area of the body—another  valuable window on how Vedic peoples divided up and named reality. Although the  names of the more standard body parts (eyes, ears, etc.) are well known and have  well-established cognates, the identification of some of the more obscure terms is  uncertain, though the locational association narrows the range of possibilities.
