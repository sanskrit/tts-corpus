Waters  
Triśiras Tvāṣṭra or Sindhudvīpa Āmbarīṣa  
9 verses: gāyatrī, except triṣṭubh 8–9  
The last four verses of this hymn (6–9) are identical with I.23.20–23 (save for the  absence of I.23.20d) and treat the healing and expiatory properties of the Waters,  who provide healing remedies (vss. 6–7) while also carrying away the detritus of  moral misbehavior (vs. 8). The paradox of “fire in the waters” (as embodied else  
where in the figure of Apām Napat “Child of the Waters,” identified with Agni) is  also alluded to in verses 6 and 8. The healing and life-giving qualities of the Waters  are also found in the two preceding verses (4–5).  
The first three verses of the hymn stand somewhat apart from the remainder of  the hymn and progress from the bland and generic to a rather surprising conclusion.  Verse 1 simply describes the Waters as refreshing and asks them for nourishment  

and happiness. In verse 2 the refreshment is specified as juice or sap (rása) and  implicitly compared to breast milk, since the Waters themselves are compared to  mothers. And then there is the very puzzling verse 3, which can only be understood  as an enlargement of that simile, for it is said that the Waters “animate and beget  us.” But even more puzzling than their apparent role in giving birth to “us” is their  purpose in so doing: so that we will go to be “fit” for the dwelling of an unidentified  third party. This third party is generally assumed, most likely correctly, to be the  patron of the sacrifice, and the poet/sacrificer calls upon the Waters to (re)vivify  him, send him to the house of the patron, and make him fit to render service to this  patron in the form of hymns and ritual labor—but the stark economy with which  this sentiment is expressed challenges the modern interpreter.
