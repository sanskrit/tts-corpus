Indra and Varuṇa  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
Though immediately preceding the great Indra–Varuṇa dialogue hymn IV.42, with  its themes of contested sovereignty and complementary divine and human royal functions, this hymn, also dedicated to Indra and Varuṇa, is a relatively simple and  straightforward joint praise of and appeal to the two divinities as an undifferenti ated pair. The poet speaks repeatedly of his desire for the friendship and compan ionship of the two gods, repeatedly asks them for their help, and seeks material gain  from them as well. Although the gods are not treated separately, the contents reflect  Indra’s qualities more than Varuṇa’s, for the two are especially beseeched for aid in  defeating rivals in contest and battles (vss. 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, with imagery derived from  contests in vss. 8–9).

Indra and Varuṇa The patterning of the names of the two gods is mildly interesting. It is fairly strict for the first half of the hymn but varies considerably in the 2nd. The first 5 vss.

have a discontinuous dual dvandva opening the first pāda, either as voc. índrā … varuṇā (1a, 4a, 5a) or nom./acc. índrā … váruṇā (nom. 3a, acc. 4a). The next vss.

break the pattern, but the variation starts slowly: vs. 6 (the central vs. of the hymn) does contain the pāda-initial nom. dual dvandva but postponed until the 2nd hemistich (6c). But then vs. 7 omits the names altogether. The names reappear in vs. 8, but in the final pāda and not as a dual dvandva but as a pāda-initial discontinuous individual sg. acc. phrase: 8d índram … váruṇam. The same individual acc. phrase (now continuous but not pāda initial) is found in 9a. Vs. 10 again omits the names. The final vs. returns to a discontinuous pāda-initial voc. phrase, but only in the b pāda and with singulars not dual: índra … varuṇa. Thus the 2nd half of the hymn appears to treat the gods separately rather than as a unit, but I see no reflection of this separation in the content of the hymn: the two do not display their individual characteristics more in the 2nd half.
