Agni Belonging to All Men [Agni Vaiśvānara]  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
15 verses: triṣṭubh  
A very difficult and enigmatic hymn: this is not surprising because its subject seems  to be poetic speech, its hidden meanings and its mysterious sources, so that the  form of the hymn replicates its theme. The signature word is padám, which occurs  six times in the hymn (vss. 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12); it is a significant pun, meaning both  “track/footstep” and “word,” and in the full phrase “hidden track of the cow”  (padám...gór ápagūḷham, vs. 3) it refers to the arduous pursuit of cryptic meaning  by way of verbal art. As often when R̥gvedic poets reflect on their craft, this poet  wonders about the source of his own poetic inspiration and worries about the skills  of other poets. Although some scholars consider this hymn to reflect a poetic con test, we do not see a formal contest here, but simply the usual anxiety about poetic  rivals. This poet identifies the source of his poetic gift as the god Agni (vss. 2–3, also  12), who bestowed this vision on him, though he was just a simple man (vss. 2, 6).  He puzzles over the fact that thoroughly evil men can nonetheless also have the gift  of poetry (vss. 4–5), but decides that because he (the poet) is morally uncompro  
mised, Agni will shoulder the extra burden of bringing his (the poet’s) poetic vision  to success (vs. 6). When he returns to the rival poets in verse 14, he is full of scorn  for their talent: the patronage of Agni has clearly spelled the difference for our poet.  
The exact middle of the hymn (vss. 7–8, esp. 7cd) is an omphalos, which dis plays in daunting fashion the control the poet has gained, thanks to Agni, over the  encrypted mysteries of the sacrifice and its verbal expression. Verse 7 ends with  the impossible hapax jábāru. There have been various attempts to interpret and  etymologize this word, beginning with Yāska, but in our opinion this is beside the  point: the word is a sort of abracadabra, a mystical expression, and the half verse  

in which it appears encapsulates the profound and transformative secret of the sac rifice. This secret is under the protection of Agni in verse 8, but the poet has learned  at least some of it.  
The following two verses (9–10) reflect on the dawn ritual and the kindling of the  sacrificial fire then, though the mysteries are rather easier to penetrate than those in  the omphalos verses. The poet then expresses hope for gifts from Agni in exchange  for his own formulation of the truth (vs. 11) and asks somewhat nervous questions  about how and whether he will gain these gifts (vss. 12–13). As already noted, verse  14 heaps scorn on rival poets with fewer verbal skills. The final verse is conventional  praise of Agni, expressed in the aorist of the immediate past, indicating that the  morning ritual and the hymn have come to an end.  
Another Vaiśvānara hymn, VI.9, follows much the same trajectory as this one,  with similar reflections on the craft of poetry and the inspiration received from Agni.
