गर्भे न्विति पंचर्चं षष्ठं सूक्तं वामदेवस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभं । अंत्या शक्करी षट्पंचाशदक्षरा। श्येनो देवता । पूर्वसूक्तेऽष्टौ वेत्युक्तत्वादंत्याया इंद्रो वा देवता। तथा चानुक्रांतं । गर्भे नु पंचांत्या शक्करीति ॥ श्येने निष्केवल्यशस्त्र इदं सूक्तं । सूत्रं तु पूर्वमुदाहृतं ॥

27 (323)  
Falcon (1–4), Falcon or Indra (5) [Soma-Theft]  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 5  
The second of the pair of hymns devoted to the soma-theft, this one is told from  Soma’s point of view, with Soma speaking the first two verses (again, in our opin ion), in which Soma engages in some ātmastuti of his own. He boasts of his own  knowledge (vs. 1ab) and power (vs. 2ab), but also in almost breathlessly abrupt  fashion relates the sudden appearance of the falcon, his rescuer (vs. 1d) from con finement (vs. 1b). Asserting that he was complicit in his escape (vs. 2ab), he then  describes their departure, including that of Plenitude (see the introduction to the  last hymn).  
The next two verses (3–4) freeze the dramatic moment when the archer Kr̥śānu,  guardian of Soma, shoots at the fleeing falcon with his precious cargo, and man ages only to shoot off one feather. The final verse (5) depicts Indra about to drink  the soma, now ritually prepared and offered by the priests. In keeping with the  archery theme, the verb used of Indra’s approach to the soma is an idiom (práti √dhā) ordinarily used of fixing an arrow to a bowstring and aiming it at the target.

(323) Falcon (1-4), Falcon or Indra (5) [=Soma theft] Note the periodic punctuation by ádha (1d, 3a, 4d, 5a) -- and some play with that word: ádhi 4b, adhva... 5c, ándhah 5b, maybe adīyam 1d; also the preponderance of a-init. preverbs, ánu 1a, ápa 2a, abhí 2b, áva 3a, 3c.

The perfect jabhāra is found in vss. 2 and 4 (cf. the pres. stem forms to √bhṛ in the preceding hymn, vss. 4-7). It thus frames the central vs. 3, which could then be an omphalos. That vs. is certainly confused enough to qualify and captures the crucial moment of the grabbing of soma. But since vs. 3 consists of a series of subordinate clauses whose main clause is found in vs. 4, it cannot be syntactically isolated into a free-standing omphalos.

These are the famous hymns devoted to the stealing of soma from heaven.

Unfortunately they are very obscure in many details, esp. IV.27. The myth and these hymns are treated in detail by U. Schneider, Der Somaraub des Manu (1971).
