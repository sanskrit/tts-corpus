Indra  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
24 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
This long final hymn of the Indra cycle of Maṇḍala IV is, in contrast to the earlier  hymns in this cycle, quite straightforward for most of its length. The poet urges  Indra to come to us, with help and gifts, and promises praises of his great deeds  (though the celebration of his specific deeds within the hymn is cursory—consisting  of part of vs. 10) and oblations.  
Toward the end of the hymn, the requests for gifts become specific (esp. the tr̥ca  of vss. 17–19) and somewhat peremptory (see esp. vs. 20). These verses (17–21)  have the “feel” of a dānastuti, though they are without doubt addressed to Indra.  The real dānastuti occupies the last tr̥ca (vss. 22–24), though the praise of Indra’s  gifts in the preceding verses obviously serves as model for the human patron. These  last three verses, and especially the middle verse 23, are quite opaque and, like  many dānastutis, contain slangy expressions and words belonging to a different,  and lower, linguistic register. All three verses praise “the two brown ones,” and the  first of the verses announces itself as a formal praśasti (panegyric), with the verbal  lexeme prá...śáṃsāmi. The referent of the two brown ones is unclear. The default  assumption is horses, but the very peculiar verse 23 casts considerable doubt on  this interpretation. We will not rehearse here the many strained interpretations of  verse 23 (among which are some that concern puppets, some eyeballs) and simply  provide our own. We suggest that the “two brown ones” are the two breasts of a  woman given to the poet as a gift (along with cows and the like). (For what we take  as similar praise of a gift-woman’s breasts in a dānastuti, see VIII.2.42.) In verse 23  the poet compares the now-bared breasts to dolls on a post (the slender trunk of the  woman, presumably), and the travels he refers to in verses 23–24 are, in our inter pretation, their movements during sex. Although this interpretation is not entirely  

secure, the competing interpretations are even less so, and the prurient nature of  our suggested contents would fit the marked linguistic register of the dānastuti.
