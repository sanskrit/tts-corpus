‘एष स्य भानुः' इति सप्तर्चं त्रयोदशं सूक्तम् । आदितः षट् जगत्यः सप्तमी त्रिष्टुप् । मण्डलद्रष्टा वामदेव ऋषिः । अश्विनौ देवता । एष स्य त्रिष्टुबन्तम् ' इति ह्यनुक्रान्तम् । प्रातरनुवाकाश्विनशस्त्रयोर्जागते छन्दसीदं शस्यम् । तथा च सूत्रितम्- अबोध्यग्निर्ज्म एष स्य भानुः' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ४. १५) इति ॥

Vāmadeva Gautama  
7 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7  
This hymn represents the culmination of the chariot-journey sequence in the three  Aśvin hymns of Maṇḍala IV. In IV.43 the poet began by asking who among the gods  will listen to his prayers and come to him with aid. Having identified the Aśvins  as his target, he briefly describes their chariot and its journey and announces its  arrival. In IV.44 the poet once again calls the chariot and the Aśvins to his sacrifice  and urges them to avoid the sacrifices of others.  
Here in this hymn (IV.45), the Aśvins’ chariot journey is depicted as happening  simultaneously with the performance of the sacrifice, and in fact the two realms  are to some extent conflated. Their chariot(s) and horses behave in the same way  and are described with the same verb (vs. 2ab) as the beam of the kindled ritual fire  (vs. 1a), and the Aśvins both come bringing honey and come for the honey offered  them. (Honey is a leitmotif throughout the hymn, occurring at least once in each  of the first five verses.) The ritual is also depicted in more detail than in the last two  hymns: see the actions of the priest in verses 5ab and 7d. Moreover, the exact time  at which the journey and the sacrifice are happening, namely dawn, is repeatedly  mentioned (vss. 2, 4, 5), and the other light sources associated with the break of day  have their place in the hymn: the ritual fires (1a, 5ab) and the sun (vss. 2, 6).  
As in the other two Aśvin hymns in this series, Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun,  is present not merely in mythological memory but in the present, ritual time—but  in this hymn she is not mentioned by name. Instead, an ingenious turn of phrase  “three ...are on (the chariot) as a pair” in verse 1 must refer to the pairing of the  two Aśvins with Sūryā, especially since the word for “pair” mithuná is regularly  used for a sexual pairing. Her anonymous appearance in the first verse of the hymn  suggests the fertile fruitfulness that the overflowing honey in the rest of the hymn  also represents.  
The final verse of the hymn formulaically celebrates the Aśvins’ chariot, and  this verse sums up not merely this hymn but the triad of Aśvin hymns that it closes.
