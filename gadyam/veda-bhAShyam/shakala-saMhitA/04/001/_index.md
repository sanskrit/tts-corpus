Agni  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
20 verses: triṣṭubh, except aṣṭi 1, atijagatī 2, dhrti 3 ̥  
This long and complex hymn contains an important account of the Vala myth: the  opening of the cave containing the imprisoned cows and their release. Although the  

hero of this myth is, of course, ordinarily Indra, he does not appear in the hymn,  even in disguised fashion. Instead, the troop that usually aids him in this exploit,  the Aṅgirases, receive all the credit, though they are not mentioned by name. The  absence of Indra can presumably be ascribed to the fact that this is a hymn to Agni;  the larger question is why the Vala myth is appropriate to an Agni hymn. Here the  answer must be the connection of both gods with the dawn: the ruddy Vala cows are  regularly identified as the dawns, and the ritual fire is kindled at dawn. Indeed the  Vala myth in this hymn is introduced by a reference to Agni’s primordial birth (vs.  11), and the (unnamed) Aṅgirases are identified as his begetters (vs. 12): perhaps  they free the embryonic Agni enclosed “in the nest of the bull” (vss. 11–12) as they  do the Vala cows. We have seen the connection between the birth of the ritual fire  and the Vala myth elsewhere, for example, in III.31, an Indra hymn, where it was  also mediated by dawn.  
The Vala myth is embedded within verses more conventionally devoted to Agni.  The first five verses address Agni directly. He is first reminded of his original instal lation by the gods and their purpose in so doing (vs. 1), and in the next four verses  Agni is urged to use his closeness to Varuṇa in order to intercede for us mortals  with that god. The next four verses praise Agni in the 3rd person, concentrating on  his present state. Verses 10–12 form the transition to the Vala myth; in fact verse  10 might seem to go naturally with 6–9, but, with its reference to the treasure of  the gods, it forms a ring with verse 18, which closes the Vala section. The heart of  the Vala narrative consists of verses 13–17. The final two verses (19–20) provide a  summarizing praise of Agni.

Agni I do not understand the emphasis on Varuṇa in the early parts of the hymn (vss. 2-5; see also 18d), since the Vala myth and the unnamed Aṅgirases in the later parts of the hymn have no obvious conceptual connection with Varuṇa and the Ādityas (see also Aditi in 20a).
