Vāmadeva Gautama  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
The most salient feature of this hymn is the insistent series of questions that domi nate its first six verses. These questions all concern the sacrificers’ relationship to  Indra—which sacrificers have managed to attract and please Indra, how does Indra  know who is sacrificing and where, who receives Indra’s bounty and comradeship  and by what means. A preliminary and oblique answer is given in the second half  of verse 4: “the god will take cognizance of my truths,” that is, my praise and sacred  formulations, which will ensure that Indra will come to our sacrifice and share his  bounty. This answer is elaborated upon in the last verses of the hymn. After this  partial answer in verse 4 the questions take on a more intimate tone, inquiring into  the nature of Indra’s friendship with his worshipers, who are now his comrades,  whereas the first four verses were more concerned with the mechanics of attracting  Indra to our particular sacrifice. A striking feature of these question verses is that,  despite the poet’s eagerness for the presence and intimate comradeship of Indra,  the god is always referred to in the 3rd person, and indeed the poet and sacrificers  are almost always in the 3rd person as well. This 3rd-person distancing of Indra  reminds us somewhat of the doubts expressed about Indra’s existence or at least his whereabouts in other R̥gvedic hymns; the 3rd-person reference suggests that the  poet has not established the direct personal contact with the god that he desires. Verse 7 serves as a transition to the amplified answers of verses 8–10. In verse  7 Indra prepares to destroy “the lie,” the deceit that is inimical to the proper func tioning of the cosmos. After Indra’s destruction of the lie, the ubiquitous and  all-powerful force of “truth” can be celebrated in the remaining verses (8–10, before  the refrain verse 11). These three verses contain twelve instances of the word r̥tá “truth,” most of them initial in their pāda. As Paul Thieme illuminatingly pointed  out (1964: 30), r̥tá is the implicit answer to the questions posed earlier—the “how?”  questions answered with “by means of truth,” the “which sacrificer?” questions by  “the one who produces truth.” And we already saw that r̥tá as the answer was fore shadowed in the middle of the hymn (vs. 4cd). Thus we can satisfactorily resolve the  apparent lack of connection between the first two-thirds of the hymn, with its bar rage of questions about Indra and the sacrifice, and the last third, with its insistently  repeated “truth” and absolutely no mention of Indra, that led the Anukramaṇī to  suggest the possibility of two different divinities for the hymn (Indra 1–7, 11; R̥ta  8–10). Indra by destroying the lie (vs. 7) gave free rein to the workings of truth  described in verses 8–10.
