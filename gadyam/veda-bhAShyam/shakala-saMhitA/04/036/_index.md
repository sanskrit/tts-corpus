‘ अनश्वो जातः' इति नवर्चं चतुर्थं सूक्तमार्भवम् । ऋषिर्वामदेवः। अन्त्या त्रिष्टुप् शिष्टास्त्रिष्टुबन्तपरिभाषया जगत्यः । अनश्वोऽन्त्या त्रिष्टुप् ' इत्यनुक्रमणिका । आभिप्लविके तृतीयेऽहनि वैश्वदेवशस्त्रे आर्भवनिविद्धानीयमिदम् । तथा च सूत्रितम् - अनश्वो जातः परावतो य इति वैश्वदेवम् ' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ७. ७ ) इति ॥

R̥bhus  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 9  
The first half of this hymn turns on the “proclamation” of the divinity of the R̥bhus  and of their deeds (vss. 1, 3, 5) and the second on the prosperity they bring. The  first verse already establishes the central themes of the hymn. The chariot with three  wheels that rolls through space is likely the ritual with its three fires or possibly with  its three soma-pressings. And just as the ritual flies from earth to heaven, so the  R̥bhus prosper both earth and heaven.  
The ritual is key to the R̥bhus, since it is through their ritual acts that they became  divine, and they continue to perform ritual acts, even as divinities. Verse 2 again refers  to their perfect chariot—the perfect ritual that the R̥bhus carried out through their  insight. Because they rode to heaven on that ritual, they are now offered soma at the  Third Pressing (2cd). Verses 3–4 rehearse three of the well-known deeds of the R̥bhus,  which are united by a sonic repetition: they rejuvenate their parents in order for them  “to keep going” (caráthāya); in order to make the four principal soma offerings at the  Third Pressing they “divided” one “cup into four” (ví cakra camasáṃ cáturvayam); and  “out of a cowhide” (cármaṇaḥ) they made a milk-giving cow. The cowhide in 4b may  be a hide on which the stalks of the soma plant are beaten (the adhiṣavaṇacarman)  to produce the soma juice. Since at the Third Pressing the stalks used in the first two  pressings are beaten again to extract the soma juice, therefore the great deed of the  R̥bhus might have been that they were able to extract more soma juice on the cowhide  from old stalks and in that way make the cowhide into a cow once again, who gives  soma as its milk. Or the cowhide may refer to the soma stalks themselves, the shredded  remains of the previous pressings that are made to yield soma once again.  
In the second half of the hymn (vss. 5–9) the poet turns principally to the rewards  that the R̥bhus bring. The poet announces the theme in verse 5 by proclaiming that  those whom the R̥bhus help have “wide boundaries”—broad horizons, we might  say. Great men, whether poets or warriors, are great because of the R̥bhus (vs. 6),  and through the R̥bhus people gain wealth (5a, 6c, 8d), vigor (8d), fame (5a, 9bc),  and descendants (9a).
