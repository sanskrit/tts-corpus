‘ को अद्य' इत्यष्टर्चं चतुर्थं सूक्तं वामदेवस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभमैन्द्रम् । तथा चानुक्रान्तं-- ‘ को अद्याष्टौ' इति । दशरात्रे चतुर्थेऽहनि माध्यंदिने सवने स्तोमवृद्धौ मैत्रावरुणशस्त्रे आरम्भणीयाया उपरिष्टादिदं सूक्तमावपनीयं च । सूत्रितं च- स्तोमे वर्धमाने को अद्य नर्यः' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ७, १२ ) इति ॥

Indra  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Although this hymn is superficially organized like IV.23, with a series of questions  in the first part of the hymn that are answered in the second part, it lacks the struc tural subtlety of IV.23, where the answers to the questions are implied, not stated,  and the questions themselves are quite varied. In this hymn the first three verses  pose a set of questions about the sacrificer, all but one (kásya “whose?” in vs. 3c)  introduced by nominative káḥ “who?” The benefits that accrue to the sacrificer so identified are detailed in most of the rest of the hymn (vss. 4–7), benefits highlighted  by the corresponding ill fate of the non-presser and non-giver described in verses  6–7. The hymn ends (vs. 8) with a comprehensive list of all who call upon Indra.  
A salient feature of this hymn is the focus on the various kinds of relationships  a mortal may have with Indra: especially comradeship (vss. 1, 2, 6, 7), but also fel lowship (literally yoke-fellowship, vs. 2), brotherhood (vs. 2), friendship (vs. 6), and  kinship (vs. 6).
