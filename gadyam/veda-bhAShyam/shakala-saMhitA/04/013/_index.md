13 (309)  
Agni (or Assorted Divinities)  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The Anukramaṇī assigns this hymn either to Agni or to unspecified divinities, but  as has long been recognized, it is really a hymn appropriate to dawn, mentioning  the gods associated with this time of day: Dawn herself, the Aśvins, Savitar, and  especially the Sun, who is found in all five verses. It forms a pair with the following  hymn, IV.14, also devoted to Dawn though not so identified. For further on the  similarities of these two hymns, see the introduction to IV.14.  
The last three verses are especially striking, with several vivid images of the tri umph of light over darkness in verses 3–4, and in the final verse (5) a speculative  question about the sun—why does it not fall out of the sky?

As is generally recognized, these two hymns form a pair, and though nominally dedicated to Agni, they are really dawn hymns, with mention of the various divinities appropriate to the dawn sacrifice: Agni, Uṣas, Aśvins, Savitar, Sūrya. The patterning between the hymns gives us one of our rare opportunities to observe how Rigvedic variation-on-a-theme worked in practice, similar to the first few pairs of Vālakhilya hymns.. See the brief remarks in Bloomfield, Rig-Veda Repetitions, p. 13. For a more detailed account of the parallelisms see published introduction. to IV.14 and comments on individual vss. in 14 below. The hymns are most alike at the beginning and end with the middle a fairly free zone. This pattern is similar to what is found in the paired Vālakhilya hymns. See comm. thereon and esp. on VIII.50.
