Indra  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
Until the end, this hymn focuses almost entirely on the Vr̥tra-slaying and espe cially on the release of the waters after the slaying. In the first two verses Indra  is chosen, by the gods and the world-halves, for the task, and he assumes the  kingship. The actual slaying and the splitting of the mountains to set the waters  free occupy the next verses (through vs. 5), and other feats of Indra regarding  the waters—stopping them for his clients Turvīti and Vayya in verse 6, impreg nating them in verse 7—are mentioned. Indeed, verse 7 lushly depicts the fertile  and fructifying power of liquid in many forms. This main section of the hymn is  brought to a close in verse 8, which efficiently summarizes the main points of the  Vr̥tra myth.  
Verse 9 serves as a somewhat bizarre coda. It celebrates three of Indra’s great  deeds that are regularly mentioned together:  he rescues the shunned son of an  unmarried girl, makes a blind man see, and causes a lame man to walk (cf., e.g.,  II.13.12, 15.7; I.112.8). But here each of these deeds has an odd twist: the boy is  being eaten by female ants; the blind man “takes a serpent” (an unrecoverable pun  or piece of slang, in our view); and the lame man is “broken in the ‘pot’” or “breaks  the pot” (slang for “hip”?). And it is also unclear why this verse has been tacked  onto the end of a hymn that is otherwise remarkably consistent thematically. It may  be that the “unwed girls” (agrū́) in verse 7, a metaphor for the rivers, suggested to  

the poet the episode of the unwed girl (agrū́) who abandons her son out of shame,  and it may also be that this proverbial episode of a mother’s abandonment of her  son resonated with Indra’s own experience with his mother at his birth, treated so  dramatically in the preceding hymn (IV.18).  
The hymn ends with two summary verses (10, 11). In the former the poet  announces to Indra the hymn he has just completed, while the latter is the refrain  verse of the Vāmadeva Indra cycle (see IV.16–17, 20–24).
