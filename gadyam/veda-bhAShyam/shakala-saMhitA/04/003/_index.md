Agni  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
16 verses: triṣṭubh  
In the very last verse of this hymn (16) the poet announces that he has produced  counsels, enigmas, secret words, and poetry for Agni: these verbal products presum ably make up the rest of the hymn. It begins fairly straightforwardly, however, with  a treatment (vss. 1–3) of the kindling of the ritual fire, as so often at the beginning  of Agni hymns. But starting with verse 4 a certain worried tone becomes apparent,  about the relationship between the poet and the god Agni. The next four verses  (5–8) contain anxious questions: what is Agni planning to say to various gods about  us? These questions reflect the uncertainty produced by the ritual model: Agni is the  ritual mediator between men and gods, and so in some sense everything the gods  learn about us mortals is filtered through Agni, who may be—we worry—an unreli  
able witness. The anxiety returns in verses 13–14, especially the former, in which the  poet worries that Agni will punish him for the deeds of his relatives and acquain tances. In between (vss. 9–12) are four verses, each beginning with the charged word  r̥téna “by truth,” introducing a mixture of ritual and mythic activities, including  
one verse (11) on the Vala myth, a preoccupation of the Agni hymns in IV. What ties the various parts of the hymn together is not entirely clear, and it  may be that the poet’s final verse, listing several types of verbal material, is meant  to indicate that the hymn consists of a disparate collection of his works, although  attempting to assign those labels to the different parts of the hymn would probably  be taking the conceit too far.
