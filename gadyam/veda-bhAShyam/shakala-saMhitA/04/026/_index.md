26 (322)  
Indra (1–3), Praise of Falcon (4–7) [Soma-Theft]  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The next two hymns treat the famous myth of the theft of Soma from heaven. Soma  was being held captive in a well-fortified citadel there, guarded by an archer named  Kr̥śānu. A falcon carried him off by stealth, and though shot at by Kr̥śānu, the  bird only lost a single feather (a tale told more fully in several Brāhmaṇa accounts).  Delivered to Manu, the first sacrificer, the soma was then available to be ritually  prepared for Indra, who cannot perform his great deeds without it.  
The first of the two hymns is entirely couched as the speech of Indra (in our  view, though the Anukramaṇī assigns at least vss. 4–7 to the poet Vāmadeva and  takes the first three verses either as Vāmadeva’s speech [impersonating Indra] or  as Indra’s himself). It begins (vss. 1–3) as a standard Indra ātmastuti (self-praise),  with 1st-person boasting about his deeds and identities; see, for example, X.48–49.  (On the ātmastuti in general, see Thompson 1997.) In verse 4 he addresses his usual  warrior band, the Maruts, with a laud of the falcon as the best of birds because of  his soma-stealing exploit, which he then narrates in overlapping sequence (focusing  on the central deed, “he brought [the soma]”) in the remaining three verses (5–7).  The last half of verse 7 alludes glancingly to the associated departure of the shad owy figure Plenitude, the personification (or rather deification) of plenty, a frequent  companion of Soma’s, presumably because of the association of the distribution of  gifts with the performance of the Soma Sacrifice, especially the Morning Pressing.  Judging from verse 7 in this hymn and verses 2–3 in the next one, Plenitude prob  
ably was carried away from heaven at the same time as Soma—though the poet  expresses some doubts in IV.27.3.

Indra (1-3), Praise of the falcon (4-7) [=Soma-theft] As indicated in the published introduction, I believe the whole hymn is spoken by Indra, against the Anukramaṇī but with Geldner (/Witzel Gotō).

These are the famous hymns devoted to the stealing of soma from heaven.

Unfortunately they are very obscure in many details, esp. IV.27. The myth and these hymns are treated in detail by U. Schneider, Der Somaraub des Manu (1971).
