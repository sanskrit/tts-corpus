Dawn  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is remarkable first for the fact that the dawns are always presented and  addressed in the plural (“Dawns”) rather than the singular, as so often. Indeed,  when the poet wishes to refer to a single dawn, he uses instead the word “light”  (vs. 1)  or an unspecified pronoun (vs. 6). The grammatical plurality of the sub  
ject Dawns serves a thematic purpose: as in other dawn hymns the poet notes that  each day’s dawn is different, yet paradoxically all dawns are the same, coming in an  unbroken chain from the east day after day (see, e.g., vs. 8).  
As V. Yareham suggested (in an unpublished paper presented at the University  of Texas Vedic Workshop, May 2007), the hymn is structured around an ompha los verse (6), with concentric matching verses surrounding it: 1–2 / 10–11 and  3–5 / 7–9. The omphalos poses a central and essentially unanswerable question,  the one that always arises about the dawn(s): how can they be both the same  and different, and the poet expresses his anxiety that he cannot identify the  particular dawn in the swarm of identical ones. Behind this anxiety is another  one, seen especially in verses 4, 6, and 7, namely whether we, the current sacrifi cers, will have the same material success with our dawn sacrifice as the ritualists  of old.  
Otherwise, the imagery is of the usual type for dawn hymns:  the brilliant  beauty of the dawns in contrast to the darkness, which they banish; their abrupt  arising in the east and their subsequent journey; and the prayers for largesse,  reminding us that the dakṣiṇā, the priestly gifts, were distributed at the dawn  sacrifice.

Dawn It is worth noting that the nom. (and voc.) pl. of uṣás- is consistently uṣásaḥ in this hymn (every vs. but 10), with short suffixal vowel -- the newer form replacing inherited uṣā́saḥ.

As disc. in the published introduction, this is an omphalos hymn, with the middle verse 6 posing the central question. This omphalos is surrounded by concentric rings: divó duhitáro vibhātī́ḥ of 1c is answered by the same phrase (in the voc.) in 10a and 11a, while vss. 5 and 7 contain an inner ring with ṛtá- (ṛtayúbhiḥ 5a, ṛtájātasatyāḥ 7b) and sadyáḥ (5b, 7d). There is also much lexical chaining between adjacent vss.
