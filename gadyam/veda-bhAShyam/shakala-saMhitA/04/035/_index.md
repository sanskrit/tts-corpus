R̥bhus  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn begins by addressing the R̥bhus with a patronymic Saudhanvan “sons  of Sudhanvan.” This use of the patronymic and thus the emphasis on their birth  accents their original humanity. But through their ritual work, they “went along  the path of immortality” and so entered the community of gods (3cd). The poet returns to this theme also at the end of the hymn in verse 8.  He states that the  R̥bhus became gods through their work (8a) and recalls that they were human— once again through addressing them with their patronymic—before they became  immortal (8d). The concluding verse then invites the divine R̥bhus together with  Indra to receive the soma at the Third Pressing.  
In the middle section of the hymn the poet mentions several of the R̥bhus’ great  deeds (vs. 5), but his focus is on their act of dividing one soma cup into four (vss.  2–4). According to this hymn, Indra alone is the recipient of soma in the Midday  Pressing, but Indra and the three R̥bhus are the principal soma recipients in the  evening (vs. 7). The creation of four cups from one thus marks the transition from  the single soma offering to Indra at midday to the four offerings in the evening and  the institution of the Third Pressing.
