49 (345)  
Indra and Brhaspati ̥  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
This simple hymn is reminiscent of the nearby Vāyu and Indra hymns (IV.46–47),  elementary in diction and simple in purpose, inviting the two divinities to come and  drink the soma. It seems likely that IV.49 was indeed based, somewhat artificially,  on those former hymns, as there is no standard ritual offering of soma to Indra  and Br̥haspati as there is to Indra and Vāyu. Indeed, Br̥haspati does not otherwise  drink soma in the R̥gveda (save for IV.50.10). Evidence for the dependence of this  hymn on Indra and Vāyu hymns is found in the second pāda of verse 3, which is  also found in I.135.7 with the grammatical subjects Indra and Vāyu. The elemen tary and derivative nature of this hymn contrasts strongly with the richness of the  following hymn (IV.50) to the same divinities.

Indra and Bṛhaspati As disc. in the published introduction, this hymn seems to be modeled on the Indra/Vāyu hymns just preceding, esp. since in standard śrauta ritual there is no joint offering of soma to Indra and Bṛhaspati. Like Indra and Vāyu in IV.46.3-7, Indra and Bṛhaspati are consistently addressed with a dual dvandva, índrābṛ́haspátī, which is found only here. (Note the correct dual 1st member índrā, in contrast to índra-vāyū discussed ad IV.46.2.) This dvandva is found as an unaccented voc. in every vs., save for 5, where the fully accented form occurs as an acc. In addition, in 3b there is a headless Vāyav Indraś ca construction, índraś ca, lacking the voc. *bṛ́haspate -- though the preceding pāda does contain voc. indrābṛhaspatī. See further below.
