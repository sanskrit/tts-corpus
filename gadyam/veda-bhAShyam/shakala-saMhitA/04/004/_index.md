Agni the Demon-Smasher  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
15 verses: triṣṭubh  
The Anukramaṇī names Agni Demon-Smasher (Rakṣo-han) as the divinity of this  hymn. This ascription is certainly apt for the first five verses with their vividly hos tile imagery, but starting with verse 6 the benefits that accrue to those who properly  worship Agni are described (vss. 6–10). We identify ourselves as those worshipers  in verses 8–9, and in verse 11 (see also vs. 8) the poet boasts of his hereditary poetic  gifts, which enable him to get the attention and good favor of Agni. He explicitly  identifies the source of his poetic skill as his father Gotama, but implicitly, through  his phraseology, he also identifies himself with the Aṅgirases, the legendary poets  who broke open the treasure cave of Vala, a myth that is much on the mind of the  poet of these Agni hymns in IV (see, e.g., IV.1.13–17; 2.15–17; 3.11). The remaining  verses (12–15) call on Agni to protect us with his protectors (presumably his flames)  and to grant other blessings. The demons return in the last half verse (15cd).
