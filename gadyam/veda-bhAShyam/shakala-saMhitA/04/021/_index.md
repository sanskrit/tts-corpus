Indra  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first verses of this hymn, especially 1 and 3, are quite reminiscent of the open ing of the preceding hymn, IV.20, with the invitation to Indra to come to our sac rifice from wherever he might be, and the hymn promises to be a straightforward  celebration of Indra’s presence at the sacrifice and our praise and offering to him, in  the hopes of his goods and help. But the hymn veers off into a different, and deeply  puzzling, direction. The pivot is verse 5, which begins with a relative clause as does verse 4, leading us to expect that the referent in verse 5 will be the same as in verse  4, namely Indra, the subject of our hymn. But it is not, as the last word reveals, but  rather the Hotar, here almost certainly the god Agni.  
The next three verses (6–8) share a number of features: repeated phrases (espe cially the góhe phrase of 6b, 7c, 8c), metrical irregularity in their odd pādas (6c,  7a, 7c), morphological and syntactic parallelism, and patterns of phonological and  morphosyntactic repetition. But what they especially share is almost impenetrable  obscurity. In our admittedly speculative interpretation, these verses take off from  the Agni verse (5) and treat simultaneously the kindling of the ritual fire, which  initiates the sacrifice here and now, and the Vala myth. As we noted in the introduc tion to IV.20, the twin of this hymn in some ways, the Vala myth, is a backgrounded  model for Indra’s generous giving in that hymn. It should also be remembered that  the Agni hymns of this maṇḍala frequently take the Vala myth as their subject (see  esp. IV.1 and 2), despite the fact that Agni is not usually a participant in that myth.  Thus a condensed version of the Vala myth embedded in an Indra hymn but focus ing on Agni is compatible with the larger concerns of the Vāmadeva poets.  
In verse 6 the gods coming to the sacrifice seem to be compared to the Aṅgirases  going to the Vala cave—though neither group is mentioned by name—and the seat  of both groups is identified as the “secret place” (góha) of the Auśija, a vr̥ddhi  derivative that we interpret as referring to the whole company of Uśij-priests, or  fire-priests. In the second half of the verse the ritual fire is kindled, though with  difficulty. The kindled fire roars to life in verse 7a, enabling the sacrifice to proceed  (pāda b) and the cows in the Vala cave to go forth (pādas cd)—expressed in increas ingly compressed phraseology. The final verse of this section (8) is the one that most  clearly alludes to the opening of the Vala cave, using several of the signature words  of that myth, including the verb vidát “found, finds,” which several times in the Vala  myth takes “cows” as object (I.62.3, V.45.8, X.68.11). But in our verse the object is  omitted, presumably to allow the simultaneous reading “cows” (for the Vala myth)  and “goods” (for the ritual here-and-now).  
Having thus provided Indra with a mythic model for generous giving (however  cryptically phrased), the poet then reproaches Indra in verse 9 for not participating  in the sacrificial give-and-take. The poet ends the hymn with a more conventional  summary verse and plea for goods and help (vs. 10), followed by the Vāmadeva  Indra-cycle refrain (vs. 11).
