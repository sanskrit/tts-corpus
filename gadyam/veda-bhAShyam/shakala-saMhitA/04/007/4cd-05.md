Together these vss. reprise the first vs. (and the beginning of the 2nd).

Agni’s association with the Bhṛgus of 1c is tightened by the adj. of appurtenance bhṛ́gavan- in 4d, and viśé-viśe returns from 1d. In 5a we find ānuṣák as in 2a. The verb ní ṣedire ‘have set down’ (5b), though etym. unrelated, is the transitive equivalent in ritual discourse of dhāyi (1a) ‘has been installed’, and its object Agni is identified as hótāram … yájiṣṭham, the words used of him as subject of dhāyi in vs. 1 (1b hótā yájiṣṭhaḥ). The root √dhā, insistent in 1a dhāyi dhātṛ́bhiḥ, is not absent here: see dhā́mabhiḥ in 5d. Meanwhile the signature root of this section of the hymn is √cit, which appears once in each of the first 5 vss., except for 4: 1d citrám, 2b cétanam, 3a vícetasam, 5b cikitvā́ṃsam.
