‘उप नो वाजाः' इत्यष्टर्चं पञ्चमं सूक्तं वामदेवस्यार्षमार्भवं त्रैष्टुभम्। पञ्चम्याद्याश्चतस्रोऽनुष्टुभः । तथा चानुक्रान्तम्- उप नोऽष्टौ चतुरनुष्टुबन्तम्' इति । व्यूढे दशरात्रे षष्ठेऽहनि वैश्वदेवशस्त्रे आद्याः चतस्रः शस्याः ।  ‘ उप नो वाजा इति त्रयोदशार्भवं चतस्रश्च' (आश्व. श्रौ. ८. ८) इति हि सूत्रितम् ॥

R̥bhus  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
8 verses: triṣṭubh 1–4, anuṣṭubh 5–8  
Meter divides this hymn into two parts: the first half is in trimeter and the second in  dimeter. That might indicate that the two parts were originally two different hymns,  but the two parts show a thematic unity. Running through the hymn is the explicit  and implicit image of the horse, although the meaning of the horse is constantly  

changing. The first verse does not mention a horse, but it invites the R̥bhus to come  in their chariots to the sacrifice, so the horse implicitly carries the R̥bhus. In 4a the  bahuvrīhi pī́voaśva might mean “(having) fat horses,” but we have taken it to refer to  the butter offerings belonging to the R̥bhus, and therefore we have translated “(hav  
ing) horses of fat,” just as the R̥bhus’ “blazing chariots” in the bahuvrīhi śucádratha likely refers to the sacrificial fires. In 4b the R̥bhus themselves are addressed as prize winning horses. The theme then becomes more pronounced in the second half of the  hymn. In verse 5b they are summoned as a team of horses, and in 5d at least one of  them is called a horseman. In verse 6 the sacrificer’s horse, here probably the hymn,  is a steed that makes him a winner. And finally in verse 8 the wealth that the R̥bhus  bring may be a horse, but this verse is problematic and discussed in more detail below.  
One of the lexical features of the hymn is the wording of the invocation to the  Vājas and R̥bhukṣans. These are elliptical plurals. The “Vājas” refers to all three  R̥bhus, who are most commonly named R̥bhu, Vāja, and Vibhvan. “R̥bhukṣan,”  which means “Master of the R̥bhus,” can refer to Indra, but it can also be a  name for one of the R̥bhus, that is, the R̥bhu who is named “R̥bhu.” The plural  R̥bhukṣans here, therefore, are probably again just the three R̥bhus. In verse 5  the poet encodes two R̥bhus in the appellative use of their names: R̥bhu in R̥bhú “craftsman” (5a) and Vāja in vā́ja “prize” (5b). The name of the third R̥bhu,  Vibhvan or Vibhū, does not appear in this verse, or anywhere else in the hymn.  However, he may be the horseman (aśvín) in 5cd, for horses are “wide-ranging”  (vibhú), as in III.6.9b vibhávo hí áśvāḥ “for your horses are wide-ranging.” The  word aśvínam also anticipates the invocation of the Nāsatyas, that is, the Aśvins,  in verse 8. The addition of the Aśvins may point to the use of this hymn in an  Atirātra or Overnight Soma Rite, since in that rite the Aśvins are summoned in  the early morning after the soma-pressing day.  
Verse 3 poses some difficulty because tryudā́ya, here translated “thrice ascend ing,” is a hapax of unsure meaning. Perhaps wisely, Geldner does not try translating  it at all. Sāyaṇa links tri- “three” to the three soma pressings, but the R̥bhus do not  receive soma at the Morning or Midday Pressings. Therefore, while -udā́ya likely  does describe soma pressing (sávana), tri- may refer to three soma offerings to the  three R̥bhus.  
But the most problematic verse is the last, and our interpretation is tentative.  The verse appears to refer to a Horse Sacrifice. In the classical rite the horse is  released to wander through various territories before it is finally sacrificed. Here  the horse is the wealth that the R̥bhus, Indra, and the Aśvins bring from surround  
ing lands. As the sacrificial horse is slaughtered and cut up, so wealth is generously  apportioned to the sacrificers.
