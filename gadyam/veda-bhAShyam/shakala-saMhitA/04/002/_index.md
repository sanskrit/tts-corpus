Agni  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
20 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn shares a number of features, including phraseology, with the previous  one: like IV.1 it begins with the installation of Agni as the mediator of the sacri ficial exchange between men and gods, and it contains a brief, Indra-less account  of the Vala myth (vss. 15–17), with the Aṅgirases explicitly compared to the poets  of today besieging the treasure-holding pen of the sacrifice. However, the first few  verses of the hymn (vss. 2–4) enlarge on Agni’s role as messenger announced in  verse 1. The hymn also contains an elaborate treatment (vss. 6–10, 13–14) of the  various ritual services rendered to Agni by the sacrificers, and Agni is urged to dis tinguish between those who do such service and other mortals (esp. vss. 11–12). The  final two verses (19–20) summarize the fire-worship that has just been performed by the sacrificers, both actions (“we have performed,” vs. 19) and words (“we have  spoken,” vs. 20), a common hymn-ending device. Preceding them is a mysterious  verse (18), whose position suggests that it closes the Vala myth, but whose content  seems at least superficially unconnected.
