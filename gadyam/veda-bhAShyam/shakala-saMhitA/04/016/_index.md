Indra  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
21 verses: triṣṭubh  
This first hymn of the Vāmadeva Indra cycle is rich in mythological material. It  begins with two verses devoted to the journey motif—Indra coming to our soma  sacrifice—but already in the second half of verse 2 and the first half of verse 3 the legendary poet and sage Uśanā Kāvya, who will figure later in the hymn, is intro duced by indirection. The Vala and Vr̥tra myths are interwoven in the next section  of the hymn, verses 3cd through 8, their interpenetration encouraged by the fact  that almost no participants are explicitly named in the earlier part of the section.  The last two verses clearly separate the two myths: verse 7 by naming Vr̥tra, verse 8  by the very words of the dog Saramā and her naming of Indra’s companions in the  Vala myth, the Aṅgirases.  
Verses 9–14 concern the saga of the hero Kutsa, the poet Uśanā Kāvya, and  Indra, a story that is, as usual, narratively elusive. As noted above, Uśanā Kāvya  was introduced earlier in the hymn by name; he is not named in this section, but  deeds involving him in other references to the myth are also found here: Indra and  Kutsa’s joint journey to his house for help (vs. 10ab; cf., e.g., I.130.9) and the help  he provides to their venture (vs. 11), help which elsewhere takes the material form  of the mace he presents to Indra (I.121.12, V.34.2).  
Our version also has the curious motif of the woman who seeks to tell the dif ference between Indra and Kutsa, who have identical appearance (vs. 10cd). This  reminds us of the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa story (JB III.199–200), in which Kutsa was  born from Indra’s thigh and therefore looks identical to Indra. Kutsa takes advan tage of this by having sex with Indra’s wife, who claims, when Indra discovers them  together, not to be able to tell Indra and Kutsa apart. The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa  story appears, at least to us, to have been secondarily generated to explain the enig matic motif in our R̥gvedic verse, which does not suggest any misbehavior on the  part of the truth-distinguishing woman. Certainly Indra and Kutsa in partnership  go on to destroy named and nameless enemies and to tear off the wheel of the Sun’s  chariot (vss. 12–13), an action also prominent, if enigmatic, in other mentions of  this story (I.130.9, I.174.5, V.29.10). A successful act of distinguishing Indra (from  Kutsa?) seems to be alluded to in verse 14b, bringing closure to this motif. This  recognition was aided by the strong light of the sun. It is unclear whether the con tribution of the sun’s light here has anything to do with the damage inflicted on his  chariot by Indra and Kutsa.  
The remainder of the hymn consists of appeals to Indra for help in contests and  battles and for largesse (vss. 15–19), with two closing verses (20–21) summing up the  making of the poem and the hopes we have of it.  
The hymn is full of deep and surface puns, phonological play, and subtle echoes  across verses, and the poet takes some delight in setting up and then frustrating our  grammatical and mythological expectations.
