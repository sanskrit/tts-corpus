Dadhikrā  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
6 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 6  
In this celebratory hymn the very real and physical horse of the preceding hymn  (IV.38) has become a mere recipient of and occasion for a formal encomium. He is  invoked along with a number of gods and thus appears to have achieved a measure  of divinity, but the artistry of IV.38 has been replaced by the deployment of stiff  and conventional formulae. It is, however, interesting to see how an encomium of  this sort, presumably a particular type of occasional verse, would be constructed.

Dadhikrā As was noted in the published introduction, the middle hymn of the small Dadhikrā cycle differs in style and content from the hymns before and after, presenting a formal praśasti-type encomium.
