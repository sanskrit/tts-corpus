Indra  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
21 verses: triṣṭubh, except ekapadā virāj 15  
The hymn begins with the simple declaration “You, Indra, are great,” and in some  sense the rest of the hymn just develops this statement. The first section of the hymn  (vss. 1–8) treats Indra’s deeds in the past (though with some interludes in the pres ent, esp. vs. 5), particularly the Vr̥tra slaying and its cosmic repercussions. Verse 8  sums up this section by detailing the qualities that make Indra worthy of our atten tion. In verses 9–13 Indra’s abilities to conquer foes and win prizes are celebrated  for their present relevance. The following two verses (14 and 15, its stunted single pāda adjunct) make a brief and quite obscure foray into the Etaśa myth. The final  five verses (16–20), before the last (21) repeated from IV.16.21, express our hopes  for Indra’s bounty and aid, and, especially, our longing for him to be in affectionate  relationship with us.  
Several themes surface from time to time in the hymn. Indra is often called  maghávan “bounteous (patron)” throughout (vss. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 [twice], 20), even  though our prayers for goods and services do not become insistent until the end.  More striking is the motif of Indra’s birth and, especially, the uncertainty about  the identity of his father. His birth in mentioned in verses 2, 4, 7, and 12. In verse  4 it is said that Heaven is considered to be his begetter, but “is considered” throws  that statement into question, and it is not even clear whether “the best craftsman,”  to whom the act is (also?) ascribed, is Heaven or not. It may well be Tvaṣṭar, called  “good craftsman” elsewhere (I.85.9) and in apparent parental relationship with  Indra in some passages (e.g., III.48.2–4; see also the next hymn, IV.18.3). Verse 12ab  casts even more doubt on his parentage, which Indra himself seems not to be clear  about. This birth motif foreshadows the next hymn, the famous IV.18 featuring the  direct speech of Indra’s mother at the time of his birth.
