Aśvins  
Purumīḷha Sauhotra and Ajamīḷha Sauhotra  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first four verses of this hymn are filled with questions, with the poet seeking  to identify the god or gods who will be most attentive to him. He begins by casting  his net widely, with any and all gods potentially the answer to his petitions. (These  plural possibilities are signaled grammatically and lexically: katamá “which one?”  [1a, 2a, 2b] explicitly requires a choice from three or more possible answers, and “of  those worthy of the sacrifice” [1a], “among the immortals” [1c], and “of the gods”  [2b] allow these choices to be made from the full set of divinities.) But the questions  soon pick the Aśvins out as the correct answer to the earlier questions. A query  about their chariot (2cd), which the maiden Sūryā chose as her bridal conveyance,  obliquely but uniquely identifies the Aśvins, and the remaining questions (vss. 3–4)  focus on their ability and willingness to aid us.  
With our benefactors now identified as the Aśvins, the next two verses (5–6)  concern their chariot journey (somewhat obscurely), with the announcement of  the first sight of their chariot made in the second half of verse 6. In the final verse, identical to the last verse of IV.44, the poet reminds the gods that he has provided  them with nourishment and asks for their return favor.  
The hymn displays a neat, but uninsistent, ring composition. In verse 1d the poet  asks where to “fix” his praise and offerings to the god, using a form of the root śri;  the same root is found in the final pāda of the hymn (7d), where our desire of the  gods is, reciprocally, “fixed.” This complementarity is emphasized by the two mor  
phologically parallel words that express what we offer to the gods (suṣṭutí “good  praise,” 1d) and what we hope for in return (sumatí “good favor,” 7b). The hymn twice mentions the involvement of the Aśvins (and their chariot) in  the marriage of Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun (vss. 2, 6), the second time in the  present tense coinciding with our own first sight of their chariot. While most refer ences to Sūryā and her marriage in Aśvin hymns are set in the mythic past, in this  short Aśvin cycle (IV.43–45) Sūryā is present with the Aśvins when they come to the  sacrifice, travelling with them on the same chariot (see IV.44.1, 45.1).
