Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
3 verses: br̥hatī 1, triṣṭubh 2, 3  
This hymn marks the raising of the sacrificial fire by placing kindling, by pouring  ghee, and by reciting praises and invocations, which verbal products, as much as  the wood and ghee, bring the fire to life. Noteworthy in this hymn is the repetition  of an emphatic vayám “we” at the beginning of each pāda in verse 2, continuing its  placement in 1d. The poet is drawing the god’s attention not only to the forms of  ritual service he is being offered, but also to the poet and his people as those offer  
ing that service.
