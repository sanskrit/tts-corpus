॥ श्रीगणेशाय नमः ।।

यस्य निःश्वसितं वेदा यो वेदेभ्योऽखिलं जगत् ।

निर्ममे तमहं वन्दे विद्यातीर्थमहेश्वरम् ॥

अथ पञ्चमाष्टके चतुर्थोऽध्याय आरभ्यते । तत्र षडनुवाकात्मकस्य वासिष्ठस्य सप्तमस्य मण्डलस्य तृतीयेऽनुवाके द्वाविंशतिसूक्तानि । तत्र ‘प्र ब्रह्म' इति नवर्चं तृतीयं सूक्तं वसिष्ठस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभं पूर्ववद्वैश्वदेवम् । अनुक्रान्तं च--- प्र ब्रह्म नव ' इति । विनियोगो लैङ्गिकः ॥

All Gods  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
Like many All God hymns, this one allots a verse each to a god or group of gods,  most named, some not named but obvious from their description, and a few  less transparently characterized. The verses whose divinities are clear are 1: Sun;  2: Mitra and Varuṇa; 5: Rudra, 6: Rivers, 7: Maruts (and their mother Pr̥śni?);  8:  Aramati, Pūṣan, and Bhaga; 9:  Maruts and Viṣṇu. For verse 3 some schol  
ars identify the Wind and Parjanya [Thunder] as the dedicands, but we assign  it instead to Soma; verse 4 may belong to both Indra and Aryaman, but we  consider aryamán here to be used as a descriptor of Indra, rather than as the  name of the third member of the Ādityan triad, since the other descriptors—  
strong resolution and confounding of the enemy’s battle fury—are characteristic  of Indra.  
The hymn can also be read as a chronological progress through a sacrifice. In  verse 1 the fire is kindled at dawn and ritual speech is uttered on the ritual ground.  The hymn is mentioned in verse 2, and the preparation of soma in verse 3. The  invitation to Indra to come to the sacrifice with his horses is given in verse 4, and  the actual sacrifice occurs in verse 5. Although the verse to the rivers (6) does not  appear to fit this pattern, it could refer to the waters used to swell the soma stalks  

(see also vs. 3) or to other ritual uses of water. The final three verses (7–9) call upon  the various gods for wealth and progeny.

All Gods As noted in the published introduction, this hymn can be read as a progress through a sacrifice. Renou (EVP IV.97) follows Hillebrandt in seeing it as a “récitation du pressurage vespéral.” Hillebrandt (Myth. II.128 n. 3) in fact considers it as forming, with VII.37.1-7 and VII.38, an old śāstra for the Evening (or Third) Pressing.

Although the focus on Indra and the Ṛbhus in VII.37 does identify that hymn as associated with the Third Pressing, I do not see that association here. The kindling of the ritual fire that climaxes our vs. 1 (d) suggests rather the Morning Pressing, as does the sun’s sending out the cows in 1b (so also Geldner n. 1b). Moreover, most of the gods named in our hymn are not Third Pressing gods; for example, the Maruts, mentioned twice (vss. 7 and 9) are primarily associated with the Midday Pressing, and though the Third Pressing begins with an Āditya cup (which could subsume Mitra and Varuṇa), that pair is prominent in the Morning Pressing and are found here in vs. 2; Sūrya (vs. 1) is certainly not appropriate to the Evening Pressing. As far as I can, VII.36 and VII.37 are ritually independent.
