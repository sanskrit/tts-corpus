Indra and Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
12 verses: gāyatrī 1–11, anuṣṭubh 12, arranged in trcas ̥  
This hymn consists of four sets of tr̥cas, and if each tr̥ca is considered originally a  separate hymn, the principle of arrangement is not violated. There are two main  themes, the varieties of poetic thought and its product, verbal praise, which the  poets address to the two gods, and the hope that these gods will favor these poets  over their rivals (see esp. vss. 3, 7, 8, 12). Despite the emphasis on poetic inspiration,  there seems to be relatively little of it on display in this hymn, which is a bricolage  of quotations from other hymns. The two gods, Indra and Agni, also lack traits,  individually and collectively.

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

Indra and Agni As noted in the published introduction, this hymn is made up of four tṛcas, which were probably originally independent, since four 3-vs. hymns would fit the standard pattern of hymn arrangement, but a single 12-vs. hymn following one with 8 vss.

would not. There is little sign of unity within the separate tṛcas, but the content of the hymn as a whole is so generic that it would be hard to identify features that would either unify or distinguish the various parts. Also, there may be a faint, probably secondary, ring between the 1st vs. (1c) and the last (12d) (see comm. ad vs. 12), which may suggest that the four tṛcas were combined into a single hymn even before the redaction of the Saṃhitā text. The first tṛca (vss. 1-3) also has a faint sign of internal unity: the dual dvandva voc. índrāgnī beginning the b-pāda in each vs. However, the 3rd tṛca (vss. 7-9) also contains the same form in every vs. (7a, 8c, 9c), and 10b also begins with this cmpd., though there it is not a voc. but an acc., and it requires a distracted reading (indrā̆-agnī́-).
