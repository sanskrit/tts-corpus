25 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1–6, 18, 21, 23; anuṣṭubh 25; jagatī or triṣṭubh 7  
This long and rambling hymn coming at the very end of the VIIth Maṇḍala is obvi ously an addition to the original collection, not only on formal grounds but on those  of content. Not a praise hymn, it calls upon a series of gods and other powers to  destroy all manner of threats to us, in all manner of creatively bloodthirsty ways. It  therefore has more in common with what we might term the “instrumental” hymns  of the Atharvaveda than with the R̥gvedic manner, and it is in fact found in almost  identical form as Atharvaveda Śaunaka VIII.4 and in Atharvaveda Paippalāda  XVI. The relentless focus on the elimination of evildoers and the changes rung on  the methods of destroying them can give an impression of homogeneity, despite the  number of different gods called on (mostly Indra and Soma, but with a number of  others interspersed: see the Anukramaṇī ascriptions above).  
Nonetheless smaller divisions can be discerned within the hymn as a whole. The  mood is set by verse 1, with no fewer than eight violent imperatives addressed to  Indra and Soma, urging action against the wicked. The first five verses follow the  same pattern: an initial vocative índrāsomā “o Indra and Soma,” followed by imper  
atives addressed to those gods. The sixth verse starts the same, with the vocative,  but continues somewhat differently: rather than ordering the gods to unleash their  powers in yet another way, the poet expresses the hope that his own thought (and  its verbal expression) will envelop the gods like horse-tackle. This prayer-offering and the sacred formulations (bráhman) that Indra and Soma are urged to quicken  in pāda d brings the brutal first section to a more benign and R̥gvedic conclusion. Verse 7 is also addressed to Indra and Soma, also in the vocative, but with the  vocative postponed till the beginning of the second half of the verse. This slight  change in structure allows this verse to serve as a transition to the next subsection,  which continues, in our opinion, through verse 11 and is defined by a ring provided  by the preverb práti “against, in response to,” opening 7a and 11c. Though the  demands for action continue in this section, they take a more personal turn. In the  first section, the gods were simply ordered to destroy evildoers; in this section the  target is evildoers who act against us (as the práti signals). These verses all posit an  innocent victim (usually 1st person) of the malefactor who is to be destroyed by the  gods. Moreover, the avengers are no longer just Indra and Soma in tandem; each  verse has a different designated hitter: just Indra in 8, Soma in 9, Agni in 10, and  the gods in general in 11. The nature of the offenses has also become more sharply  defined, in that the transgressions involve evil or false speech (even the “cheat” of  vss. 10–11 means literally “desire to deceive”). Although evil speech and hostility to  sacred speech were already found in verse 2, these linguistic offenses were only some  of the condemned activities in the first section; they are the only ones here. In the two next verses (12–13), speech, true and false, is foregrounded, and the  punishment of the speaker of falsehood is reassuringly affirmed. But the mood  changes abruptly in verse 14: the speaker seems to stand accused of the very offenses  he called upon the gods to punish; the innocent 1st persons of verses 7–11 are the  objects of Agni’s anger. The aborted conditional clause of 14ab seems to convey the  speaker’s distress. In verses 15–16 the speaker swears a dramatic oath concerning  the truth of his denial and calls down further destruction on the man who falsely  accused him. The accusation is that he is a yātu(dhā́na), a “sorcerer.” The speaker’s  ringing assertion of his innocence and his powerful curse against his accuser brings  this section of the hymn to a resounding conclusion.  
Indeed, we are of the opinion that the rest of the hymn was simply tacked onto  what precedes because it concerns sorcerers, using the same word yātu, and simi lar demonic beings. The tone of the remainder (vss. 17–25) is very different, with  the theme of true and false speech recessive. The enemies are sorcerers in various  animal forms, and the sense of personal menace and of human evildoing is almost  entirely absent. Nonetheless, even if we are correct that these nine verses were origi nally independent, the fact that the full hymn was transmitted independently in the  R̥gveda and both recensions of the Atharvaveda would indicate that the join was  made early.  
The Indian tradition (and many Western commentators, including Geldner)  reads Vasiṣṭha’s biography into the dramatic middle of the hymn, interpreting  the accusation and denial in verses 15–16 as evidence for the hostility between  Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra found in much later texts. In this interpretation Viśvāmitra  is the accuser, and Vasiṣṭha the outraged 1st-person speaker. Needless to say,  there is absolutely no evidence for this in the hymn itself, and no evidence for the  

Vasiṣṭha–Viśvāmitra feud elsewhere in the R̥gveda. It is always necessary to be wary  about “reading backward” into the R̥gveda and other Vedic texts.
