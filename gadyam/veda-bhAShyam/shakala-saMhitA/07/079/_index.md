79 (595)  
Dawn  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
This little hymn is dense with phonetic figures and puns, and like the preceding  hymn has signature words—in this case the preverb ví “apart, widely” and the pho nologically similar verbal roots vas “dawn” and vR̥(var) “(un)cover.”  
Like many Dawn hymns, this one gives the opening of the Vala cave and the  release of the cows imprisoned therein as the mythic model for each new dawn (see  esp. vs. 4). Dawn’s association with the distribution of goods is also emphasized in  the last three verses.

Dawn As noted in the published introduction, ví is the signature word of this hymn. The first and last hemistichs of the hymn (1a, 5c) begin with ví and a form (indeed two, in the etymological figure in 1a) of √vas: 1a vy uṣā̀āvaḥ and 5c vyuchántī, forming a ring, and ví opens 1d, 2a, 3c, 4d as well. This preverb also gets played with in various ways: 2b opens with víśo ‘clans’, whose 1st syllable falsely promises the preverb. The regular oppositional counterpart of ví, namely sám, opens 2c and provides the 2nd syllable of 1c (susaṃdṛ́gbhiḥ). The alliteration of 3c is also set in motion by its opening ví (see below).
