Aśvins  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
In its final verse this hymn repeats the last verse of the previous hymn, and as that  verse says, it too is an intricate one (suvr̥ktí). The first verse marks this as an early morning hymn. Since the ruddy light of early dawn is elsewhere associated with the  ruddy cattle, the poet echoes that connection by describing the horses and cattle  that the Aśvins bring. There is also a second possible reading: the two compounds  áśvāmaghā[ḥ] gómaghā[ḥ] “having bounties of horses, bounties of cattle” could  be nominative plurals as well as duals and be taken as proleptic adjectives modify ing the 1st-person “we.” This grammatical ambiguity can imply that the horses and  
cattle that the Aśvins bring will become the horses and cattle that we will have. In verses 1–2 the Aśvins are asked also for rescue from enemies, want, and dis ease. In verses 3–4 the poet then turns especially to the chariot of the Aśvins, and, as  often, the chariot is linked to the sacrifice itself. In 3c its horses are “in the harness of  truth,” that is, joined to the hymns and even to the rites, which may also be expres sions of truth. The chariot is also syū́magabhasti, an elusive hapax. Geldner among  others connects gábhasti “hands” to the rays of the sun, but there is no clear instance  of such a use elsewhere in the R̥gveda. We propose, therefore, that the hands, which  normally hold reins, have themselves become the reins (syū́man) of the chariot  because they are the hands of the priests, who control the ritual. In verse 4 the analy sis and reference of viśvápsnya, perhaps “containing all milk,” are obscure. Geldner  wonders whether the word might describe the praise hymn or Agni. The gharma  vessel suggested here is uncertain at best. Verse 5 then returns to the Aśvins’ ability  to save from danger by describing four great acts of rescue. The last, the rescue of  Jāhuṣa, is the least familiar and can be only tentatively reconstructed. The best sug gestion is that of Oldenberg, who says that by combining verse 5d and I.116.20cd we  can get the following: Jāhuṣa was trapped by his enemies is a wild, rocky area, but  the Aśvins brought him out and set him down on light, soft soil.
