All Gods  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Although this hymn is technically dedicated to the All Gods, it is only the R̥bhus  and Indra who feature in the hymn proper (R̥bhus esp. vss. 1–2, Indra vss. 3–7), with  Savitar addressed in the final verse (8). The association of Indra with the R̥bhus  identifies the ritual moment as the Third Pressing, which they share, and since  Savitar is often associated with the evening, his presence is also appropriate.  
The first four verses concern the sacrifice: the gods come, drink together, and  give gifts to the sacrificer and his patrons. In verse 4 Indra is sent home with a final  chorus. The next verses change the scene. In verses 5–6 Indra is praised for his help  in winning more territory for us, but he seems to be withholding the wealth we  expect. The most puzzling verse is 7, which has elicited various interpretations. In  our opinion, the “triple kin-bonds” refers to the three-generation model, in which a  man is situated conceptually between his father and his sons; this man is threatened  by dissolution and premature death, not only of himself but also of his sons, and he  approaches Indra for aid, since Indra himself successfully attains old age (an inter esting conceit for a “deathless” or “immortal” god). But this interpretation remains  uncertain and speculative. The first pāda of the final verse (8) forms a ring with the  first pāda of the hymn, and the topic returns to the gifts we expect and hope for.
