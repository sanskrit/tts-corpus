Ādityas  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
3 verses: triṣṭubh  
This short and probably late hymn has a number of unusual features. In verse 1 the  poet describes himself and his fellow sacrificers as áditi “offenseless,” and because  they are áditi they are also ādityá “Ādityas” or “sons of Aditi.” This is a surpris ing claim, and Geldner understandably softens it by turning the metaphor into a  simile. According to him, the poet asks that he and his people be offenseless like Ādityas. Were we to adopt Geldner’s approach, then in 1b we could supply a differ ent verb form and translate “there should be for us a fortress” (so Geldner) or “you  [=Ādityas] should be for us a fortress.” This solution is attractive since gods are  called fortresses in, for example, I.189.2 and VII.95.1. But there is no signal in the  text for the simile or for the ellipsis, and therefore, albeit with considerable hesita tion, we have translated the verse as if the speakers embody the “offenseless” gods.  That theme of offenselessness is continued in the next verse, in which the poet begs  that he and the sacrificers not be held responsible for the evil actions done by others.  
In the last verse the poet speaks of the presence of the Aṅgirases in this sacrifice,  which suggests that the present priests now embody the legendary Aṅgiras priests,  a claim implicitly made elsewhere as well. The appeal to Savitar, who is associated  with the evening, and in verse 3d the reference to the All Gods, who in the later rite  receive offerings at the Third Pressing, place this hymn in that soma-pressing. The  identity of the “father” (vs. 3c) remains mysterious. Sāyaṇa identifies him as Varuṇa  since Varuṇa and Mitra are the fathers of Vasiṣṭha (cf. VII.33.11–13), but there is  little basis for associating Varuṇa here with either the Aṅgirases or the All Gods.
