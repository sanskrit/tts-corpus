Dawn  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is characterized by two “signature words”: práti “in response to / oppo site” (found in every verse but 4)  and the present participle vibhā́tī “radiating  widely” (vss. 3–5), words regularly found in other Dawn hymns. In fact, there is,  until near the end, little novel about this hymn. The most noticeable feature until  the end is that the middle verse (3) refers to the dawns in the plural, though they  
seem to be immediately present, while the other verses have singular Dawn. But the most noteworthy aspect of the hymn is the striking hapax verb that opens  the last half verse (5c): tilvilāyádhvam. This is a transparent denominative built to  the adjective tílvila (V.62.7), but this only displaces the problem, as the meaning  and derivation of this adjective are not at all clear, and its rhyming reduplicative formation (til-vil) deviates markedly from normal Vedic word formation patterns.  The adjective is generally taken to mean “fruitful’ or the like and may be connected  with the word tilá “sesame.” If so, the creation and abundant scattering of seed may  be the intended meaning here, though this is only a guess. The English idiom used  to translate this obscure word is meant to convey its special status in the diction of  this otherwise unremarkable hymn.

Dawn On the lexical marks of this hymn, see published introduction. The signature word práti opens the hymn and is repeated at the beginning of the first two pādas of vs. 2 and in the middle of 3a; it returns at the beginning of the last vs. (5), thus sketching a ring.

The other signature word, fem. pres. part. vibhātī́- ‘radiating widely’ is concentrated in the latter part of the hymn, ending the pādas 3b, 4b, and 5c.
