76 (592)  
Dawn  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
A tightly structured hymn: the verbally responsive verses 3–4 are set within an inner  ring (vss. 2, 5) with exact repetition in their final pādas (ámardhanto vásubhiḥ...). This  

structure is reinforced by tense usage: the verbs in verses 1–2 are all augmented aor ists referring to the immediate past of today’s dawn; those in verses 5–7 are present  indicatives and imperatives, stating general truths about the behavior of the dawns  and the singers; while those in verses 3–4 are augmented imperfects (with one per  
fect) referring to the distant past, which gave rise to the present situation. This structure defines verses 3–4 as an omphalos, and indeed these verses show  clear omphalos features. Verse 3 contains the most intricate syntax in the hymn,  while verse 4 concerns the Father’s finding of “the hidden light” in the Vala cave,  the primeval model for each new dawn. Verses 3 and 4 are in reverse chronologi cal order: the Fathers find the hidden light of Dawn in verse 4, and verse 3 then  describes the subsequent time with the periodic return of the Dawn, eagerly pro ceeding to the sacrifice as if to a lover, not moving slowly and reluctantly like a  maiden leaving an assignation.  
The exact repetition in the inner ring mentioned above is not a static feature. It  participates in what we have termed “poetic repair” (Jamison 2006) and therefore  provides forward movement by setting up a puzzle that is resolved later in the hymn.  The adjective ámardhantaḥ “not negligent” modifies “paths” in verse 2. The com  
bination seems discordant, although the hearer can construct a meaningful read ing: paths that are not negligent are those, properly maintained and “set in order,”  that lead one where they are supposed to go. The application of “not negligent” to  the priests in verse 5 is far easier to interpret: not negligent priests are those who  properly perform the sacrifice every morning and therefore do not transgress the  gods’ commandments that regulate the proper functioning of the cosmos, since  by ritual logic the sacrifice causes the new day to dawn. The phrase in verse 5 thus  “repairs” the more jarring one in verse 2, but the jarring phrase in verse 2 also  forced the hearers to formulate a more complex conception.  
As so often, consideration of poetic structure gives depth to the apparently  conventional expressions and images in this hymn, which recur in so many other  descriptions of Dawn.
