Mitra and Varuṇa  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
Like the preceding hymn, with which it shares its final verse, this hymn begins with  a description of the rising Sun, who here is the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa, watch ing over the good and evils deeds of humans. In verse 2 the rising Sun parallels  the voice of the poet, who raises his hymn to Mitra and Varuṇa. And just as the  Sun fills the worlds with light, Mitra and Varuṇa penetrate all the worlds and even  go beyond them. Like kings who send their agents into the communities to note  what their subjects are doing and saying, Mitra and Varuṇa also have spies who are  everywhere (vs. 3).  
The mention of these spies in verse 3 may help explain the most problematic  verse in the hymn, verse 5. There are several ways to construe the verse: ámūrā víśvā could be vocative and nominative dual respectively, describing Mitra and  Varuṇa as those who can never be fooled (so Geldner), but more likely they  describe the drúhaḥ “deceptions” in 5c. As Oldenberg notes, grammatically dis persing the phrase ámūrā víśvā(ḥ). . . imā́ḥ “all these who are never fooled” seems  forced. But the idea that Mitra and Varuṇa themselves deceive has understand ably given interpreters pause. Still, in X.109.4 Indra is said never to be deceived  but himself deceiving (√dabh) and in the previous hymn, in VII.60.9c, Aryaman  can bring “hostilities” against those who do not act rightly. The “deceptions”  of Mitra and Varuṇa are probably their hidden spies. These spies are actually  not seen and accordingly in this verse they are unidentified and hence verbally  hidden. The verse even works a deception of its own, describing the spies in the  feminine plural—spáśaḥ “spies” is masculine plural—and delaying the feminine  term that stands for them, drúhaḥ, until pāda c.
