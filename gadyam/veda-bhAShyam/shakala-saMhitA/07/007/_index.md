Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The poet invokes the powerful Agni—the god who acts with strength (sahasānám) in  the first verse and is summoned as the “son of strength” (sūno sahasaḥ) in the last.  Within this recursive frame the poet follows the descent of Agni from the heaven onto  the earth. In 1d Agni runs at “a measured pace” and is found “among the gods in his  own person,” that is, in the form of the burning sun. He is then invited to journey to  earth (vs. 2) and to the sacrificial place as a participant in the rite (vs. 3). Still, Agni  remains simultaneously earthly and heavenly. His “two mothers” or “mother and  father” in 3c are Earth and Heaven, but they can also be the two fire-churning sticks,  the aráṇī̆. In verse 4 Agni’s birth is set squarely on earth and at the sacrifice, where he  assumes his role as chief priest of the rite (vss. 4–5). Verse 6 presents an interesting  problem since it is not clear who is spoken about. In our view the subject is most likely  the gods, to whom the poet now returns at the end of the hymn, thus balancing the  reference to them in verses 1–2. But pādas a and cd can also describe the patrons of  the sacrifice and b can parenthetically refer to the priests, as Geldner suggests. This  ambiguity is likely intentional, allowing a double reference to gods and humans.
