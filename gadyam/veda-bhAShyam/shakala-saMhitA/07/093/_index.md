Indra and Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first six verses of this hymn, though they contain numerous examples of dual  address of and reference to Indra and Agni together, are strongly skewed toward  Indra. The two gods are called “smiters of Vr̥tra” (vss. 1, 4) and “possessors of  good maces” (Indra’s weapon; vs. 4); they “smite” (Indra’s activity) the enemy (vs.  5) and “drive” to the sacrifice (vs. 6; since Agni is kindled on the ritual ground, he  has no need to drive to it). Moreover the theme is the winning of prizes (vā́ja) and  their distribution, and the besting of opponents: this agonistic cast is more typical  of Indra than of Agni. The last two verses (7–8) are addressed to Agni only, in his  familiar ritual role, mediating between the sacrificer and the gods, including Indra.  But even in these verses Agni’s own character is overlaid with that of other gods: for  instance, in verse 7 he seems to be assimilated to Varuṇa and the other Ādityas in  forgiving offenses.

Indra and Agni Both Geldner and Renou remark on the prominence of the word vā́ja- in the hymn (“Das Schlagwort ist vā́ja”; “Thème du vā́ja”). Although I would certainly not deny that, the word does not seem to call attention to its dominance in the way that other signature words often do: not only is it absent from three of the eight vss. (4, 5, 7), but especially at the beginning (vss. 1-3) it is not prominently positioned (not at a pāda boundary or after the caesura) nor positioned in the same place in the vs. line -- both being ways in which a word can assert itself -- nor does it repeat the same case and number. In vss. 6 and 8 it is hemistich-final (6d, 8b) and so becomes slightly more salient. In other words, it’s certainly a theme, but a somewhat muted one.
