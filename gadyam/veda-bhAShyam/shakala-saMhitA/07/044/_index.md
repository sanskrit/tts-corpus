Dadhikrā, except Assorted Divinities (1)  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1  
Like VII.41, this hymn begins with a verse in jagatī calling on a number of gods,  especially those associated with the dawn ritual, and including the figure that will be the subject of most of the rest of the hymn, in this case the celebrated  racehorse Dadhikrā(van). (See IV.38–40 for other hymns devoted to Dadhikrā;  the last two [39—40] also show significant dawn associations.) Unlike VII.41,  however, where the god who is subject of the rest of the hymn, Bhaga, holds  the stage essentially alone after the first verse, Dadhikrā shares each of the  subsequent verses with a number of gods, again primarily characteristic of the  dawn ritual.  
The most difficult verse is 3, not coincidentally the middle verse, whose third  pāda contains two color terms as addressees and a next-to-impossible hapax  (mām̐ścatóḥ), whose meaning is hotly disputed. Most commentators interpret  the color terms as referring to other horses. Our interpretation is quite different  and unavoidably speculative, but rather than introducing two otherwise unknown  horses, we identify the two addressees as gods associated with the ritual. In our view  the hapax refers to the two twilights (literally, “the time of the hiding of the moon,”  originally applied just to dawn), and the copper-colored one is the sun, whose color  is reddish at rising and setting, while the reddish-brown one is soma: the same color  term is used of soma a number of times.  
Though it is not entirely clear why Dadhikrā is so strongly associated with the  dawn, it may be significant that the priestly gifts (dakṣiṇā) are distributed at the  dawn ritual and horses are among the most prized of these gifts. In most of this  hymn the equine aspects of Dadhikrā are not emphasized, except for vs. 4, unlike  the Dadhikrā hymns in Maṇḍala IV.

Dadhikrā Both by number of vss. and by its listing style, this hymn fits the sequence of All Gods hymns in which it is found, though the presence of Dadhikrā among these deities is somewhat puzzling. As noted in the published introduction, most of the divinities named have associations with the Dawn ritual.
