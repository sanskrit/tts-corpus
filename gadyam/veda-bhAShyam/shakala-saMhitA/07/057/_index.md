Maruts  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
Ritual offering to the Maruts is the subject of this whole hymn, although, unlike  the preceding hymn, no specific ritual is referred to. The hymn begins with an invita tion offered to the Maruts to the sacrificial “honey” (soma), an invitation phrased  in a way very close to the English idiom indicating potential possession “has their  name on it” (at least in our interpretation). They travel to the sacrifice and, having  received the guest reception, are asked to sit on the ritual grass, to receive the obla tion (vs. 2). The sacrifice is successfully concluded in verse 5, and their help and gifts  requested. The last two verses (6–7) seem to be a summary of the ritual process—in  6 they are urged to come in pursuit of oblations, in 7 to come in order to give help  
in return—the two verses being unified by the opening “when praised.” Verse 4 is somewhat odd in a Marut context. Although it is common to beg the  Maruts to keep their missile away from us (see, e.g., the preceding hymn, VII.56.9),  the reference to an “offense” committed by us humans is more appropriate to a  Varuṇa or Āditya context: see especially the use of the term in the Vasiṣṭha-Varuṇa  hymns later in this maṇḍala (VII.86.4, 87.7, 88.6), since the Maruts are not usually  associated with moral issues (though see vs. 5 in the next hymn, VII.58). Much  more typical is the lovely description of the glittering Maruts in verse 3.
