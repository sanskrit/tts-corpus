All Gods (except Ahi 16, Ahi Budhnya 17a)  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
25 verses: dvipadā 1–21, triṣṭubh 22–25  
This loosely structured hymn intersperses verses relating to the sacrifice, especially  its poetic portion (e.g., vss. 1, 4–5, 8–9), with verses dedicated to particular gods.  

In the early parts of the hymn, the verses to gods are structured as riddles, and the  god is not named: Indra in verse 3, Savitar in verse 4, Agni (?) in verse 7. But in later  parts of the hymn the gods and divine forces are identified, starting with Varuṇa  in verses 10–11. Minor gods predominate in this section (e.g., Ahi Budhnya, the  Serpent of the Deep, vss. 16–17), through verse 23. There are also several interludes  requesting help against hostility and bodily harm (vss. 12–13, 18–19). The final  two verses call on many of the major gods of the pantheon, without distinguishing  characteristics.  
There is a distinct watery theme running throughout the hymn, beginning with  the waters themselves (vss. 2–3). When Varuṇa is mentioned (vss. 10–11), it is in his  association with waters, a mostly later quality of Varuṇa’s. The Child of the Waters  (Apām Napāt, vs. 15) and the “water-born” Serpent of the Deep (vss. 16–17) con  
tribute to this aqueous environment, and the waters themselves reappear in verse  23. The reason for this emphasis on water is not clear.

All Gods Renou characterizes this hymn as “invitation without praise.” The first 21 (or actually 20 and a half) vss. of this 25-vs. hymn are in Dvipadā meter. Despite its name, this meter should be considered to consist of four pādas of 5 syllables each, since verbs located in the 6th syllable of a putative 10-syl. pāda are generally accented (see 3b, d, 4b, 6b, 20d); however, consider 14d, 17d, where verbs in that position are unaccented. Those two violations fall in the latter part of the Dvipadā portion and may be beginning the transition to Triṣṭubh, which takes over in the 2nd half of vs. 21. On the meter see Oldenberg, Prol. 95-98.
