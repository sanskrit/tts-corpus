Vasisṭha’s Sons (1–9); Vasis ̣ ṭha (10–14) ̣  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (1–9), Vasiṣṭha’s sons (10–14)  
14 verses: triṣṭubh  
This famous hymn, coming at the very end of the Vasiṣṭha Indra cycle, treats the  mystical birth of Vasiṣṭha and the accomplishments of Vasiṣṭha and his descen dants, particularly the feat of attracting Indra to the side of King Sudās and ensur ing Indra’s support in the Battle of the Ten Kings, the battle treated at length  in VII.18. The Anukramaṇī identifies the poet of verses 1–9 as Vasiṣṭha and the  “deity” as Vasiṣṭha’s sons, with the opposite identifications for verses 10–14, but this  does not seem the most perspicuous assignment of roles. Rather, it seems that the  hymn falls into three parts: 1–6, 7–9, 10–14, starting with a time close to the (semi mythical) present and moving backward to the deep mythical past.  
The first six verses celebrate the Vasiṣṭhas’ successful invitation of Indra to their  soma sacrifice and Indra’s subsequent aid to Sudās and the Tr̥tsus in the Ten Kings  battle. Indra himself appears to be the speaker in verses 1 and 4. The first two verses  depict one of the themes running through this set of Indra hymns: competing sacri  
fices. Here, Indra seems actually to rise from his seat at another sacrifice to go to the  Vasiṣṭhas in verse 1, with his journey described in verse 2. Verses 3–6 treat his aid to  Sudās in the Ten Kings battle, with all credit given to the Vasiṣṭhas’ poetic skill for  bringing this aid (vss. 3–5), and Indra himself declaring this in verse 4.  
The next section begins with a trio of riddles based on the number three (vs.  7), with the last pāda of that verse asserting that it is exactly this knowledge that  the Vasiṣṭhas control—a nice meta-comment on what Vedic poets were supposed  to know. There is no consensus (modern or ancient) on the answers to these three  riddles. The three producers of semen may be the three soma-pressings, or heaven  (with its rain), soma, and man—and other answers have also been suggested. The  three Ārya “creatures” with light in front could be the three ritual fires, or the fire,  the sun, and dawn—and, again, there are other possible solutions. As for the three  “heats,” these could again be the ritual fires, or the sun, the fire, and the gharma924 VII.33  
drink, or some other triad. It is perhaps pleasing that the Vasiṣṭhas’ esoteric knowl edge has remained safe with them for over three millennia! This skill of theirs at  decoding secrets and putting them in proper verbal form is celebrated further in  verse 8 and the first half of verse 9.  
The second half of verse 9 provides the transition to the last section, concern ing the birth of Vasiṣṭha. What the Vasiṣṭhas are weaving (a motif recurring almost  verbatim in vs. 12) is not entirely clear, but we are inclined to think it concerns the  institution and performance of the sacrifice. It is clear why they are approaching the  Apsarases (the heavenly “nymphs” of Vedic and later Indian culture): one of the  Apsarases’ number, Urvaśī, is their mother (see vss. 11–12), with Mitra and Varuṇa  as their father (see vss. 11, 13), in the first of their forefather Vasiṣṭha’s births. Both  births are referred to in verse 10, both that from Mitra and Varuṇa and that when  Agastya presented him to the clan. To say that the details of the births are murky  is an understatement, and we will not attempt here to interpret all the mysteries in  these verses. The last verse (14) is traditionally taken as Agastya’s words, introduc  
ing Vasiṣṭha to his adoptive clan, the Tr̥tsus, and outlining Vasiṣṭha’s ritual role.  The address to “you thrusters forth” (pratr̥daḥ) is most likely a pun on their name.

Vasiṣṭha and the Vasiṣṭhids On the structure and thematics of this famous hymn see the published introduction, as well as the introductory remarks of both Oldenberg and Geldner With VII.18, the account of the Battle of the Ten Kings, it bookends the Indra hymns of VII and contributes its own background to the (fragmentary) narrative of King Sudās and the Ten Kings Battle.

The name vásiṣṭha- appears in every vs. of this hymn, primarily at the end of the d pāda: vss. 1, 2, 3, 4, (not 5, 6, though vásiṣṭha- appears in both c pādas,) 7, (not 8, though it's in middle of d,) 9, (not 10 though in c, nor 11 though in a,) 12, 13, 14.
