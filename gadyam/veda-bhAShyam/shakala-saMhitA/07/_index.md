### Sages  
Maṇḍala VII is unusual because in this, the longest of the Family Books, almost all  the hymns are attributed to just one poet, Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi, Vasiṣṭha the son  of Mitra and Varuṇa. According to the Anukramaṇī two hymns were composed  either by Vasiṣṭha or by Kumāra Āgneya (101, 102), and two hymns were joint compositions of Vasiṣṭha and his sons (32, 33). In 32, however, it assigns one pāda, or  at most one and a half verses, to Śakti Vāsiṣṭha, and the rest of the hymn is by his  father. The Anukramaṇī unequivocally attributes all the other one hundred hymns  of the maṇḍala to Vasiṣṭha alone.  

This attribution of all these hymns to a single poet is historically unlikely. Perhaps  many of the poems were composed by Vasiṣṭha, but unlike the other family poets,  the Vasiṣṭha poets apparently developed a tradition of crediting their work to their  illustrious ancestor. Because of this focus on him, Vasiṣṭha emerges as a distinct  literary figure in the maṇḍala. He is mentioned—or mentions himself—twenty-four  times in VII, and he appears as a model ritualist also in hymns from later maṇḍalas,  for example, X.150.5, X.181.1, both attributed to his descendants, and X.65.15.  Not only is he a distinct figure in the R̥gveda, he also has a distinct literary personality. For the construction of a poetic persona, see Jamison (2007: esp. chap. 1, and  the following chapters) for a discussion of Vasiṣṭha.  

### Gods  
Maṇḍala VII also has a distinctive distribution of hymns. It includes nine  hymns dedicated, either wholly or in part, to the Ādityas or to Mitra and  Varuṇa, four hymns to Indra and Varuṇa, and four hymns to Varuṇa alone. The  significant role that the Ādityas and particularly Varuṇa play in VII perhaps  reflects a family connection to these gods, which also figures in the tradition  that Vasiṣṭha was the son of Mitra and Varuṇa. 

The personality of Vasiṣṭha is  defined most strongly in the four hymns to Varuṇa (VII.86–89). They describe  an intimate relationship between the poet and the god, in which the poet fears  the god’s displeasure but hopes for his mercy and his guidance, while recalling  their previous friendship.  

The maṇḍala also contains the R̥gveda’s longest continuous series of hymns to  the Aśvins (67–74) and to Dawn (75–81), although the hymns of neither collec tion show the originality of the Varuṇa hymns. There are a number of noteworthy  individual hymns. 

### Battle of the Ten Kings  
Among the most significant is VII.18, depicting the so-called Battle of the Ten Kings, which may reflect actual events, although with what accuracy it is hard to say. In distinctly triumphalist language, it tells how King Sudās  and the Bharatas were victorious over an alliance of ten kings ranged against him.  This battle may have been historically important if it marked the dominance of  the Bharatas over other Vedic tribes and significant movement toward a political  consolidation of the Vedic peoples. Closely connected with VII.18 is VII.33, attributed partly to Vasiṣṭha himself and partly to his sons. 

The hymn affirms the role of  Vasiṣṭha in securing Indra’s critical help in Sudās’s victory over the ten kings and  concludes with his sons’ story of the birth of Vasiṣṭha. 

### Frog hymn  
Another quite remarkable  hymn, although in a very different vein, is VII.103, the Frog Hymn, in which the  poet compares the action and croaking of frogs to the ritual acts and recitations  of priests. The hymn was likely composed for the beginning of the rainy season  and with the purpose of spurring the fertility appropriate to the season. Equally  unusual and delightful is the sleep charm (VII.55).  

### Signature  
The Vasiṣṭha clan refrain, “Do you protect us always with your blessings,” occupies the final pāda of most of the triṣṭubh hymns in this maṇḍala.
