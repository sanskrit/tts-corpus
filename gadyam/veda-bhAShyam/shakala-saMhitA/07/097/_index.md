Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
According to the Anukramaṇī (whose identifications are reproduced here in the  heading) there is a wide array of divine dedicands for the individual verses of this  hymn: Indra alone, Br̥haspati alone, Indra and Br̥haspati, and Indra and the more  transparently named Brahmaṇaspati (“Lord of the Sacred Formulation”). The  hymn is more carefully structured than the random listing would suggest, however.  
First, as has often been discussed above, Hanns-Peter Schmidt (1968) has shown  that Br̥haspati was originally an epithet of Indra in his priestly role and only gradu ally split off into a separate god. As in IV.50 this divine history is recapitulated in  part in the progress of this hymn, though in a different way from the earlier hymn.  For most of the hymn only one of the divine figures is on stage at a time: verse  1 has Indra, verse 2 Br̥haspati, and Br̥haspati holds sway in verses 4–8. Even in  verse 3, supposedly dedicated to both Indra and Brahmaṇaspati, the two are not  depicted together, and in fact the phraseology seems designed to identify Indra as  Brahmaṇaspati: the two-word phrase bráhmaṇas pátim “lord of the sacred formula  
tion” in pāda b is, it seems, paraphrased with the defining relative clause of d, refer ring to Indra: yó bráhmaṇaḥ ...rā́jā “who is king of the sacred formulation,” with  “king” substituting for “lord,” thus superimposing the one on the other. What we  are claiming here, then, is that in verses 1–8 the divine names Indra and Br̥haspati/ Brahmaṇaspati refer to a single divine figure, Indra.  
But when the transparent designation Brahmaṇaspati recurs in verse 9, it is  immediately preceded by the dual pronoun vām “you two”; there must therefore  now be two divine addressees, and the split between Indra and his epithet has been  effected. The last two verses (9–10) call upon them both, using dual verbs, pro  
nouns, and vocatives quite insistently. It is because we consider bráhmaṇas páti- an  epithet in verse 3 and a divine name in verse 9 that we have translated them differ ently in the two verses. Notice also that Brahmaṇaspati, as opposed to Br̥haspati, is  
only found in verses also containing the noun bráhman “sacred formulation.” But the hymn has another divine presence, not named but clearly there, who  complicates the identity problem even more. The entire hymn is set on the ritual  ground; this scene is set at the very beginning, in verse 1, starting with the word  yajñé “at the sacrifice” and continuing with a clear depiction of the locus of ritual  offerings, where men and gods (including Indra) meet. But, in the middle verses  mentioning only Br̥haspati (4–8), that god is described in ways extremely suggestive  of Agni, the ritual fire: he sits on the womb (vs. 4); he is both bright and roaring (vs.  5), bright, golden, and good to enter (vs. 7), and most clearly, in the image of verse  6 he is dark below but possessed of horses like ruddy clouds. All of this phraseol ogy has clear counterparts in descriptions of Agni. Thus, the divine figure Indra/  

Br̥haspati is identified here in this ritual context with the ultimate ritually oriented  god, Agni. This identification is found elsewhere; see especially V.43.12. It is noteworthy, but not surprising, that the usual mythological association of  Indra/Br̥haspati with the Vala cave is entirely absent.

Indra and Bṛhaspati Renou treats this hymn in EVP XV.66-69. For the structure of the hymn and the covert identification of Bṛhaspati (/Indra) with Agni, see published introduction. This identification is argued for extensively by Schmidt (Bṛhaspati und Indra, 62-67, which also contains a complete tr. and philological comm.).
