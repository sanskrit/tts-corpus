Varuṇa  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn and the following three hymns (VII.87–89) are justly famous because  they have an unusually intimate tone and because the poet Vasiṣṭha as a literary  creation of the poem emerges as a distinct personality. Jamison (2007:  91–118)  offers a detailed study of the hymns in this group and of the creation of the poet’s  personality. Like the other hymns in this small collection, this poem centers on just  two figures, the poet—Vasiṣṭha according to tradition—and the god Varuṇa, and  Vasiṣṭha speaks personally, even confessionally with Varuṇa. Apparently Vasiṣṭha  has been suffering from some kind of affliction, which, he has been told, is the pun ishment of King Varuṇa for an offense. He begs Varuṇa to accept his offerings and  repentance, to forgive his transgressions, which he says were not intentional (vs. 6),  and to restore him to prosperity and health.  
The relationship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa constantly shifts as the hymn  unfolds. The literary strategy of the poem most clearly appears in its use of pro nouns and other markers of person, as Jamison (2007: 96–100) shows in her analysis.  Use of the 3rd person distances the speaker and the object, while addressing another  as “you” is a token of closeness and presence to one another. The poet deploys these  pronouns first to distance Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, then to bring them close, and finally  to separate them once again. So in verse 1 Vasiṣṭha is absent because there is no  reference to the speaker, and Varuṇa is distanced by the 3rd singular pronoun asya.  His absence is mitigated only by fact that unaccented asya should be anaphoric and  therefore might point to the previous presence of the god. Otherwise, the relation  
ship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa is completely broken. In verse 2 Vasiṣṭha is present  (1st sg. in each of the four lines), and Varuṇa remains distanced. In verse 3 Vasiṣṭha  is present once again (1st sg.) and Varuṇa is partly present: he is addressed in the  vocative but he is also mentioned in the 3rd person. In verse 4 both Vasiṣṭha (1st sg.)  and Varuṇa (2nd sg.) are present. Then there begins a retreat from their full presence  to one another. In verse 5 Vasiṣṭha is less present (the 1st pl. generalizes rather than  personalizes the speaker) and Varuṇa is present (through the vocative address and  2nd sg. imperative). This verse reverses 3, in which Vasiṣṭha was fully present but  Varuṇa partly present. In verse 6 Vasiṣṭha is distanced (note especially svá “one’s  own,” not “my own”), and Varuṇa is present (through the vocative address). Again this verse reverses 2, in which Vasiṣṭha was present and Varuṇa was distanced. In  verse 7 Vasiṣṭha is present (1st sg.), but Varuṇa is distanced (3rd sg.). This partially  reverses 1 insofar as Vasiṣṭha was absent there but is present here. Varuṇa remains  distanced in both verses 1 and 7. The last verse (8), is a concluding, extra-hymnic  verse, a coda that stands outside the main structure of the hymn.  
This analysis also shows the omphalos structure of the hymn. Verse 1 corresponds  to 7, verse 2 to 6, verse 3 to 5, and verse 4 is the center. It is the thematic heart of the  hymn because it is in this verse that the poet and the god are both present and pres ent to one another. It also signifies the determination of Vasiṣṭha, who anticipates  the resolution of his conflict with Varuṇa. Varuṇa will—perhaps even in the sense of  “must”—proclaim what Vasiṣṭha has done, and Vasiṣṭha promises to make amends  to the god to receive the god’s forgiveness. Although the hymn moves away from this  encounter between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, the last verse suggests that the problem has  been resolved. Varuṇa has returned to the distance, but he and Vasiṣṭha now mutually  support one another. Varuṇa has enlightened Vasiṣṭha (vs. 7c), and Vasiṣṭha ritually  serves the god to his greater “wealth,” his power and glory (7d).  
In verse 2b the meaning of váruṇe “within Varuṇa” may play on the possible ety mological relation of váruṇa and vratá “commandment.” That is, “within Varuṇa”  has the sense of “under, or in conformity with, the commandment of Varuṇa.”  The poet wants to be no longer at odds with Varuṇa. At the same time the hope  for closeness to the god or even for envelopment by the god, which is suggested in  the phrase, looks forward to the increasing intimacy of Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa. The  state is both parallel to and contrasts with the situation in verse 6c where the elder  is “within the misdeed of the younger.”  
In verse 4d, we read áva...īyām, from ava + √yā “make recompense,” instead of  the transmitted but metrically faulty áva...iyām.
