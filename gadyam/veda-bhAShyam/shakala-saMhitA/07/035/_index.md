All Gods  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
15 verses: triṣṭubh  
This fifteen-verse hymn is in competition for the most boring hymn in the R̥gveda  (a competition in which there are remarkably few entries). In the first thirteen  verses every pāda begins with the indeclinable word śám “luck, weal” in the  hardly varying formula “luck for us be X,” with X a god or gods, power, or  sacrificial element. There is generally a rationale for the groupings found in each  

verse, though it not always transparent (see, e.g., vs. 3). The final two verses  (14–15) inclusively beg all the gods in various groupings to enjoy the praise and  grant space to us.

All Gods As indicated in the published introduction, this hymn is remarkably monotonous and has no real content -- simply the unbroken repetition of the wish that various gods or natural elements “be luck” (śám) for us. It therefore needs and deserves very little comment. Besides the deities mentioned in each vs., what variety there is in the hymn is found in the adjuncts associated with each one, often a characterizing adjective (e.g., 1b) or an oblique case form expressing accompaniment (e.g., 1a) or circumstance (e.g., 1d). The 1st 13 vss. follow a fairly rigid template: # śáṃ (naḥ) GOD NAME (ADJUNCT) (“BE”) (with the latter expressed by a 3rd ps. impv. of √bhū or √as, or gapped; there seems no functional difference between √as and √bhū in this hymn). The order of adjunct and “be” can be flipped. Sometimes a single god (or god pair) occupies a pāda; sometimes two separate śám clauses are found in a pāda. In the former case, the adjuncts fill the extra space, while in the latter case the god/power name is all there is room for. In a few cases, noted below, the pattern is broken by the substitution of a verb other than ‘be’.
