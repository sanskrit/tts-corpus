Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
According to Geldner, this hymn expresses the wish for a son or for a replace ment for a lost son. This is a wish found already in VII.1, but it is even more  strongly articulated here. The best evidence for this interpretation is verses 7–8,  which describe the importance of a son of one’s own. Nonetheless, in our view,  the subject of this hymn is more likely Agni than a son, and its concern is with a  fire that has not come or is just coming to birth. The poet wants a fire of his own,  which will bring wealth to him and preserve his life. To be sure, the hymn does  contain an implicit analogy between Agni and a son, who likewise brings wealth  and preserves the family.  
One of the features of this hymn is the repetition of a word or of related words  in successive lines or verses: jagr̥bhré (3b) and gŕ̥bham (3c); uvóca (3c) and durókam (3d); agnír amŕ̥taḥ (4b), agnír amŕ̥tān (5b), and agnír amŕ̥tasya (6a); pári ṣadāma (6d)  and pariṣádyam (7a); and áraṇasya (7a) and áraṇaḥ (8a). Other repetitions occur at  a greater distance. Thus verse 8, the third from the last verse, has grábhāya (8a) and  ókaḥ (8c), echoing the repetitions within verse 3. This technique does not occur in  the first, introductory verse, nor in the last two verses, which are also VI.15.12 and  VII.3.10 respectively and which may have been borrowed from these hymns. These  verbal repetitions are a challenge to translate, particularly because in some cases the  poet uses the words in different senses. So, for example, amŕ̥ta refers to the “immor  
tal” gods in verse 5 but to “living” human beings in verse 6. In verse 6 pári √sad describes the sacrificers “sitting around” the fire, but in verse 7 it probably refers to  sequestering something or keeping it separate by drawing a notional circle around it.
