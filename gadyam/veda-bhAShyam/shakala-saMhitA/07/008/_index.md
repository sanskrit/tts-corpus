Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
Commenting on verse 4, Proferes (2007: 37) rightly says that this Agni, the fire of  the Bharatas, is linked to the military power of the tribe, and it is he, not the king  or the warriors, who is credited for the victory over the enemy tribe of the Pūrus.  There are hints of the extent of Agni’s power to repel the Pūrus in the repetition  of ví “afar” in verses 2, 3, and 4. Likewise, the poet describes how Agni, the son  of strength (vs. 7), becomes mighty (vs. 2) and makes his body strong (vs. 5). In an  interesting twist, Agni’s bodily strength, which is marked by his brightness, will  drive human bodily illness into darkness (vs. 6).
