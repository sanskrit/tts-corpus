Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The keywords in this hymn are ā́ “hither” and ihá “here.” The poet asks that Agni  come “hither” (vs. 1c) to sacrifice “here” (vss. 1d, 3c). And not only should Agni  come, but he should also bring the gods “hither” (vs. 5a) to enjoy the sacrifice  “here” (vs. 5b). The last pāda—excluding the Vasiṣṭha signature pāda—presents an  interesting twist, for the poet asks that this sacrifice, the sacrifice that is at this place  on earth, that is here where he has asked Agni to come and here where he is to bring  the gods, be placed “in heaven among the gods” (vs. 5c). At the end, therefore, what  is present and local should become celestial and divine.  
Verse 3 of this hymn presents an additional puzzle. What does it mean when  it says that good things become visible in Agni “three times at night”? Following  Sāyaṇa, Geldner argues that “night” here means the whole day, and therefore the  reference is to the three soma-pressings. Recognizing the difficulty of this interpre  
tation, Oldenberg wonders whether there might be a reference here to an Atirātra or  “overnight” rite. We agree and think that the reference here is to the rites that take  place at night. But what rites these are or why “good things” are visible in the fire  during them remains unclear.
