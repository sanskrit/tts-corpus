‘परो मात्रया ' इति सप्तर्चं दशमं सूक्तं वसिष्ठस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभम्। 'उरुं यज्ञाय ' इत्याद्यास्तिस्र ऐन्द्रावैष्णव्यः शिष्टाः केवलविष्णुदेवताकाः। तथा चानुक्रान्तं -- परो वैष्णवं तूरुमित्यैन्द्र्यश्च तिस्रः ' इति । गतः सूक्तविनियोगः । विष्णुदेवताके पशौ ‘परो मात्रया' इति पुरोडाशस्य याज्या । सूत्रितं च - परो मात्रया तन्वा वृधानेरावती धेनुमती हि भूतम्' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ३. ८) इति ॥

Viṣṇu (1–3, 7), Indra and Viṣṇu (4–6)  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
As has been discussed previously, Viṣṇu, one of the great gods of classical Hinduism,  is a marginal figure in the R̥gveda, generally associated with Indra. Viṣṇu’s primary  mythic exploit in Vedic is the “three strides” he made across the cosmos, measuring  out, enlarging, and mapping the cosmic spaces. In middle Vedic literature and later,  Viṣṇu takes the form of a dwarf when making these vast strides, but there is no trace  of this notion in the R̥gveda.  
The first three verses of this hymn are addressed solely to Viṣṇu and allude to his  establishment and fixation of the cosmic spaces, though without directly mention ing his three strides. The first verse does sketch (in the second half) the three sepa rate realms with which Viṣṇu is associated, an indirect reference to the three strides;  but in verses 2 and 3 the action that creates the spaces is “propping,” an action  more characteristic of Indra. However, in verse 3 Viṣṇu fastens the earth down  with “loom pegs,” a homely device in a way. The word (mayū́kha) is found only one  other time in the R̥gveda, in verse 2 of the late hymn X.130, where the creation of  the sacrifice is likened to weaving. This verse is also noteworthy for Viṣṇu’s direct  address to Heaven and Earth as he props them apart.  
The second three verses (4–6) are dedicated to Indra and Viṣṇu together, and  though heroic deeds are attributed to both of them, the deeds themselves are ones  assigned only to Indra elsewhere (e.g., the destruction of Śambara and of Varcin in  vs. 5). It is not unusual in hymns addressed to dual divinities for the more dynamic  mythology of one to be credited to both.  
The final verse is dedicated to Viṣṇu alone (Śipiviṣṭa being an enigmatic epithet  of Viṣṇu found in the R̥gveda only in this and the following hymn), though the sen timents of the verse are conventional. For further on the epithet, see the next hymn.
