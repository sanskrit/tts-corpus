Vāyu (1, 3), Indra and Vāyu (2, 4–7)  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The last half of this hymn (vss. 4cd through 7, the last verse being repeated from  VII.90.7) is a straightforward invitation to Indra and Vāyu to journey to the sacri fice, bringing goods to distribute, and to drink the soma. The first half of the hymn  is both more miscellaneous and more obscurely phrased. True, verse 2 also issues  the invitation to the two gods, but it is sandwiched between two verses with which it  seems to have little in common.  
Verse 1 is variously interpreted, with its parts variously arranged in translation.  In our interpretation it contains speculation about the prior existence of the gods  and the beginning of ritual activity: the gods who now derive their strength from  men’s sacrifices must have existed before the sacrifice began, the proof being that  these gods created the dawn and the sun for both Vāyu, a god of the midspace, and  for Manu, the first man and first sacrificer, under trying conditions. (A somewhat  similar situation is depicted in VI.49.13, where Viṣṇu measures out the realms for  “hard-pressed Manu,” another cosmogonic deed.) The creation of dawn would in  turn allow the ritual process, the ritual day, to begin—and begin it does with the  offering to Vāyu. Verse 3 is clearly a depiction of the sacrifice, but the referents of the  various phrases are not entirely certain. Although most scholars consider Vāyu the  subject of the first half-verse, on the basis of shared vocabulary we instead consider  it a disguised reference to the soma and its usual accompaniment, cow’s milk. The  soma drops then offer themselves to Vāyu. The first half of verse 4 complements the  concerns in verse 1: in the first verse the time before the creation of the sacrifice by  the gods is the subject of speculation; in 4ab the unbounded continuance of the sac rifice is envisioned, for as long as men have the power to perform it. With these ends  of the sacrifice demarcated, the offering to Indra and Vāyu in the here-and-now can  proceed, and the simple invitation of the rest of the hymn is issued to them.
