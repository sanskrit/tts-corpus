‘ ब्रह्मा ण इन्द्र' इति पञ्चर्चमेकादशं सूक्तं वसिष्ठस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभमैन्द्रम्। ब्रह्मा णः' इत्यनुक्रान्तम् । महाव्रते निष्केवल्ये पञ्चमत्वेनास्य सूक्तस्य विनियोग उक्तः । अष्टमेऽहनि प्रउगशस्त्र आद्यस्तृच ऐन्द्रः ( आश्व. श्रौ. ८. १०)॥

Indra  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Another hymn in this series concerned with competition between sacrificers. The  first verse exhorts Indra to heed only our call, though others are calling, too, and in  the second verse the phrase “penetrate through” seems to refer to Indra’s ability to  ignore the competitive calls in order to come to ours. The second half of verse 2 and  verse 3 then turn to Indra’s great deeds, but this section is connected to the first by a  word play. Although it cannot be rendered easily in English, both the “vie in invok  
ing” of verse 1 and the “penetrate through” in verse 2 contain the preverb ví “apart,  through,” which is in regular opposition to sám “together.” In verse 3 it is said that  Indra “united” the two world-halves, using a verb phrase including the preverb  sám (literally “lead together”). But the cosmogonic deed that is regularly credited  to Indra is rather the separation or pushing apart of the same two world-halves  (for a nearby example see VII.23.3); we contend that here this underlying formula is evoked by its opposite—the audience, familiar with the verbal formulae encap sulating Indra’s great deeds, would understand “lead together [sám]” as “lead apart [ví],” primed by the ví forms found earlier in the hymn. For another example of an  underlying formula appearing on the surface as its opposite, see Jamison (1982/83).  
Verse 4 is notable because of the intrusion of Varuṇa into this Indra hymn,  and Varuṇa in his role as observer and judge of the moral behavior of humans.  Varuṇa is the tutelary deity of Vasiṣṭha (see the remarkable series of Varuṇa hymns,  VII.86–89 below), but Varuṇa’s presence is otherwise not found, or expected, in  Indraic context. Since the last verse (5) is a refrain verse, in this Indra hymn Varuṇa  has the last word, as it were. For Mitra and Varuṇa’s parentage of Vasiṣṭha, see  VII.33.10–14.
