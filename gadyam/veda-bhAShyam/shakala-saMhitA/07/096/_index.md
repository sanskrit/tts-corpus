6 verses: br̥hatī 1, satobr̥hatī 2, prastārapaṅkti 3, as extended pragātha; gāyatrī 4–6,  as trcḁ  
This hymn is not metrically unified (see Oldenberg 1888: 200). The first three verses,  dedicated to Sarasvatī, consist of a pragātha (vss. 1–2) of the usual type (br̥hatī alter nating with satobr̥hatī), extended with a third verse in prastārapaṅkti (12 12 8 8). The1004 VII.96  
other three verses form a conventional tr̥ca, dedicated to Sarasvant, whose charac ter seems little different from his better-known counterpart Sarasvatī. It is perhaps  the identity of the “bachelors” in verse 4 that suggests that prayer to a male divinity  would be appropriate. But the attribution of a “swelling breast” to this same male  in verse 6 is distinctly odd; a nourishing, wealth-giving breast (using the same word  stána) for suckling is attributed in I.164.49 to Sarasvatī, a more suitable figure by  her gender.  
The phrase “both stalks” (ubhé . . . ándhasī) in verse 2 has occasioned much  discussion, and in recent years some political and military conclusions have  been drawn from one quite speculative interpretation of it—conclusions not  justified by the evidence, in our opinion. Although most interpreters take the  “two stalks” as referring to two different beverages, one of which is soma (the  usual referent of singular ándhas is the soma stalk), either soma and surā or  soma and milk, some, following Grassmann, interpret the word as referring  metaphorically to the two banks of the river. From this interpretation it is  inferred that the Pūrus crossed the Sarasvatī and conquered the territory on the  other side—a conclusive leap based on a shaky interpretation of this word. By  contrast, we interpret the term on the basis of the twinned hymn VII.95, whose  corresponding verse 2 states that Sarasvatī “milked out ghee and milk,” a liquid  pairing that may well be referred to by the dual in verse 2 of this immediately  following hymn.
