Aśvins  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn is marked by the repeated invitations to the Aśvins to “journey here”  (ā́...yātam, vss. 1, 2, and 5), which create a ring of the hymn’s beginning and end.  The urgent pleas that the Aśvins come here to this place, to this sacrifice and not to  another, is reinforced by other words meaning “near” or “this way” (arvā́k, 2a) and  “here” (áchā, 3d). Only verse 4 counters by opening with ví, here translated “forth,”  but more exactly signifying “away, apart.” This verse shifts the attention to the  spreading light of dawn (pādas a, c), which is matched in pāda d by the spreading  light of the sacrificial fires and in b by the poetic formulations rising from the sing ers. The last verse joins the expansiveness of verse 4 to the invitation to the Aśvins  by describing the four directions in which the Aśvins are present and from which  they can come to the sacrifice at the center.974 VII.73  
The four directions and the implicit center in verse 4 are reflected in the “wealth  belonging to the five peoples” (vs. 5c), that is, the wealth belonging to all the Vedic  clans and tribes. This wish also suggests that this hymn is recited on behalf of  one who sees himself, his tribe, or his clan at the center of the Vedic peoples. The  Vasiṣṭha poet is not shy about pointing to his family’s connection to the center  either, since he speaks of the familial formulations that “awaken” in order to bring  the Aśvins (vs. 3ab).
