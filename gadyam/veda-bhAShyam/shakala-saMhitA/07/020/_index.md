॥ श्रीगणेशाय नमः ॥

यस्य निःश्वसितं वेदा यो वेदेभ्योऽखिलं जगत् ।

निर्ममे तमहं वन्दे विद्यातीर्थमहेश्वरम् ॥

अथ तृतीयोऽध्याय आरभ्यते । “उग्रो जज्ञे' इति दशर्चं तृतीयं सूक्तं वसिष्ठस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभमैन्द्रम् । तथा चानुक्रम्यते- उग्रो दश' इति । आभिप्लविके चतुर्थेऽहनि निष्केवल्य एतत्सूक्तं निविद्धानम् । सूत्रितं च -- चतुर्थस्योग्रो जज्ञ इति निष्केवल्यम्' (आश्व. श्रौ. ७. ७ ) इति । महाव्रतेऽपि निष्केवल्य एतत्सूक्तम् । तथैव पञ्चमारण्यके सूत्रितम्- उग्रो जज्ञे वीर्याय स्वधावानुदु ब्रह्माण्यैरत श्रवस्या' (ऐ. आ. ५. २. २.) इति । सौमिकचातुर्मास्येषु वैश्वदेवस्य स्थाने प्रथमं पृष्ठ्यमहः । तत्रापि निष्केवल्य एतत्सूक्तं निविद्धानम्। सूत्रितं च - ‘जनिष्ठा उग्र उग्रो जज्ञ इति मध्यंदिनः' (आश्व. श्रौ. ९:२) इति ॥

Indra  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn begins (vss. 1–2) by implicitly contrasting Indra’s history, in the odd  pādas, with his current activity in the even ones. It continues with praise especially  of Indra’s martial powers (vss. 3–5). Verse 5 takes up the theme of Indra’s birth,  found in the first pāda of the hymn, but it is not entirely clear who the father and  mother are. In our opinion this is only a metaphorical reference to birth: Indra’s  vivification at the soma sacrifice, with the bull-father actually soma, referred to in  the immediately preceding pāda (4d). The identification of the mother is more dif  
ficult in this interpretation: it could be a reference to the cow whose milk is mixed  with soma. A non-ritual reading of the verse is also possible, with the father and  mother the unnamed parents of Indra referred to elsewhere in the R̥gveda.  
The second half of the hymn (vss. 6–10) describes the usual reciprocal relation  between worshiper and god:  anyone who gives the appropriate ritual devotion to  Indra will be appropriately rewarded (see esp. vss. 6, 8). Yet the poet is not entirely  sure Indra is doing his part, and in verse 7 he rather saucily (and even slangily) con  
trasts the proper patron–client behavior among humans with Indra’s failure to come  through. The poet also treats himself somewhat mockingly: in verse 9 he compares his  praise first to a bellowing bull and then—in our view (the relevant word is a disputed  hapax)—to another animal with a wailing or screeching cry, perhaps a monkey. But  these light moments give way to the usual pleas for benefits at the end of the hymn.

Indra 19 This hymn shows some stylistic tics, esp. a penchant for oddly placed particles (vss. 2, 4, 5) and for final enclitics (1d, 7d, 8b, 9a, 9d, as well as the refrain 10d).
