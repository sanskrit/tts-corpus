Mitra and Varuṇa  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is similar in theme and phrasing to the preceding hymn, with which it  also shares the final verse. It too is fundamentally a prayer for rain to Mitra and  Varuṇa. There is no reference to Aryaman, although there is an indirect reference  to his function as god of customs in the poet’s description of Mitra and Varuṇa as  aryá “civilizing” (vs. 2a). Verse 4 most explicitly states the theme of the hymn. In  pāda a the poet offers the gods oblations, which include ghee and other ritual liba  
tions, and in b he asks for these in return, though in the form of rain. In c we read  váram “wish” twice, once in the phrase práti... váram “at your wish,” referring to  the wish of the gods for oblations, and second in the phrase váram ā́...pr̥ṇītám “fill  our wish” for rain. Thus in both ab and cd, the poet first refers to the desire of the  gods and then his own desire.  
The translation below also takes víśva “everyone” twice in the translation of  verse 1, which, like the first verse of the preceding hymn, offers a possible double  reading. According to the translation below, in pāda d Mitra and Varuṇa move  “upon the course of everyone,” that is, they follow or accompany the actions of all  beings. But yā́man “course” can also mean “entreaty,” and if construed with ācít  
“attentive,” the line could also mean, “moving on the course of everyone, attentive  to the entreaty of everyone.”
