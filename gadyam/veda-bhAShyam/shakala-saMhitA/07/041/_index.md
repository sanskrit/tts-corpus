Bhaga, except Assorted Divinities (1) and Dawn (7)  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1  
Like the last hymn, this one is completely devoted to our acquisition of wealth by  distribution, but here the distribution is ascribed almost entirely to Bhaga, the god  of Fortune, whose name also means “portion.” The hymn begins (vs. 1) with a gen eral invocation of a range of gods in early morning, including Bhaga, but the next  five verses (2–5) call insistently on Bhaga, punning several times on his name. The  early-morning context of the hymn returns with the last two verses (6–7), concern ing the Dawns, who bring Bhaga with them (vs. 6). The final verse, which does not  mention Bhaga, is found also in a Dawn hymn later in the VIIth Maṇḍala (VII.80.3)  and is clearly extra-hymnic here.

Bhaga (or All Gods) Like VII.38, which is essentially an All Gods hymn though ascribed by the Anukramaṇī to Savitar, this hymn is properly located within the All Gods sequence, the last of three 7-verse hymns in Triṣṭubh (save for our vs. 1 in Jagatī), followed by an All Gods hymn of 6 vss. Nonetheless, the Anukramaṇī assigns most of it (vss. 2- 6) to Bhaga, with vs. 1 to the Liṅgoktadevatāḥ and vs. 7, an extrahymnic vs. (see published introduction.) to Uṣas. The 1st vs. calls on a range of gods, including Bhaga (pāda c), in 66 monotonous fashion, before settling down to exclusive focus on Bhaga beginning with vs. 2, and it was surely meant as an All God hymn and positioned in the All God collection for that reason. The hymn is also found in AV (Ś III.16, P IV.31)
