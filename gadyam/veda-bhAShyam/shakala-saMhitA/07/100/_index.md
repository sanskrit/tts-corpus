Viṣṇu  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn begins conventionally enough, with a mortal offering sacrifice to the god  (vs. 1) and a request for gifts in return (vs. 2). Viṣṇu’s three strides are the subject  of the following two, responsive verses (3–4). Verse 3d also introduces the theme  of Viṣṇu’s name, which is the subject of the last two real verses of the hymn (5–6,  since vs. 7 is merely a repetition of the final verse of VII.99). The enigmatic epithet  śipiviṣṭá found in the last verse of the last hymn (VII.99.7) is, as it were, interrogated  in these verses. In verse 6 the poet, who boasts that he knows the hidden patterns,  sets out to proclaim the god’s name, while addressing him as Śipiviṣṭa, and then  asks in the next verse whether the god’s own proclamation of himself as Śipiviṣṭa  was meant to be ignored or passed over. The poet then mysteriously alludes to two  different forms of the god, which may (or may not) correspond to two different  names. The hymn does not resolve these questions, perhaps leaving the shadowy  figure of Viṣṇu to be fully developed in the ensuing centuries.
