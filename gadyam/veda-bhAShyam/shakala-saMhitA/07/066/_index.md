Mitra and Varuṇa (1–3, 17–19), Ādityas (4–13), Sūrya  (14–16)  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
19 verses: gāyatrī 1–9, 17–19, arranged in trcas; br ̥ hat ̥ ī alternating with satobr̥hatī 10–15, arranged in pragāthas; puraüṣṇih 16  
This hymn consists of eight metrical units of various meters. The first three are three  gāyatrī tr̥cas, followed by three br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī strophes and one more gāyatrī tr̥ca.  The hymn then concludes with a final, single puraüṣṇih verse. Despite its metrical  complexity, the hymn sustains its basic themes throughout. Once again this is a  hymn recited at sunrise, and indeed the phrase “at the rising of the sun” occurs  at the beginning of three of its seven strophes (vss. 4, 7, 12). Also the beginning  of fourth strophe (vs. 14) contains a variant of the phrase, the final tr̥ca starts (vs.  16) with a reference to the rising of the sun, and the pragātha beginning at verse 10  opens with a mention of the sun. Therefore of the hymn’s eight units, only the first  tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), which establishes Mitra and Varuṇa as the dedicands of the hymn,  and the final summary invitation to Mitra and Varuṇa lack a reference to the rising  sun in its first verse. This repeated mention of the rising sun is a structuring device  that unifies the hymn despite the diversity of its meter. Thematically, the rise and  movement of the Sun across the heavens becomes the representation of the Ādityas’  lordship extending across the world.  
The actions of the Ādityas are also linked with the words and action of the  ritual. This theme is introduced at the outset, when they are described as sudákṣa “of good skill” and the children of Dakṣa, the embodiment of skill and specifically  sacrificial skill (vs. 2). The gods sustain “the three divisions” (vs. 10), a phrase that  likely refers both to the divisions of the world (earth, midspace, and heaven), and  to the divisions of the ritual (the three soma-pressings). They also sustain the divi sions of time (vs. 11): the year, month, and day, but also the sacrifice and the night,  a division that could refer to the sacrificial rites by day and the continuation of the  rites across the night. The Ādityas “impel” (√sū)—a word connected with Savitar,  of course, and therefore with the Ādityas—the sacrificers and thereby bring their  rituals success and take their worshipers “across difficult straits” (vss. 4–5).964 VII.66
