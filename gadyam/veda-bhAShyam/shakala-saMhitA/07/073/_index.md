Aśvins  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
This short hymn is a summons to the Aśvins at the break of dawn, “the further  shore of ...darkness.” In verse 2 the poet calls the Aśvins’ attention to Agni, the  sacrificial fire and the Hotar of the sacrifice, who has been installed and stands  ready to give the offerings to the Aśvins (2ab). All is ready for the Aśvins to con  
sume the soma and the other offerings presented to them (2cd). In verse 3a the poet  compares this sacrifice to a chariot speeding to the Aśvins. This image is answered  in verse 4ab, which looks forward to the arrival of the váhnī, the “two chariot horses.” The term can refer to the horses of the Aśvins, but it might also refer to  the Aśvins themselves as chariot-horses (cf. VIII.8.12). But in either case the idea is that the fully prepared sacrifice races to the Aśvins, and the Aśvins, with or as fully  equipped horses, race to the sacrifice. Again, in verse 4cd the poet draws attention  to the ritual preparations made for the Aśvins and begs the Aśvins not to ignore his  call and overlook his sacrifice. The last verse repeats the final verse of the preceding  hymn. Here it is not so closely tied to the themes of the hymn, but it appropriately  continues the plea to the Aśvins to travel from wherever they are to the sacrifice.
