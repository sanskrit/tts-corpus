Waters  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
4 verses: triṣṭubh  
In contrast to VII.47, the waters in this hymn have more physical definition: in par ticular, verse 2 gives a notable typology of types of water: “heavenly waters” (rain), “those that flow” (rivers), “those found by digging” (well water), and “those that  arise by themselves” (springs)—all of which end by flowing into the sea. But the  purity and purifying power of flowing waters, noted in the first three verses, gives  them a moral as well as a physical quality, and in verse 3 the god Varuṇa in his role  as observer and judge of human actions is found among them. From passages like  this it is easy to see how Varuṇa came to be so closely associated with the waters, a  dominant characteristic of Varuṇa in later times. Verse 4 moves from the physical  and moral to the ritual realm, to the employment of water in the soma sacrifice, the  theme that prevailed in VII.47.
