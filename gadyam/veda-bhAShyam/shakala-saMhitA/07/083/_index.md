Indra and Varuṇa  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
10 verses: jagatī  
This hymn looks back at the Battle of the Ten Kings described in VII.18, in which  the Bharata king Sudās with the help of the Vasiṣṭhas triumphed over an alliance  of ten rulers. This battle was a key moment in Vasiṣṭha history, and the poet recalls  this historic victory in order to extend it into the present. Now warriors allied with  the Vasiṣṭhas are going forth in their quest for cattle (vs. 1). Looking on Indra and  Varuṇa, who are present at the sacrifice, with their minds if not with their eyes and  thinking of their close association with the two gods, the poet and his allies call  upon the gods to help them. The cry to help Sudās in 1d replicates the call to which  the gods responded before and sets the stage for the poet’s recollection of the Ten  Kings’ battle.  
In verse 3 the poet re-enters the earlier battle and speaks as if he were part of it  or speaks in the voice of those who were. In the person of the earlier Vasiṣṭha, he  calls for help in the midst of the turmoil of battle. Then in verse 4ab he remembers  that the gods did help Sudās, and in 4cd the poet returns to his present, calling on  Indra and Varuṇa to hear him. Like the earlier Vasiṣṭha, the poet and his people  confront enemies on every side (vs. 5ab), and therefore he calls upon Indra and  Varuṇa to help at the critical time as they did before (5cd). The poet knows that  others summon the gods as well (vs. 6ab), but in verses 6cd–8 he recalls that the  gods chose to help Sudās and Vasiṣṭha and not the other kings and priests. In the  end the sacrifices of these others were inadequate, and in the end the gods were  present at the sacrifice of Vasiṣṭha (vss. 7–8). In verse 9 the poet distinguishes Indra  and Varuṇa for the first and only time in this hymn. While the two gods may have  different functions, both their divine functions apply to the poet’s present situation.  Indra can bring victory to the poet and his people and Varuṇa can defend them.
