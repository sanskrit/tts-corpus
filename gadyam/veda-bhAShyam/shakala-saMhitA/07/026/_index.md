‘ न सोम इन्द्रम्' इति पञ्चर्चं नवमं सूक्तं वसिष्ठस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभमैन्द्रम् । तथा चानुक्रम्यते-- ’ न सोमः पञ्च' इति । महाव्रत उक्तो विनियोगः ॥

Indra  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
This brief hymn displays several competing yet complementary types of structure.  On the one hand, the first two verses respond to each other and establish pressed  soma and hymns as the linked indispensible requisites of the sacrifice to Indra; the  doubly negative formulation of the first half of verse 1 is especially striking. The  last two verses (4–5) also respond to each other, each beginning with evā́ “in just  this way.” These two pairs of verses highlight the excluded verse 3, the middle verse,  as an omphalos, and this verse does contrast with the rest of the hymn in several  ways. It is the only place where Indra’s deeds are spoken of, and it also contains  in its second half a striking simile (the only simile describing Indra in the hymn),  in which the submission of fortresses to Indra is compared to the submission of  cowives to their common husband. Thus verse 3 is in a sense a miniature example of  proper praise-poetry, celebrating a god’s mythic exploits in artful language.  
A different structural feature pairs verse 1 with the final verse 5, in opposition  to the three middle verses (2–4). In the first verse the speaker is “I”; in the last (vs.  5) it is Vasiṣṭha, who is doubtless identical with the “I” of verse
