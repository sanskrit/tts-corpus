Agni Vaiśvānara  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
In its first verse this poem implicitly connects Agni with Varuṇa and Indra. In 1ab  Agni is called a “universal king and lord” to be honored “by the settlements.” This  description recalls Varuṇa and his rule over settled communities. Then in the second  hemistich Agni’s acts are explicitly compared to the heroic deeds of Indra during  war. The description of Agni as the “breaker”—if that is the meaning of dārú in  1d—is appropriate to him: in X.69.3d the poet asks of Agni sá vā́jaṃ darṣi “Break  out victory’s prize.” But the word also anticipates puraṃdará “breaker of strong  
holds” in 2c, here an epithet of Agni but normally one of Indra. In 2cd the two  gods, Indra and Varuṇa, are combined in Agni through the description of him as  puraṃdará and through reference to his vratá “commandment,” a term that is con ceptually and etymologically connected to Varuṇa. But then in verse 3 Agni takes  on the persona of Indra more exclusively as one who pursues the Paṇis, who are the  great enemies of Indra in his destruction of the Vala cave. The reference to Agni as  the one who brings the dawn in verses 4–5 is appropriate to the fire of the morning  sacrifice, but it also continues the reference to the Vala story, telling of the release  of the dawns. In verse 5cd Nahuṣ is the ancestor of the Nahuṣa, a tribe of whom  Agni takes possession. In I.31.11 Agni is the clanlord of the Nahuṣa, but it is still  not clear why they are mentioned here, although doing so does bring Agni’s action  down to earth and perhaps into the present. The last two verses give Agni posses  
sion of the whole earth, including the goods and peoples on it.
