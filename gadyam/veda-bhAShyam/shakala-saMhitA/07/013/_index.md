Agni Vaiśvānara  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
3 verses: triṣṭubh  
In each of the three verses of this hymn, the poet calls Agni vaíśvānara (vss. 1d, 2d,  3c), thereby identifying the emerging ritual fire with the rising sun. Because Agni is  the sun, he blazes everywhere, smashes enemies, fills heaven and earth with his light,  releases the gods from the curse (of darkness), looks upon all beings, and encom  
passes the earth. The poet brings to Agni his hymn as an offering in the hope that  with these powers Agni will bring success to the poet’s words.
