Agni Vaiśvānara  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn invokes Agni as both the fire on earth and the sun in heaven. More spe cifically, Agni is a tribal fire, which here represents an aggregation of clans in the  Pūru tribe (vs. 3). This hymn thus accords with VII.19.3, in which Indra also sup ports the Pūru tribe, but contrasts with VII.18.13, in which Indra supports Sudās,  the enemy of the Pūru. As Proferes (2007: 46–49) details, it is as a tribal fire and  as the sun that Agni is called Vaiśvānara, a name repeated in each of the first five  verses and then again in the last two (8–9).  
The hymn begins with a statement of Agni’s presence in heaven and on earth,  nurtured by both the gods and priests (vs. 1). In the second verse Agni is called  the master of both flowing and pooling waters, a theme echoed in verse 8, the  second to last verse, in which Agni is asked to send the “refreshing drink,” which  might be the rain for humans or the soma for the gods or both. Having descended to earth, Agni’s radiance extends to the Ārya clans (vs. 2cd). In verse 3 the  víśaḥ... aśiknīḥ “dark clans” are Dasyus (vs. 6), but they are not dark because they  are “dark-skinned,” as the description is often interpreted, but rather because they  represent powers of darkness opposed to the Āryas (cf. Hock 1999). Note that  the brilliance of Agni in 3cd breaks apart the “dark clans” and, as light, disperses  darkness. Or likewise in verse 6 Agni drives away the Dasyus, providing a “broad  light” for Āryas. As fire and sun, Agni extends his light throughout the worlds  (vs. 4). In verse 5, the middle verse of the hymn, the poet concretizes Agni as the  present sacrificial fire, who guards and prospers the different communities and as  both the sacrificial fire and the sun, both of which appear in the early morning as  beacons of the day.
