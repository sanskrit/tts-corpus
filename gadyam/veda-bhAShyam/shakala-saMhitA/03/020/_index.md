‘अग्निमुषसम्' इति पञ्चर्चमष्टमं सूक्तं त्रैष्टुभम् । अत्रेयमनुक्रमणिका- अग्निमुषसमाद्यान्त्ये वैश्वदेव्यौ ' इति । ‘ गाथी ह ' इति शब्दप्रयोगादस्यापि सूक्तस्य गाथी ऋषिः । प्रथमपञ्चम्यौ विश्वेदेवताके शिष्टास्तिस्र आग्नेय्यः । अस्य सूक्तस्योक्तो विनियोगः । मरुत्वतीयशस्त्रे: अग्निर्नेतः इत्येषा धाय्या । सूत्रितं च- अग्निर्नेता त्वं सोम ऋतुभिः पिन्वन्यप इति धाय्याः । ( आश्व. श्रौ. ५.१४ ) इति ॥

Agni and the All Gods  
Gāthin Kauśika  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn begins by naming deities of the morning, although in the last verse the  poet brings all the gods into his invocation. As in the previous hymn, the poet  employs ring composition, a point that the Anukramaṇī underscores by assigning  the address in both the first verse and the last verse not to Agni but to the All Gods. Also once again, the poet varies the first and last verses. Every verse except the last  one begins with “Agni.” But in that last verse Dadhikrā is transposed in front of  Agni. It is difficult to see if the poet has a purpose in mind other than marking the  last verse through this shift.  
However, fronting Dadhikrā, who is a deified horse, does underscore a return  to the equine imagery that opens the hymn. In verse 1 the poet not only mentions  the horse Dadhikrā and the two horsemen, the Aśvins, but he also calls the recit ing priest a váhni, a chariot-driver, whose horses may be his recitations, as Geldner  suggests. Then verse 2 refers to Agni’s vā́jinā, here translated “victorious charges.”  The meaning of the word is not certain, but it is in any case derived from vājín “racehorse” or “prizewinning horse.” Overt references to horses and racing then  subside until the last verse.
