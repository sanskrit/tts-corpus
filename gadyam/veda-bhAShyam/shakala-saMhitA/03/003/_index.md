Agni Vaiśvānara  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
11 verses: jagatī  
In this hymn the poet stresses the dual role of Agni as fire and sun and therefore  as belonging to mortals and to gods. The movement between Agni as the sacrificial  fire and as the sun is announced in the first verse: Agni befriends the gods, and he  also maintains the integrity of the sacrifice for humans. Because he belongs to both  gods and mortals, Agni moves between the two world-halves, the sphere of the gods  in heaven and the place of mortals on earth—a theme repeated in verses 2, 4, 6,  and 10. Some of the more enigmatic aspects of this hymn may reflect the location  of Agni in both heaven and earth and the unity of Agni as sacrificial fire and as  the sun. In verse 8 Agni’s simultaneous connection to gods and mortals reaches a  climax, in which it is not clear which of the two is being talked about. Who or what  is being strengthened? Is it the gods, the kin of Manu, the sacrifice, or even Agni  himself? In verse 2 Agni’s “lofty dwelling place” could refer both to the place of the  sun in heaven or the place of the sacrificial fire.  
A special mystery concerns the last verse of the hymn, verse 11. In 11b, following  the suggestion of Geldner, we have taken Agni as the subject, and Agni’s semen as  the suppressed object. The reference, he suggests, is the mystery and paradox of Agni  as his own father, which is also found in III.2. The image is an unusual one, but sev  
eral elements of verse 11 suggest that it is Agni’s semen (rétas) that “flows on high.”  First, rétas is both present in pāda d and suggested by √rī “flow” in pāda b. Second,  that which is “flowing on high” in pādas ab results in Agni’s birth in cd. Finally, the  ellipsis of the object, which occurs between br̥hád / áriṇād, is solved in pāda d by  bhū́ri-retasā “having abundant semen,” which echoes br̥hád / áriṇād phonologically  and thereby suggests “semen” as the missing object. The mystery also brings back  the theme of the Agni as sun and as sacrificial fire, since the fire who is single and  who makes semen flow on high is likely the sun. In any case, that theme is restated in  the last lines, which identify the parents of Agni as both Heaven and Earth.
