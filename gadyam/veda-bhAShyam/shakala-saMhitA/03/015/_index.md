Agni  
Utkīla Kātya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
This and the next hymn are attributed to Utkīla Kātya, the grandson of Viśvāmitra.  The hymn describes the morning fire, who is the protector and guide of the sacri ficers. Some of the language in the hymn is evocative of Indra, although Indra is  never mentioned. A  possible oblique reference to Indra, however, might help us  understand verse 4, the central and most puzzling verse in the hymn. There Agni is  invoked as an “invincible bull” who conquers fortresses, a description that strongly  evokes Indra, since it is Indra (or twice Soma acting as Indra) who is áṣāḷha “invin cible,” and it is Indra who characteristically breaks open fortresses. This overlay of  the image of Indra onto Agni may explain some of the complications in the second  half of the verse. In cd Agni is surely the “leader of the sacrifice,” but then who is  the pāyú, the “protector” whom he also leads? If he is the leader of the sacrifice,  Agni himself should be its protector as well. For this reason Oldenberg suggested  emending the text so that “protector” is a subject parallel to “leader.” But if we  accept the text as transmitted and translate “leader of its protector” rather than  “leader and protector,” could Agni lead Agni? Possibly he could, if the first Agni  were the priest Agni and the second were Agni as the embodiment of Indra, as sug  
gested in the first half of the verse. Or the poet may also be punning on pāyú, which  

means “protector” here as elsewhere (cf. VII.37.8), but which formally and sec ondarily—though only secondarily—could be derived from √pā “drink” and mean  “drinker,” a natural description of soma-drinking Indra. In short, the appearance  of Agni could be or could mark the appearance of Indra.
