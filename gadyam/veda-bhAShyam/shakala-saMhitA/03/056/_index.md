॥ श्रीगणेशाय नमः ।।

यस्य निःश्वसितं वेदा यो वेदेभ्योऽखिलं जगत् ।।

निर्ममे तमहं वन्दे विद्यातीर्थमहेश्वरम् ॥

'न ता मिनन्ति' इत्यष्टर्चं तृतीयं सूक्तं विश्वामित्रस्य वाचः पुत्रस्य वा प्रजापतेरार्षं  त्रैष्टुभं वैश्वदेवम् । तथा चानुक्रमणिका- न ताष्टौ ' इति । सूक्तविनियोगो लिङ्गादवगन्तव्यः । अस्मिन् सूक्ते प्रायेणादित्यैः सह संवत्सरः स्तूयते ॥

All Gods  
Prajāpati Vaiśvāmitra or Prajāpati Vācya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Another enigmatic and mystical All God hymn, with its mysteries, as so often,  couched in numerological terms, primarily as threes or multiples of three. In the  earlier parts of the hymn these numbers seem to refer to cosmic entities—perhaps,  for example, the three heavens and three earths making up the six in verse 2—and  to cosmic creation, though the details are far from clear. But the number three takes  a strongly ritual turn beginning with verse 5, referring to three daily rites, that is, to  the three pressings of the soma sacrifice. Thus the poet implicitly identifies ritual  structure with cosmic structure.

All Gods I will not attempt to further identify the referents in these enigmatic vss.

beyond the sketchy suggestions given in the published intr. Ample disc. can be found in the standard tr. As in many such mystical hymns, the grammar is mostly quite straightforward; it’s the purport that remains cloaked in obscurity.
