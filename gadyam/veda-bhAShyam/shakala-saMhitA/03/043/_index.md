Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Although this hymn, like the two immediately preceding it (41, 42), focuses on  Indra’s journey to and presence at the soma sacrifice, its texture is richer and its  rhetoric more shapely. (It is also in the longer triṣṭubh meter, rather than the gāyatrī of the previous two.) The first four verses insistently establish the journey motif  with the opening “Here—drive” (ā́... yāhi, vss. 1–3) / “Here ...” (ā́, vs. 4), along  with an abundance of adverbs meaning “here, nearby, up close.” Verse 5 consists  of four rhetorical questions, each introduced by the interrogative particle kuvíd,  implicitly begging Indra’s intervention on the singer’s behalf. The initial “Here ...”  and the journey motif return in verse 6; verse 7, the last before the refrain, invites  Indra, presumably finally arrived, to drink the soma, inserting brief mentions of  two well-known myths, the falcon’s stealing of soma and Indra’s opening of Vala.  As is common in these journey hymns, Indra’s horses have a prominent part in the  hymn (see esp. vs. 6, but also vss. 1–4).
