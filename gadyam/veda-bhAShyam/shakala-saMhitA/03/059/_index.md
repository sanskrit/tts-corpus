Mitra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
9 verses: triṣṭubh 1–5, gāyatrī 6–9  
Mitra is usually invoked along with Varuṇa; this is the only hymn in the R̥gveda  to Mitra alone. Here he is addressed as the god of alliances who “organizes” the  peoples (vss. 1, 5), that is, who oversees the agreements, treaties, marriages, and  other forms of alliance by which people assume relationships with one another.  Just as the human king must abide by and protect such relationships, so Mitra as a  

divine king provides divine sanction for them. The first verse underscores the  nature of Mitra and plays on the appellative sense of mitrá “alliance.” It means  both that the god of alliances arranges people when he is addressed and that an  alliance arranges people when it is pronounced. This hymn marks the birth of an  alliance, figured in verse 4 as the birth of Mitra himself at this time and in this  place. The hymn does not say what kind of alliance has been born, but one possi  
bility, suggested especially in the final two verses, is that it is the reciprocal alliance  between gods and humans established through the sacrifice. In this alliance humans  empower the gods through their praises and offerings, and the gods are expected to  reciprocate by prospering humans.  
This hymn has been the subject of a close study by Thieme (1957: 38–59).
