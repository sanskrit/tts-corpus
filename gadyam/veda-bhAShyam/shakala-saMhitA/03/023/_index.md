Agni  
Devaśravas Bhārata and Devavāta Bhārata  
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except satobr̥hatī 3  
The Agni of this hymn is probably the tribal fire of the Bhāratas (Proferes 2007: 37),  which forms the ritual center of the Bhārata clans. This Agni governs the peoples (vs.  

3)—likely the peoples of the tribe, as Proferes suggests—from a location, “earth’s most  desirable place” (vs. 4), among the three rivers. Various theories have been offered for  the identity of Devaśravas, who is addressed in verse 3, and Devavāta, to whom the  Agni of the Bhāratas belong. Surely Devavāta is or was the king of the Bhāratas, since  his is the Bhārata fire. Devaśravas could be a priest or poet, or he could have been a  Bhārata leader, perhaps an ally or successor of Devavāta. In any case, along with the  Agni of the Bhāratas himself, they are the focus of the hymn since they are named in  the central verse and this central verse is marked by a change in meter.
