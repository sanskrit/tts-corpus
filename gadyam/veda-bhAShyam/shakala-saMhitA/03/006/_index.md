Agni  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
From its beginning, this hymn signals Agni’s dual roles as priest and ritual fire and  as fire on earth and fire among the gods. The first verse contains a sustained śleṣa,  a word, or in this case a gapped word, with a double sense. The gapped feminine  noun is probably the juhū́, the sacrificial ladle with which the butter offerings are  poured in the fire. But she can also be the tongue of the poet—not so incidentally,  another meaning of the word juhū́—or even the speech of the poets. If one of the  two latter, then dakṣiṇāvā́ṭ can mean not or not only “conveying to the right” but  also, as Geldner suggests, “conveying the priestly gift” (dakṣiṇā) to the Hotar Agni.  Similarly, in verse 2, the draft-horses are primarily the flames of Agni, but they can  also be the priests of the sacrifices.  
From verse 3 the poet launches into his principal theme: the position of Agni  himself as the intermediary between gods and humans, himself a kind of divine  śleṣa, who is simultaneously a Hotar for humans and a Hotar for the gods. The  references to Heaven and Earth (vss. 3, 4) or to the “two world-halves” (vss. 5,  10) point toward his role as intermediary between earth and heaven. Similarly, in  verse 7 Agni appears as both the heavenly fire, the sun, and as the earthly fire of  the sacrifice. Reflecting his double manifestation, the first line of this verse could  mean that Agni shines either as the earthly fire “to heaven” or as the sun “from  heaven.”
