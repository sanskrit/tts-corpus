### Sages  
With a few exceptions, the hymns of Maṇḍala III belong to Viśvāmitra Gāthina  and other members of his family. Of the sixty-two hymns in the maṇḍala, the  Anukramaṇī states that Viśvāmitra himself composed all or parts of forty-six, along  with two others that might be his or that might belong to another poet (III.31, 38).  

The Anukramaṇī attributes four hymns in the Agni series (III.19–22) to Viśvāmitra’s  father, Gāthin Kauśika, and one Indra hymn (III.31) either to Viśvāmitra or to his  grandfather, Kuśika Aiṣīrathi. 

Vaiśvāmitras, Viśvāmitra’s sons or descendants, are  also represented in the maṇḍala: Kata (III.17–18), R̥ṣabha (III.13–14), and possi bly Prajāpati (III.38, 54–56), as is one grandson, Utkīla Kātya (III.15–16), the son  of Kata Vaiśvāmitra. 

Outside of III, a few verses (IX.67.13–15; X.137.5) and one  jointly composed hymn (X.167) are also attributed to Viśvāmitra. Likewise, other  Vaiśvāmitras appear among the composers of hymns in IX and X: Madhuchandas  (IX.1), Reṇu (IX.70, X.89), Aṣṭaka (X.104), and Pūraṇa (X.160). 

Among the  remaining poets of III mentioned by the Anukramaṇī are Devaśravas Bhārata and  Devavāta Bhārata, who, it says, together composed the Agni hymn, III.23. The  Anukramaṇī’s attribution may be drawn from the hymn itself, which mentions the  two. However, the Bhārata king Sudās was the patron of Viśvāmitra, and the inclusion of a hymn ostensibly by two Bhāratas may reflect the close connection between  the clans of the poet and the king.+++(5)+++

### Gods  
The Viśvāmitra collection is dominated by hymns to Agni (1–29) and to Indra  (30–53). It concludes with four hymns to the All Gods (54–57) and single hymns  to the Aśvins (58), Mitra (59), the R̥bhus (60), and Dawn (61). 

The hymn to Mitra  is the only hymn dedicated solely to this god in the R̥gveda and perhaps shows  a special affinity between Mitra and his partial namesake, Viśvāmitra.+++(5)+++ 

The last  hymn (62) is a collection of tr̥cas to six different deities or pairs of deities, including  some not otherwise represented in the maṇḍala. The hymn would not be especially  noteworthy, except that verse 10, dedicated to Savitar, is the Gāyatrī mantra, the  best-known verse in the R̥gveda.+++(5)+++

Within the Agni series is a hymn (III.8) to the sacrificial post or posts, to which  sacrificial animals would have been tied. Also in this series is a hymn (III.12) to  the dual divinities, Indra and Agni. They are brought together here because Agni,  representing the sacrifice, and Indra, representing the warriors, jointly lead the clans’ victorious march across the rivers. Another unusual Agni hymn is III.26,  which follows the process of kindling the sacrificial fire and anticipates the later  Āgnimāruta śastra. 

### Indra series  
In the Indra series, a historically and literarily significant  hymn is III.33, which addresses the Rivers, Viśvāmitra himself, and Indra, and  which the Anukramaṇī attributes to the Rivers and Viśvāmitra. The reason for the  Anukramaṇī’s attribution is that this hymn is a dialogue between Viśvāmitra and  the Vipāś and Śutudrī Rivers. The poet approaches the Rivers and asks them to  stop in order to allow the Bhāratas to cross.+++(5)+++ These two rivers are the modern Beas  and Sutlej, which are part of the Indus river complex, and crossing these rivers may  mark a raid, seasonal migration, or resettlement from the west toward the east. In  III.33, which likely marks a later period in the Bhāratas’ migration, they are in the  area of the Sarasvatī, Dr̥ṣadvatī, and Āpayā rivers, and although the identification  of these rivers is controversial, they probably place the Bhāratas in Kurukṣetra, east  of the Vipāś and Śutudrī. 

Also in the Indra series is a cosmogonic hymn, III.38,  which describes the origin of the material of creation and the division of that mate rial into names and forms. Like the even more famous X.129, the hymn compares  the creativity that founded the world to the creativity of the poet. The last hymn of  the Indra series and a supplement to it is III.53, which is a praise of Viśvāmitra and  his family and of King Sudās and the Bhāratas, whom they serve.  

### Signature  
One of the distinctive characteristics of this maṇḍala is that its poets mark seven  of its Agni hymns (1, 5, 6, 7, 15, 22, and 23) and twelve of its Indra hymns (30, 31,  32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 43, 48, 49, and 50) with a final verse that identifies the hymn as  a Vaiśvāmitra creation.+++(5)+++ Other poetic families also have such signature verses, but the  Viśvāmitras have one for their Agni hymns and a different one for the Indra hymns.
