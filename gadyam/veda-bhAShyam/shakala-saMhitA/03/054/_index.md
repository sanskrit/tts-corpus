All Gods  
Prajāpati Vaiśvāmitra or Prajāpati Vācya  
22 verses: triṣṭubh  
This first hymn to the All Gods in this maṇḍala is something of a hybrid, combining  two standard approaches to All God hymns. On the one hand, the second half of  the hymn (starting with vs. 11) treats these deities as a list, granting a verse each to a  number of gods and mentioning their familiar characteristics. This part is relatively  straightforward.  
The first half, especially verses 2–9, is ostensibly devoted to Heaven and  Earth, but, though it begins as a conventional praise of those paired deities,  as often in All God hymns the divinity provides a point of departure for spec ulation on the nature of things and unanswered questions about cosmic mat ters; see especially the questions in verse 5, at the middle of this self-contained  hymn-within-a-hymn. The emphasis on truth and reality and on the discovery of  Heaven and Earth (for both themes see vss. 3–4), in combination with the uncer tain questions, suggests that the point is that we only gradually and imperfectly  discover the real dimensions and nature of the cosmos. The style in this portion  is enigmatic, intense, and rhetorically intricate, especially in the climactic verse 9,  where Heaven as the divine begetter, and perhaps the single principle, and heaven  as a place, the home of the gods to which we also aspire, seem to be referred to  simultaneously. This double reference is aided by the ambiguity of the first verb  in the verse, ádhy emi, which can mean either “I go upon” or “I study.” Verse 10  clearly closes off that part of the hymn and makes the transition to the second  part and its list of favored gods.  
The hymn begins with a verse to Agni and ends with a verse and a half to him,  thus providing a larger ring around the two very different halves.
