Agni  
Gāthin Kauśika  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
This is the first of a small collection of hymns, III.19–22, attributed to Gāthin,  the son of Kuśika. According to the Sarvānukramaṇī, Gāthin was the father of  Viśvāmitra, although in III.33.5 Viśvāmitra calls himself a son of Kuśika.  
In general, the hymn is similar to IV.6. See especially verse 2, which has many  of the same themes and much of the same vocabulary as IV.6.3. Its most obvi ous structural feature is the ring defined by 1a and 5a. One difference between  the two lines, however, is that the poet chooses Agni in verse 1, but the gods  anoint Agni in verse 5.  This change echoes the shifts throughout the hymn  between the priests and Agni. In verse 2ab first “I” perform a ritual offering to  Agni, and then in cd Agni performs a ritual act. Verse 3 begins as if it is still  describing Agni, especially if the gapped verb is sám √śri “provide” from 2d, but  

by the end of the first line the subject needs to be read as the priest. In 3b the  action of both Agni and the priest is characterized as “striving.” In verse 4 the  people performing the ritual are “eager to sacrifice,” but it is Agni who “will  sacrifice.” This shifting between humans and the god Agni signifies the closing  gap between humans and the gods.  
The hymn also contains two problematic ellipses. As mentioned above, 3a gaps  the verb, and although we have supplied “provide,” this is not the only possibility.  In verse 2 because of another ellipsis there is some ambiguity about the ritual act  that the “I” performs. By the end of the hemistich the reference to the sacrificial  ladle, the juhū́, is fairly clear, but initially what is sent to Agni could be vā́c “speech”  or suṣṭutí “good praise” (vs. 3) or the like, accompanied by offerings (e.g., X.188.2  prá...iyarmi suṣṭutím).
