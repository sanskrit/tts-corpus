R̥bhus and Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
7 verses: jagatī  
The hymn announces that the present priests have recovered the skills of the R̥bhus  by which, although born as human “children of Manu” (vs. 3), they attained divin ity (vs. 2), immortality (vs. 3), and, like the gods, a share of the sacrifice (vs. 1). The  “form” that the R̥bhus adopt in verse 1 may be the divine form they have earned. In  verses 4–6 the poet turns to Indra and asks him to come to the soma-pressing along  with the R̥bhus, now fully divine, and to drink the soma in the company of the  R̥bhus. Because Indra and the R̥bhus are traveling by chariot, the poet deploys the  imagery of prizewinning racehorses throughout these last verses. He even calls the  R̥bhus themselves “prizewinners” in verse 7, though this metaphor is anticipated  by vā́javant in verses 5 and 6. “Vāja” is the name of one of the R̥bhus, so on one  level this means that Vāja is in the company of the other R̥bhus, but it also means  that the R̥bhus, since they ride in Indra’s chariot, are or will be accompanied by the  prize of victory.
