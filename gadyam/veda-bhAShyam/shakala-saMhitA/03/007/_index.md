॥ श्रीगणेशाय नमः ॥

वागीशाद्याः सुमनसः सर्वार्थानामुपक्रमे । यं नत्वा कृतकृत्याः स्युस्तं नमामि गजाननं ॥

यस्य निःश्वसितं वेदा यो वेदेभ्योऽखिलं जगत् । निर्ममे तमहं वंदे विद्यातीर्थमहेश्वरं ॥

Agni  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
Geldner describes this as a deliberately obscure morning hymn. The poet creates  this obscurity by rarely directly identifying the objects concerned, but rather refer ring to them through metaphors, especially of mares and bulls. One reason the poet  chooses this approach may be because he is simultaneously describing and thus  interconnecting three realities relevant to the morning ritual: the priests and their  activity, the appearance of the sacrificial fire and thus of the god Agni, and the ris ing of the sun, which is another form of Agni.  
Neither space nor certainty allows us to unpack all of the poet’s metaphors,  but the following brief discussion of a few can illustrate the complexity and pos sibilities of the poet’s imagery. Geldner suggests that the seven voices in verse 1  may be the seven rivers (as in III.1.6), but they might also be the voices of the  seven priests of the soma rite. Agni’s “mother and father” might be Earth and  Heaven—especially since his parents are probably Heaven and Earth in pāda  c. But they could also be the two fire-churning sticks, the aráṇis, in which case  mātárā might better be “the two mothers.” If the mātárā are both Earth and  Heaven and the churning sticks, then the poet may be deliberately exploiting the  paradox that Agni, the ritual fire, is the child of the churning sticks, and Agni,  perhaps as the sun, is the child of Heaven and Earth. In verse 2 Sāyaṇa among  others reasonably understands the mares to be the waters, but we suggest that  they might be, or again also be, Agni’s flames or rays of the sun. If we follow  these latter interpretations, then the “single cow” might be the sun, although this  identification is doubtful since the sun is not otherwise a cow or even female. The  choice of such an image for the sun, if it is such, might have been motivated by  the image of the flames as mares and milk-cows. Alternatively, Geldner thinks  the single cow is probably the sacrificial ladle, which is certainly possible. The  “seers,” who are the likely subject in verse 5 and who appear again in verse 7,  may be the saptarṣayaḥ “seven seers,” the seven stars of the Big Dipper, and  in both verses they may also be the seven priests of the soma rite. As Kiehnle  (1979:  83)  has observed, it is because they may be stars in verse 7 that vípra “inspired” can also have the more literal sense of “quivering,” that is, “twin kling.” Also in verse 7 the young bulls may be the flames of Agni (so Oldenberg)  or possibly the flames of the rising sun (Kiehnle).
