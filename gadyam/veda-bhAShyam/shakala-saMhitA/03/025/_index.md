Agni  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
5 verses: virāj  
As in the previous hymn, each verse begins with “Agni,” whom the poet addresses  in the beginning and the final two verses and who is the subject of verses 2 and  3. Actually verse 4 opens with a vā́yav índraś ca construction, which mixes a voca tive and a nominative, and so is a hybrid that may mark a transition between the  nominative of verse 3 and the vocative of verse 5. The hymn is also defined by ring  
composition: sūnúḥ (1a) / sūno (5b) // viśvávedāḥ (1b) / jātavedaḥ (5b). The phrase in the last verse “home of the waters” is somewhat puzzling, so much  so that Geldner assumes an ellipsis of nápāt, which would yield a translation “O  Agni, (child) of the waters, you are kindled in the home....” or the like. But there  is little in the hymn itself to suggest such an ellipsis, nor does Sāyaṇa read one here.  Although it is not clear exactly what the “home of the waters” refers to—it might  simply be the firewood—the end of the verse suggests that Agni makes all homes or  abodes great, wherever he is kindled.
