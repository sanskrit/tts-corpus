वैश्वामित्रे तृतीये पञ्चानुवाकाः । तत्र प्रथमेऽनुवाके द्वादश सूक्तानि । तत्र ' सोमस्य मा ' इति त्रयोविंशत्यृचं प्रथमं सूक्तम् । तथा चानुक्रान्तं-' सोमस्य त्र्यधिका ' इति । अस्य मण्डलद्रष्टा विश्वामित्र ऋषिः । अनुक्तत्वात् त्रिष्टुप् छन्दः । ' मण्डलादिष्वाग्नेयम् ' इति परिभाषयाग्निर्देवता । प्रातरनुवाकाश्विनशस्त्रयोस्त्रैष्टुभे छन्दसि विनियोगः । तथा च सूत्रितं-' सोमस्य मा तवसं प्रत्यग्निरुषस इति
त्रीणि ' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ४. १३) इति ।।

Agni  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
23 verses: triṣṭubh  
In our interpretation, Agni opens the hymn with a declaration that the priests have  kindled him to carry the oblations. The poet and the priests then confirm that they  have indeed laid the fire to begin the rite. Implied in the first two verses is thus the  birth of the sacrificial fire, and the birth of Agni then becomes the central theme  of the hymn. The first part of the hymn (vss. 3–14) reflects not only on the birth of  the ritual fire, but also on Agni’s ultimate birth from the waters. Indeed, throughout  much of the first half of the hymn, the verses can be taken as describing either the  birth of the ritual fire or the ultimate birth of Agni or both. The poem thus merges  Agni’s original or ultimate birth among the waters and his birth here in the sacrifice  to the accompaniment of the priestly recitations. This poetic strategy complicates  the translation and interpretation of the hymn. For example, verse 4 refers to the  “seven young women,” who are also the mares who tend to Agni (4cd) and who  

reappear again in verses 6 and 9. In verse 4 these seven women are likely the riv ers, as Geldner rightly notes, but in verse 6 they are identified, unexpectedly, as the  voices of the seven priests of the soma rite. Retrospectively, therefore, we can view  these women as both the rivers and the voices. Similarly in verse 11 the “kindred  
sisters” might be the rivers, or they might again be the voices of the priests. The identity of Agni’s father also complicates the story of Agni’s birth. In verse  10 Agni gives rise to Agni, and therefore Agni is also his own father. But then who  is the father in verse 9? Geldner and Renou think that his father there is Heaven,  Heaven’s udder the raincloud, and therefore the fire here is lightning. More likely,  however, the reference is to the ritual fire. If so, then the father in verse 9 might  be the priest churning the fire, the udder his voice, and the udder’s “spurts and  streams” the words of the priest. Or, again in light of verse 10, the father might  be Agni, who nurtures himself through the “spurts and streams” of his spreading  flames. Or, just as in the case of the “seven young women,” the poet may intend  several of these possibilities.  
As Geldner notes, from verse 15 the poet more unambiguously addresses the  ritual fire, though he does return to the theme of Agni’s births in verse 20. This time,  though, the reference may be not only to the ultimate origins of Agni but also and  primarily to the ritual fires of long ago and the ritual fire of the present.
