Indra, etc.  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
24 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 10, 16; anuṣṭubh 12, 20, 22; gāyatrī 13; br̥hatī 18  
This sprawling hymn, a supplement to the Indra collection, consists of at least  six different sections in five different meters. There is little or no connection  among the parts, which were probably originally independent. However, the  whole seems intended to glorify the poet Viśvāmitra and his family, the Kuśikas,  as well as his patron, King Sudās, and the Bharatas. Moreover, several of the  different parts have clear reminiscences of other hymns in the Indra cycle of this  maṇḍala, and so the hymn serves as a sort of summary of the themes of this  Indra collection.  
The beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–6) is the most conventional part, with its  invitation to Indra to come to our ritual with gifts and to drink the soma. The most  interesting feature is the mention of the pleasures of wife and home (vss. 4–6) and  the envoi to Indra in verse 6, urging him to go home after consuming the soma  at our sacrifice. (See also I.82.5–6.) This dismissal seems appropriate to the final  hymn of the Indra collection and may in part account for this little hymn being  appended here. The next section (vss. 7–14) is subtly soldered to the first:  the final word  of verse 6 is dákṣiṇāvat “accompanied by priestly gifts,” while the first phrase  of verse 7 is imé bhojā́ḥ “these benefactors”—the word bhojá is used through out the hymn devoted to the dakṣiṇā (X.106) to refer to the bestowers of the  priestly gifts. The whole of this second section concerns the relationship of the  poet Viśvāmitra and his family with his patron, King Sudās and his people, the  Bharatas, via the mediation of Indra, whose powers the poet can command for  the sake of Sudās and his subjects because of his poetic gifts. There are several  reminiscences of previous Indra hymns in III. Verse 7, with the patrons com  
pared to the Aṅgirases, recalls the extensive treatment of the Aṅgirases in III.31.  Verse 9 gives a synopsis of III.33, in which Viśvāmitra stops the rivers flowing so  Sudās and his troops can cross; the name Sudās is mentioned in this story only  here. Viśvāmitra’s family, the Kuśikas, are found here in verses 9–11; in III.33.5  he calls himself “the son of Kuśika,” and a repeated verse containing the plural  of the name serves as a ring-compositional marker for the whole of the Indra  cycle of Maṇḍala III (III.30.20 = III.50.4), as discussed in the introduction to  the latter hymn. This section ends with a slighting mention of a rival and appar ently non-sacrificing group, whom Indra is urged to subjugate to Sudās and the  Bharatas.  
The next two verses (15–16) are the most mysterious in the hymn; they both  concern a female figure identified as sasarparī́, the formation and etymology of  which is unclear and which may either be a proper name or an attributive charac terizing adjective. (Our translation, “the squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī,”  is a portmanteau containing both adjectives evoked by the phonology and mor phology of the word and the proper name; we consider it a multiple semi-pun.)  The Anukramaṇī assigns these two verses to Vāc [=“speech”] Sasarparī, and some  scholars consider that the figure the embodiment of the Kuśikas’ verbal art. In any  case she seems to be responsible for the fame of the people she aids.  
The next four verses (17–20) appear to have no connection with the rest of the  hymn. They are prayers to deflect various possible catastrophes that might befall a  team of oxen and the vehicle they pull on a journey, and wish for safe return. This  section reads as if it were a continuation of or expansion on the Zauberspruch at  the end of III.33 against potential difficulties afflicting a team and its wagon at  a ford.  
The final four verses (21–24) are very difficult to interpret. They have tradition ally been taken as the expression of the implacable hostility between Viśvāmitra  and Vasiṣṭha, which is a staple of later texts (e.g., the Mahābhārata). But there  is no whiff of this personal hostility in the R̥gveda, in our opinion, and there is  certainly no mention of Vasiṣṭha, direct or indirect, in the verses here. There is,  however, hostility: verse 21 calls on Indra to help us defeat our enemy, and the next  few verses express in colorful images the impotence of the enemy’s actions and  weapons. The most puzzling verse is the final one, where the Bharatas, the people  

of Sudās, celebrated in verse 12, appear to be presented in an unflattering light. We  have no explanation for this.
