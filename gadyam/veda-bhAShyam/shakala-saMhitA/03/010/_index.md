Agni  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
9 verses: uṣṇih  
The hymn is in praise of Agni as he is kindled and installed as the Hotar in the rite.  Because the Hotar recites the hymns in the ritual and because this hymn emphasizes  Agni’s role as Hotar, the poet also connects ritual speech and Agni, in particular,  the speech that addresses him and that he can appreciate and inspire as the Hotar.  Again in accordance with Agni’s role as Hotar, the poet emphasizes Agni’s skill as  a priest and his ability to rectify any failures in the rite. In verse 7, which mentions  such failures, ví rājasi means both “shine in every direction” and “rule in every  direction.” Both, of course, would fit the context. Oldenberg suggests that this hymn (as well as the next two) may be organized  into tr̥cas. The extractions of triplets from these hymns in ritual performance and in  the Sāmaveda also speak in favor of tr̥cas, although not all tr̥cas in the later tradi tion correspond to tr̥cas in the original hymns. So, for example, as Oldenberg points  out, III.11.5, 7, 6 form a tr̥ca in the Sāmaveda, but they have a different order and  cross a tr̥ca boundary in the R̥gveda.
