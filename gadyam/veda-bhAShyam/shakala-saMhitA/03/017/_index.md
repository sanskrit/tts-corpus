Agni  
Kata Vaiśvāmitra  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn invokes the present sacrificial fire, the present Agni, as the reappear ance of the ancient Hotar who performed the sacrifice. The hymn emphasizes  the centrality of Agni in the sacrifice by insistently using different derivatives of  √yaj “sacrifice” in four of its five verses: verse 1 has suyajñáḥ, yajáthāya; verse  2, ā́yajaḥ, yakṣi, yajñám; verse 3, yakṣi, yájamānāya; and verse 5, yájīyān, yajā.  Strikingly, verse 4 has no derivative of √yaj, but rather is the direct proclamation  of Agni’s becoming the intermediary between gods and mortals and the source  of life for both.  

Verse 1 contains a pun, since aktúbhiḥ can mean both “with unguents” and “through  the nights.” Verse 3 is also complicated because the key word, ājā́nī, is a R̥gvedic hapax.  It could mean “birth” and uṣásaḥ could be genitive singular, which could yield either  “your three births belong to Dawn” or, less likely, “three are the births of Dawn.” Or  ājā́nī could mean “birth-giver” or “birth” and uṣásaḥ could be nominative plural, giv  
ing “the three dawns are your births or birth-givers.” As Geldner points out, in favor  of “three dawns” is the fact that three dawns also appear in VIII.41.3. In none of the  possibilities is the interpretation of the half-verse transparent. In the last verse, how ever, there is a direct reference to the Agni of the past and the Agni of the present, so  perhaps verse 3 refers to Agnis of the past, present, and future.
