Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn begins (vss. 1–3) with a charming image of poetic thought as a lovely  young woman, beautifully arrayed, seeking Indra as her husband and giving birth  to twins, who perhaps are two types of ritual speech. The subject changes in verse  4, moving to the mythic past and one of Indra’s great deeds: opening the Vala cave524 III.39  
and releasing the cows (of dawn) and by extension the sun (vss. 4–6). The implicit  connection between the verses concerning poetic speech and those treating the Vala  myth is not expressed, but would be well known to the audience: Indra and his help ers the Aṅgirases (here under the names Navagvas and Daśagvas “nine-cowed” and  “ten-cowed”) used the power of properly formulated speech to open the cave. This  is the mythic model for the poet’s use of ritual speech to secure light and safety for  the sacrificer and the sacrifice (vss. 7–8).

Indra Though nowhere near as obscure as the previous hymn, the first three vss. of this one also portray poetic craft and, especially, poetic inspiration.

Morphological parallelism and lexical repetitions dominate the rest of the hymn.
