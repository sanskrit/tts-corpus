Agni Vaiśvānara  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
15 verses: jagatī  
The first verse announces the two themes of this hymn: the establishment of the fire in  the sacrifice and its connection with the words recited by the priests. The poet begins  by announcing that the priests are creating the dhiṣáṇā, the “Holy Place” for the fire.  The meaning and etymology of dhiṣáṇā are not transparent, but it is synchronically  associated with the root √dhā “place, establish”—allowing the reference to the Holy Place of fire to be carried through this hymn by the frequent use of derivatives of  √dhā (vss. 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 15, echoed in vs. 6 when √dhā is used not to describe the  placement of fire but the establishment of wealth for the sacrificers). The placement  of fire is also connected to the words of the priests. The chanters “bring together”  Agni as their Hotar (vs. 1); gods originally gave rise to Agni through their “insights”  (vs. 3); and Agni flourishes “through our good thoughts” (vs. 12). The close con  
nection between the words of the sacrificial performers and the kindling of fire is  reflected in the poet’s description of Agni as a kaví, a sage poet (vss. 4, 7, 10). This hymn also explicitly describes or refers to the rites surrounding fire, some times connecting them with the character of the god Agni and often his role as  Vaiśvānara, the sun. In 4d, for example, the poet puns on rā́jantam, which can  describe Agni as both “ruling” (as it is translated there) and “shining” with his  heavenly flame as fire is kindled. In verse 9 the three kindling sticks may refer to the  three fires set to the west, south, and east that surround the sacrificial area, which  represents the earth. Thus Agni as the ritual fires around the sacrificial ground is  also Agni as the sun, which encircles the earth. And in verse 12, as Geldner rightly  remarks, the course of Agni is both the course of the sun and the paryagnikaraṇa,  the rite of carrying the fire around the sacrificial animal.  
At the end of the hymn, having set the fire in place, the poet turns to the Fire to  beg for easy travel, for the prizes of victory in the sacrificial contest, and for wealth.
