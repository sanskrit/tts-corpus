Agni  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
The address is to Agni as the fire kindled in the morning rites, whose appearance  anticipates that of the dawns and the sun. His advent inspires the recitations  of the priests and Agni himself grows stronger through those recitations and  through the rites, if Geldner has rightly identified “the many manifestations of  truth” in verse 2 as the acts of the sacrifice. The poet’s major theme, though, is  the identification of Agni with various deities whose functions intersect with  those of Agni. In verse 4 and briefly reprised toward the end of the hymn in  verse 9, Agni is Mitra, the god of alliances, because his kindling marks the  re-creation of the alliance between gods and mortals through the performance  of the sacrifice. Agni’s identification with the Adhvaryu, the priest in charge of  the action of the rite, follows from his role as Mitra. In 4d, however, the appella tive sense of mitrá “ally” comes to the fore, and Agni is not only part of the rite  and household, but the ally of the rivers and mountains, all the territories of the  earth. More unusually, in verse 4 he is also identified in his form as Jātavedas as  Varuṇa, the god of commandments. Neither Agni’s identification as Jātavedas  nor his authority to command are central to this hymn, so the introduction of  Varuṇa here is the result of Varuṇa’s close connection with Mitra, and Jātavedas,  although normally a name of Agni, is here semiautonomous from him, like  Tanūnapāt in the previous hymn.  
Verses 5 and 6, occupying the mysterious middle of the hymn, are the most  difficult. Verse 5ab might continue from 4d, proclaiming that the highest limits of  the earth and even the sky are governed by Agni. Alternatively, the “summit’s tip”  could be the reach of the sacrificial fire and the track of the bird could be the track  of the sun. In the latter case the verses connect two forms of Agni as the sacrificial fire and as the sun. In verse 6 Agni is identified with another deity, R̥bhu or the  R̥bhu, the craftsman, who, like Agni, is also a priest. The “hide of the grain” is  puzzling, but as also in IV.7.7, it might refer to the ritual grass and the “track of  the bird” again to Agni as the sun, appearing during the kindling of the morning  sacrificial fire.  
Verse 7 once more takes up the theme of the birth of Agni. His parents might be  Heaven and Earth, as Sāyaṇa and other interpreters suggest, or, more likely, the two  fire-churning sticks, which are Agni’s new parents with his every birth. Once Agni  is born, the plants—the kindling chips—nurture him and he becomes strong in the  lap of his parents. Then in verse 9 Agni, now flaring up, appears both in heaven as  the sun and in the sacrificial area, the navel of the earth, as the fire of the sacrifice.  The poem ends with one last identification: Agni is Mātariśvan, the fire-bringer, for  fire gives rise to fire.
