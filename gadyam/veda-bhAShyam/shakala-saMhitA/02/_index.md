### Sages  
The eponymous poet of Maṇḍala II, the first of the Family Books, is Gr̥tsamada,  who was the son of Śunahotra Āṅgirasa and the adopted son of Śunaka Bhārgava  according to Sāyaṇa and the Anukramaṇī. The hymns refer to the people of the poet  as Gr̥tsamadas four times, but also as Śunahotras three times. Of the forty-three  hymns in this maṇḍala, the Anukramaṇī ascribes all but seven to Gr̥tsamada himself. It attributes II.4–7 to Somāhuti Bhārgava, who would have thus belonged  to the lineage of Gr̥tsamada’s father by adoption, and II.27–29 either to Kūrma  Gārtsamada or to Gr̥tsamada. One of the characteristic features of the hymns of  this maṇḍala is that twenty-one of its hymns, almost half, end with the signature  refrain of the Gr̥tsamadas, “May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.”  

### Gods  
The maṇḍala has ten hymns in the Agni series, including one Āprī hymn  (II.3), and twelve in the Indra series (II.11–22). Among the latter is one of the  best-known Indra hymns, II.12, with its famous refrain, “he, o peoples, is Indra.” +++(5)+++ Characteristically, Gr̥tsamada connects the heroic deeds of Indra to the acts of the  ritual, so that the ritual practice becomes the guarantee that Indra will again perform his great deeds. Following the Indra series are four hymns to Brahmaṇaspati  or Br̥haspati, the “lord of the sacred formulation” (II.23–26). In the first of these,  Brahmaṇaspati or Br̥haspati appears as both a priestly companion of Indra and as  Indra himself in his role as a priest-king, and in the second, Br̥haspati is Indra. Both  refer to the Vala myth, in which Indra and his accompanying priests release the cattle by the power of the formulated truth. After two hymns, one to the Ādityas (II.27)  and one to Varuṇa, the foremost of the Ādityas (II.28), there are a series of hymns  to the All Gods (II.29, 31) or to various gods (II.30, 32). The last of these is a composite hymn in two different meters, honoring minor deities, including four female  deities concerned with childbirth. Most of the remaining hymns of the maṇḍala  are single hymns to other deities.  
 
Noteworthy among them are II.33, one of only  three hymns in the R̥gveda to Rudra, II.35, the only hymn in the R̥gveda dedicated  to Apām Napāt, the “Child of the Waters,” and II.38, a hymn to Savitar that shows  his role as the god of the evening who brings the world to rest. The final two hymns,  II.42 and 43, are hymns to omen-birds, asking them to cry only auspicious cries and  comparing their auspicious cries to the words and chants of the poets.
