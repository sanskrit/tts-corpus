Aśvins  
Gr̥tsamada  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
The poet of this hymn takes quite an original approach in matching every descrip tion of the Aśvins with a simile. He avoids the monotony that might otherwise  result both by the cleverness of his similes and by the occasional pun, in which  a descriptive word fits the object in the simile in one meaning but the target, the  Aśvins, in another. In verse 2, for example, jáneṣu “in the presence of the people” or  “peoples” refers to witnesses at a wedding in the simile, but in the target phrase they  are the tribes who perceive the united resolve of the Aśvins. Or again, in verse 7a,  within the simile the word śaktí probably refers to a “spear,” but in the target it is the  “power” of the Aśvins. In 7b, the rájāṃsi are all the spaces gathered between heaven  and earth in the simile, but regions given by the Aśvins, through which the poet and  his people can wander, in the target phrase. In verse 1, jarethe, here translated “you  awaken,” could equally well mean “you sing,” especially since the pressing stones  elsewhere are said to “sing.”  
Another feature of the hymn is that the poet often describes the Aśvins as vari ously beneficial for one’s tanū́, one’s “body” or simply “oneself.” Normally we might  take the word as a reflexive, but the poet compares the Aśvins to various limbs and  makes direct reference to bodies, so we have kept the stronger reference to the body  in the translation.  
In verse 7—the last verse of the poem proper since verse 8 is a signature verse  standing outside it—there is a final simile. This is the only one in which the object is  not in the dual and not compared to the Aśvins. Rather the object, an axe, is in the  singular and compared to “these songs” chanted for the Aśvins. This twist at the  end thus breaks the pattern of the hymn and marks its conclusion.
