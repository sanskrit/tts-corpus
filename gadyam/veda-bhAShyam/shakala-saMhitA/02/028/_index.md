Varuṇa Gr̥tsamada or Kūrma Gārtsamada  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
This is the only hymn to Varuṇa alone in Maṇḍala II, but it resembles the famous  Varuṇa hymns of book VII (86–89), especially in its confessional tone and its plea  to escape punishment from the god. The ellipses in the first verse point to Varuṇa’s  double role in this hymn. “This belonging to the Āditya sage poet” is in the first  instance the hymn itself that is being recited for the god. The poet hopes that  his hymn will dominate all things, or, perhaps better, be dominant over all other  hymns. At the same time, “this” is also the god’s own commandment, which the  poet describes in the hymn and which dominates everything in the world. Varuṇa’s  function as a speaker is underscored by the description of him as a kaví “sage poet”  since a kaví is one who knows and who speaks, and as mandrá “pleasing,” which  frequently characterizes the Hotar priest, who recites the hymns. Verse 2 carries for ward the argument, mentioning both the commandment of the god and the insights  of the poet. The poet calls upon Varuṇa to keep him safe from various threats (vss.  3, 6, 10), interspersing his petition with pleas not to fall victim to the punishment  from the god for his misdeeds (vss. 5, 7, 9). Toward the end of the hymn, the poet  once again calls attention both to his own speech and also to the commandment  spoken by the god (vs. 8), thus returning to the initial theme of the hymn.
