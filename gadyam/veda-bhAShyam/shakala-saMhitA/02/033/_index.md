Rudra  
Gr̥tsamada  
15 verses: triṣṭubh  
Although under his transferred epithet Śiva (“kindly one”), Rudra has a grand  career ahead of him in post-Vedic Hinduism, his role in Vedic, especially early  Vedic, is relatively restrained. Only three complete R̥gvedic hymns are dedi cated to him (I.114 and VII.46, in addition to this one, as well as two hymns  conjointly dedicated to Rudra and Soma, I.43 and VI.74). He is known espe cially as the father of the Maruts, and he has a dual nature: on the one hand,  he is prone to anger and quick to dispatch his weapons, especially his arrows,  at those who enrage him; on the other, he is a provider of healing remedies and  of good luck.  
The major part of this hymn is devoted to begging the god Rudra for his indul gence and his healing powers, but it also nervously expresses the hope that his venge ful assaults will be directed elsewhere. The dual nature of Rudra as both healer and  avenger is thus on display, and his parentage of the Maruts begins the hymn (vs.  1) and is mentioned several times in the course of it.

Rudra This is a much anthologized hymn, fully translated by Macdonell in VRS, Doniger, and Maurer. Its popularity is not surprising: it’s lively and varied, but does not pose major difficulties, though it has its share of small knots.

Renou EVP XV.157-60.
