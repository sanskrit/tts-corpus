Indra (1–5, 7, 8cd, 10), Indra and Soma (6), Sarasvatı̄ (8ab), Br̥haspati (9), Maruts (11) Gr̥tsamada  
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 11  
Despite the number and variety of divine dedicands in the Anukramaṇī ascrip tion reproduced above, this is essentially an All God hymn, dominated by Indra. It  appears between two All God hymns, although in its number of verses (eleven), it  is out of order, since both II.29 and II.31 have seven verses. There is no easy way to  adjust this discrepancy.  
The first part of the hymn (vss. 1–3) presents, however obliquely, the story of  the Indra–Vr̥tra battle, but it leads up to the battle with a timeless or contemporary  image. It describes the current daily rushing of waters (waters implicitly identified,  as commonly, with the dawns), and then asks when the waters first began to surge.  The unexpressed answer is—only when they were released after Indra’s defeat of  Vr̥tra. Verse 2 has been interpreted in multiple ways, and many difficulties remain.  Interestingly, it contains the first and almost the only example of a conditional verb  in Vedic, and the isolation of this grammatical form makes the interpretation of the  verse more difficult. In the tentative interpretation given here, the verse concerns an  unidentified figure (possibly Sūrya, who is sometimes an opponent of Indra), who  was planning to give aid to Vr̥tra in the battle (pāda a), but (pāda b) his plan was  detected and announced by an unidentified female figure (possibly Earth, possibly  Indra’s mother) to yet another unidentified figure (possibly Indra), thus foiling the  plan. The verse pivots in pāda c, which can have reference both to the mythological  past—the free flowing of the waters after their release on the killing of Vr̥tra and  their creation of paths for Indra—and to the timeless daily round—the continual  (re-)creation of paths for the sun by the dawns, since the formula in 2c is also some times used exactly of this situation. Thus the second half of verse 2 returns us to the  timeless daily realm of verse 1 and the double interpretation of waters and dawns.  The third and last verse about the Vr̥tra battle (vs. 3) is much more straightforward,  and may have been designed to resolve for the audience what the topic of the first  two, obscurely phrased, verses was.  
The rest of the hymn begs the gods, particularly Indra but, as the hymn pro gresses, other gods, to use the same powers that led to victory in the Vr̥tra battle to  combat the poet’s enemies. The importance of sacrifice in winning the gods’ favor  is emphasized in verses 6–7.  
The hymn contains some striking expressions, for instance the “night” of the  waters in verse 1: the image evoked may be a naturalistic one, that waters in full  flow can appear dark, but with the identification waters = dawns the image can  also describe the progress from night/darkness to dawn. Note also that the phrase  “every day” defines the hymn as a ring composition, though it has different lexical realizations in verse 1 (áhar-ahar) and as the last word of the last verse 11  (divé-dive).

Indra and other divinities This hymn has at least three, possibly four modern ling. features: conditional (ábhariṣyat vs. 2), future impv (kṛṇutāt vs. 5 [though the fut. impv. appears to be inherited, it is fairly rare in the RV and generally seems to belong to a more colloquial speech level]), gerund (abhikhyā́ya, hatvī́vss. 9, 10), and mid. subj. in -ai (naśāmahai vs. 11).
