Indra  
Gr̥tsamada  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn centers on Indra’s chariot, which, the poet hopes, will carry Indra to his  sacrifice and not to the sacrifice of any of his rivals (vss. 3, 7). Indra’s chariot is also  the sacrifice itself. According to Sāyaṇa, its four yokes are the four soma-pressing  stones; the three whips are the three pitches used in recitation; the seven reins are  the seven meters; and—the least likely of Sāyaṇa’s identifications—the ten oars are  the ten planets “that rescue from evil beings” (etymologizing arítra “oar” as ari “enemy” + trā “rescue”) or the ten Camasādhvaryus. In a lengthy note Witzel and  Gotō suggest other possibilities for such numbers. With regard to the world, three  may be the three worlds or the three positions of the sun, four the four directions,  seven the seven rivers, and so on. In relation to the sacrifice, three might be the  three sacrificial fires or the three soma cups, four (or four times four) the number  of priests, seven the three (fires, cups) plus the four (priests) or the seven priests  mentioned in II.5.2, ten the seven (priests) plus the three (fires, cups) or ten fingers,  ten fires, ten soma vessels, et cetera. All that said, however, the specific identifica tions are less important than the possibility of finding many identifications and the  generally increasing numbers (4, 3, 7, 10). These project a picture of the chariot as  encompassing all aspects of the sacrifice and of the world.  
Verse 2 begins with another enumeration. Here the first, second, and third might  be the three soma offerings of the sacrificial day or the three fires of the sacrificial  ground. The second half of verse 2 turns to a key moment in the sacrifice, the birth  of Agni out of the fire-kindling stick. The newly born Agni keeps company with  “the others,” but once again who or what these others are is unclear: they might be  the sacrificial fires, the sacrificial offerings, the gods, or even other priests. From  verse 3 the poet’s attention turns especially to Indra’s chariot-horses, whose number  progressively increases from two (vss. 3, 4)  to a hundred (vs. 6). This increasing  number suggests that these horses might correspond to an aspect of the sacrifice  that carries Indra to the sacrificial area. For the poet there are few greater attrac tions for Indra than the ritual recitations, and therefore these horses may be the  words of these recitations, which like these horses multiply as the hymn is recited.  Note that śaténa “with a hundred” is the hundredth word of the hymn. Once again,  however, the multiplication of horses is also an indication of the fluidity of this  hymn’s numerology and another signal that Indra’s chariot comprehends the whole  of the sacrifice and the world.
