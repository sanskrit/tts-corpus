Indra  
Gr̥tsamada  
9 verses: triṣṭubh, except virāḍrūpā 3  
This hymn contains a number of metrical peculiarities: verses 2c, 8b, and possibly  6d are one syllable short. On the other hand, the name “Indra”—and the poet  draws attention to the name in verse 6—is clearly disyllabic only in the first and in  the final verse. Everywhere else, a trisyllabic pronunciation will restore the meter.  Again, the poet emphasizes this since in verses 2a, 3a, and 4a the vocative indra,  nominative índraḥ, and accusative índram, all in the same metrical position, can be  recited trisyllabically. There is also a double sandhi contraction in verse 2b, where  abhiṣṭipā́ḥ asi* > abhiṣṭipā́si. Verse 2b contains a śleṣa, in which the same word can  function in two different roles, since tvā́vataḥ “such as you” can be both a genitive  singular with “good favor” and an accusative plural modifying “men.” Verse 2a  has ūtī́ for ūtíbhiḥ. None of these forms is unprecedented in the R̥gveda, but the  persistent and deliberate use of such semi-irregularities suggests that the poet has a  particular purpose in employing them. Perhaps he wished to call special attention  to the inspired thinking and insight (vss. 1, 2), the praises and lauds (vss. 3, 4, 5,  7), and the poetic formulations (vss. 4, 5) of the poet by using words that would in  some way call attention to themselves. It is these words that Indra “makes power ful” (vss. 5, 7).  
The hymn ends by contrasting the poets and their people, whom Indra helps,  to the Dāsas and Dasyus, whom he defeats. Again, there may be a suggestion that  what differentiates the fates of the poets and their enemies is precisely the mastery  that the former have over words.  
The mythical references in 5cd are obscure, but they may have something to do  with the conquest of darkness by light. If so, then they anticipate Indra’s victory  over the Dāsa fortresses “with their dark wombs” (vs. 7).
