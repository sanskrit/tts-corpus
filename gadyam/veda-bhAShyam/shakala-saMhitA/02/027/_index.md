Ādityas  
Grtsamada or K ̥ ūrma Gārtsamada  
17 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first part of the hymn (vss. 1–7) calls on the Ādityas for protection against  all sorts of dangers encountered during journeys to settlements and between  settlements. They have the power to protect because they are gods who govern  the world and the heavens according to the truth, which defines the order and  nature of things as they are and ought to be (vss. 8–10). The poet then returns  once more to the theme of a journey protected by the Ādityas and looks forward  to his finding a place to settle, a place of good pasturage (vs. 13) and a place  that is open and secure (vs. 14). The poet insists that he is worthy of the Ādityas’  protection: like the gods themselves (vss. 2, 9), he is śúci “gleaming, pure” (vs.  13), free of any taint. And if he has committed any offense, he begs the Ādityas’  mercy (vs. 14)  and hopes that he would never fall to the punishments of the  Ādityas (vs. 16). The meaning of verse 15cd is not quite clear. The two dwelling  places mentioned there could be heaven and earth, to which pādas ab refer, or  possibly, as Geldner suggests, to opposing sides from whose conflict the poet  hopes to benefit.
