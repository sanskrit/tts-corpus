' अस्माकम् ' इति सप्तर्चं नवमं सूक्तं गृत्समदस्यार्षं वैश्वदेवम् । अन्त्या त्रिष्टुप् शिष्टा जगत्यः । तथा चानुक्रान्तम्-' अस्माकं सप्त वैश्वदेवं त्रिष्टुबन्तम् ' इति । विनियोगो लैङ्गिकः ।।

7 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7  
The common identification of the sacrifice, and particularly the praise hymn at the  sacrifice, with a chariot in a race is the backgrounded theme of this hymn, which  becomes foregrounded in the final verse. The controlling chariot image in turn gives  rise to other comparisons, as when in verse 1 charioteers sitting on the wooden  chariot are compared with birds sitting in trees.  
The word “those seeking fame” (śravasyávaḥ) defines the hymn as a ring compo sition, as it occurs in both the initial and final verses, and the middle verses, 3–5, all  open with utá syá [/tyá] “and this,” a cluster that marks a simple omphalos. Though  most of the hymn is relatively straightforward, the end of the final omphalos verse,  5d, is difficult and has elicited several different interpretations.  
The designation “all gods” as the dedicand of the hymn is quite accurate: a wide  variety of gods and divinized powers are addressed in the hymn and begged for help.

All Gods Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) follows Windisch (Fs. Roth) in seeing this hymn as an allegory, with rátha- ‘chariot’ = stóma- ‘praise’ and the solution provided only in the last vs. I find this interpr. overblown. The equation of the hymn / sacrifice with a chariot is a trite trope in the RV; I don’t see that this hymn treats the theme in a special way, but perhaps I’m missing something.
