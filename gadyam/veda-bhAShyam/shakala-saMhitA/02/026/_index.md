' ऋजुः ' इति चतुर्ऋचं चतुर्थं सूक्तं गृत्समदस्यार्षं जागतं ब्राह्मणस्पत्यम् । तथा चानुक्रान्तम्- ' ऋजुश्चतुष्कम् ' इति । गतो विनियोगः ।।

26 (217)  
Brahmaṇaspati  
Gr̥tsamada  
4 verses: jagatī  
The subject of this hymn is very similar to that of the preceding (II.25)—the ways  in which a mortal favored by Brahmaṇaspati will prosper—and the same phrase  “he will win against those who seek to win” (vanavad vanuṣyatáḥ) found in the first  pāda of each hymn signals their relationship. However, II.26 lacks the refrain found  in II.25, and it also varies the 3rd-person description of the favored mortal with a  2nd-person address to the same mortal in verse 2. The series of abrupt imperatives  in that verse enlivens the hymn.  
Unlike II.25, where the importance of ritual activity is established in the first  half-verse but not mentioned again, this hymn constantly emphasizes the power  that the performance of the sacrifice gives to the sacrificer, in contrast to the impi ous man, who is weaker by nature, even if he is a good warrior.
