Agni  
Gr̥tsamada  
13 verses: jagatī  
The solar aspects of fire are emphasized, with a number of comparisons to and  identifications with the sun, some of which are obscure and enigmatic (e.g., vs.  4). The twin themes of the whole hymn are encapsulated in the first verse: Agni  installed in the ritual ground, performing the role of Hotar, and receiving oblations  and hymns; Agni as the earthly counterpart of the blazing sun.  
The hymn falls into two nearly equal parts. The first five verses are primarily  descriptive, with Agni generally referred to in the 3rd person; verses 6–12 (13 is  repeated from II.1.16) consist primarily of requests, addressed to Agni in the 2nd  person. The first half establishes Agni’s cosmic role, mediating between and watch  
ing over the heavenly and earthly realms and maintaining his position through the  regular temporal alternations (for the latter, see esp. vs. 2). With Agni’s cosmic dom inance thus affirmed, the second half seeks to utilize these wider powers of his to  enhance our own position in the cosmos. See, for example, verse 9, where the poet  describes his poetic vision (dhī́) taking its place among the immortals in heaven, and  verse 10, where he compares the brilliance of his own people with the sun, the same  sun with which Agni is identified earlier.  
There is also an emphasis on Agni perceiving and being perceived, enhanced  by a pun in the Sanskrit on the verb citaya, which can mean both “appear, be per ceived” and “perceive,” sometimes simultaneously (vss. 4, 5, 10).  
Stylistically the hymn seems designed deliberately to contrast with the preceding  one (II.1). In that hymn Agni is identified with various beings and elements, whereas  in this one, especially in the first half, Agni is compared to such third parties: the  simile is the dominant figure. It is striking that II.1, by contrast, contains not a  single simile.

Agni One curious feature of this hymn is that it is the home to the densest cluster of uṣás- occurrences in II (vss. 2, 7, 8); the word is otherwise pretty rare in this maṇḍala, and there are no Dawn hymns in it. The focus on Agni’s likeness to the sun probably accounts for this. This likeness is hinted at first in the adj. svàrṇara- ‘possessing solar glory’ in 1c. This adj. is echoed by three occurrences of the simile svàr ṇá “like the sun” (7d, 8b, 10d), where the simile particle ṇá (with close sandhi retroflexion as always after svàr), though having nothing to do with the -ṇa- in the adjective, reproduces it phonologically.

Another notable feature of the hymn is the fact that the stem citáya-, which occurs three times (4c, 5d, 10b), in all three cases must be read doubly, as ‘appear’ in one construction in the passage and as ‘perceive’ in another construction in the same passage.
