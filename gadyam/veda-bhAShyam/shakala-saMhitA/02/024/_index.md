Brhaspati ̥  
Gr̥tsamada  
16 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 12, 16  
As Schmidt (1968: 230–37) points out in his translation and extensive analysis of this  hymn, the poet frames his hymn with references to the Vala myth in verses 2–7 and  14. The poet does expand the scope of the myth, however, since the cave contains  not only cattle (vss. 3, 14), but also the sun (vss. 3, 9) and honey and water (vs. 4). In  verses 3 and 14 the cows likely refer also to the dawns. Inside of this frame, the poet  describes the present, in which Br̥haspati inspires the sacrificial hymns and receives  the sacrificial offerings. These present events are partly blended with mythical ones.  In verse 8, for example, the present hymns created by Br̥haspati are his arrows, but  this description of words as arrows recalls the ancient heroic deeds of Br̥haspati and  Indra. More explicitly, in verse 9cd Br̥haspati’s victory causes the sun to blaze, which  echoes the release of the dawns in the Vala myth. And in verse 10 both gods and  humans receive nourishment through the ritual offerings and the goods won by him.  
This blending of the mythic and the present may also occur in the opening verses  of the hymn. Where later verses refer to the present but echo the past, in verses 2–7  the overtly mythic events occasionally suggest present ritual acts. In verse 4 the cis tern “containing streams of honey,” which Br̥haspati opens and from which all living  beings drink, recalls the ritual cups with their soma-honey. Priests are the heroes of  the battle in verses 6 and 7, and again this recalls the present ritual action of priests.  Such double reference may contribute to the obscurity of the most difficult verse in  the hymn, verse 5. A number of interpreters, such as Witzel and Gotō, understand  pādas ab to mean that from ancient times “these beings,” either the waters or the  cattle, were destined to come forth, but for a long time the door was shut on them.  That is to say, the basic reference is to the Vala myth, as in its surrounding verses.  On one level, this interpretation is surely right: there likely is a reference to the Vala  myth. At the same time, the poet’s extraordinary obscurity suggests that he may have  more in mind, and indeed pāda a explicitly connects past and present. The verse may  suggest the idea that what has happened in the past happens again, and therefore the  action of Br̥haspati is again necessary to free the cattle or the waters.
