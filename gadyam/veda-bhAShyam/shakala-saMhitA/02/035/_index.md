Apām Napāt (Child of the Waters)  
Gr̥tsamada  
15 verses: triṣṭubh  
This is the only R̥gvedic hymn devoted to the divinity Apām Napāt “Child of the  Waters,” though he is mentioned on a number of occasions elsewhere in the text.  This divine name is also found identically in Avestan, but in the R̥gveda it is in the  course of becoming an epithet of Agni. In this hymn we see aspects both of the  identification with and assimilation to Agni and of the original independent divinity.  
After an opening (vss. 1–2) in which the poet in the 1st person offers his praise  to the divinity, the heart of the hymn (3–11) describes his birth, care, and feeding  by women, who at least in the early verses are the Waters, in sometimes enigmatic  phrasing.  
The fiery aspect of Apām Napāt is introduced gradually in the hymn, first by the  use of vocabulary regularly but not exclusively used elsewhere of Agni, for exam ple the “shining” words (vss. 3–4); as the hymn continues, vocabulary and imagery  point more and more strongly to fire, for example the twigs and plants in verse 8,  the emphasis on golden color in verses 9–10. But it is not until the second half of  verse 11 that unambiguous reference to physical fire is found (the verb “kindle” as  well as the identification of ghee as his food—though ghee first made its appear ance in verse 4). It is doubtless no accident that the first half of verse 11 announces  Apām Napāt as his “secret name”: this explicit reference confirms that the poem  heretofore has been framed as a riddle or enigma, for which “Apām Napāt” is the  solution. (Verse 13 also codes the same distinction between the originally separate  identities of Apām Napāt and Agni, by connecting the name Apām Napāt with “the  body of another,” namely Agni.)  
After the climactic verse 11, the hymn then takes a more ritual turn, and the  1st-person ritualist of verse 1 returns in verse 12. In this ritualistic section, the para dox of Apām Napāt being nurtured by the waters and his double, Agni, being nur tured by the fire-tenders is resolved (or the images are superimposed) by having the  waters bring ghee to him.
