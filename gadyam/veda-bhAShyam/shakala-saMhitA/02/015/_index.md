Indra  
Gr̥tsamada  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
As the hymn announces at the beginning, this is a proclamation of Indra’s great  deeds, a fact that is underlined in the refrain, “Indra did these things.” With some  exceptions, the deeds are straightforwardly described. In verse 5, as Geldner  remarks, the reference is to the story of Turvaśa and Yadu and that of Turvīti  and Vayya, whom Indra rescued from the waters. They were “non-bathers”  because they could not swim through the roaring waters, but Indra held back the  strong currents so that they could cross. The story in verse 6a that Indra made  the síndhu, the Indus (or perhaps simply “the river”), flow backward is otherwise  unknown. The story that Indra fought and defeated Dawn in 6c is mentioned  elsewhere (cf. esp. IV.30.8–11), but it is unclear who the “unswift” males and  “swift” females in 6c might be and why they are described as “hewn apart.” In  verse 7, as in II.13.12, the verse may conceal Indra’s ritual act of bringing forth  the soma. In support of this interpretation are the echoes of ritual acts also in  

preceding verses, such as the references to the ritual seats and possibly the laying  out of the ritual ground (in vs. 3) and bathing (in vs. 5). Or verse 7 may allude  to Indra’s cosmogonic acts. Verse 8 refers to the Vala story, in which Indra splits  the cave and freed the cattle for the Aṅgirases. In 9c, the description of an elderly  man (cf. VIII.45.20) or infirm man who finds riches despite his ailments may  simply underline Dabhīti’s unexpected success.
