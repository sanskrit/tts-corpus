Indra  
Gr̥tsamada  
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8–9  
This hymn encourages Indra to show the power that he showed at the beginning— both his beginning and the beginning of the world. There are several references to  Indra’s youth: the time when he received his mace from his father, Tvaṣṭar (vs. 6),  and when he obtained his first nurture (vs. 2). The first nurture may refer to the first  soma offering in the rite and also to the first soma Indra ever drank. His origins are  also the origins of the world, and the hymn catalogues his great, creative deeds: he  established heaven and earth and settled the mountains (vs. 5), he opened the cave  to release the cattle (vs. 1), he defeated Vr̥tra (vs. 6), and he sent the waters flow  
ing (vss. 3, 5). The poet calls upon Indra to give sustenance to him just as he has  received sustenance (vss. 7, 8) and to give to him a measure of wealth just as Indra  showed the measure of his power in creating the world (vs. 7).  
Striking is pāda 6b, which says that Tvaṣṭar made Indra’s mace “from every  race,” meaning from both gods and mortals, and “out of his knowledge,” per haps his knowledge of all creatures (cf. IV.42.3, cited by Geldner although to  make a different point) or alternatively, “out of their possessions.” That is to  say, the weapon by which Indra performs his great deeds draws on the totality  of humans and gods for its power. Oldenberg observed that the juxtaposition  of the words janúṣo védas (“race. . . knowledge [/possession]”) recalls the epithet Jātavedas, which describes Agni as the continuous presence throughout the sacri ficial day and the guarantor of the continuity of the human lineage. Perhaps this  constitutes an oblique reference to the totality of gods and mortals that becomes  Indra’s weapon.
