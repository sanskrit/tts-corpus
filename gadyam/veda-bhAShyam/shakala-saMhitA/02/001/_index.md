Agni  
Gr̥tsamada Bhārgava Śaunaka, originally Āṅgirasa Śaunahotra  
16 verses: jagatī  
This hymn is structured as a series of identifications—of the god Agni with priests,  other gods, kin/social relations, qualities, body parts, and so on, with the identifica tion mediated by the quality held in common.  
Although the equations may at first seem randomly ordered, in fact they fol low a logical progression. The first ones (vs. 2) identify Agni with human priests.  (Priestly identifications are also found extensively in II.5. And for the relationship  between particular priests and particular gods, see also the R̥tugraha hymns I.15,  II.36–37.) In the next five verses (3–7) the variety of functions Agni discharges  invite identification with a series of gods. Verses 8–9 then set Agni in the web of  human relationships, of varying degrees of close kinship. We return to the divine (or  semi-divine) world in verses 10–11, but the identifications here link him especially  to ritual activity (the R̥bhus in vs. 10, who are associated with the Third Pressing  and who achieved divinity by their ritual feats; the female divinities in vs. 11, who  are regularly mentioned in the Āprī hymns) and prepare for the last section of the  hymn (vss. 12–14). The R̥bhu verse (10) also contains an elaborate pun, while the  identification of Agni with three female divinities in verse 11 would surely provoke  attention in the audience. Agni’s own ritual service, especially to the gods, provides  the subject of verses 12–14. The last pāda of this last section (14d) provides a ring  with the first verse (1d): “you were born blazing” (jajñiṣe śúciḥ 14d), reprising “you  are born blazing” (jāyase śúciḥ 1d), in both cases with a mention of the plants as his  source. This neat ring, which closes the series of individual identifications, sets the  stage for the climactic verse 15 (before the refrain of 16), which proclaims Agni’s  complete superiority throughout heaven and earth.  
The identifications are themselves structured by an extraordinary density of rhe torical repetition. Of the sixteen verses, the first fourteen begin with a form of the  2nd-person singular pronoun tvám “you,” followed by the vocative agne “o Agni.”  In fact fifty-four pādas out of fifty-six open with a 2nd-person singular pronoun,  in addition to other pronominal forms scattered in non-initial position. For exam ple, there are seven forms of tvám in the first verse alone. The fifteenth verse (and  the last before the refrain) begins, as usual, with tvám, but the vocative ágne is  postponed till the opening of the second pāda—distracting the formula. As often,  rhetorical patterns established earlier in a hymn are varied as the hymn comes to  a close, and the change of pattern here draws attention to the climactic contents  of verse 15 discussed just above. Though the rhetorical tool, repetition, is a blunt  instrument, its effects are powerful.  
This rhetorical pattern is especially striking because so many of the pronominal  forms are nominatives and therefore unnecessary, since pronominal subjects need  not be expressed in Sanskrit. Though some of these nominatives occur in equational sentences (cf. tvám agníd r̥tāyatáḥ “you [are] the Agnidh of the one who follows  truth”) where a pronominal forms is often used in place of a copula, a surprising  number of these equational sentences also employ a 2nd-person singular copula (asi [e.g., 3a, 5d] or equivalent), rendering a pronominal subject unnecessary. For further  
discussion see Jamison (2007: 59–60). Poetics, not grammar, is the driving factor. The effect of this incantatory repetition of “you, Agni,” taking place in front  of the sacrificial fire on the ritual ground, combined with the sweep of equations  identifying Agni with what comes to seem like everything on earth and in heaven,  is to concentrate all of the cosmos into this small space, the sacrifical ground, and  this single entity, the sacrificial fire—indeed making the sacrificial microcosm  the equivalent of the macrocosm. The ordering of the identifications—starting  and ending at the sacrifice, but in between ranging through both the divine and  human realms—models the centrality of the sacrifice and of its focus, the sacred  fire. It is a powerful beginning to the maṇḍala and to the Family Books in general.
