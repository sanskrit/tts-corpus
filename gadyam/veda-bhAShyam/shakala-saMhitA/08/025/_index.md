25 (645)  
Mitra and Varuṇa (1–9, 13–24) and the All Gods  (10–12)  
Viśvamanas Vaiyaśva  
24 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas ̥  
The only hymn in Maṇḍala VIII ostensibly devoted to Mitra and Varuṇa, it keeps  its focus on these two gods only during the first part of the hymn (vss. 1–9), which  celebrates them as sovereign kings possessing the truth. Starting in verse 10 other  gods join the group besought for help and protection. In particular the Sun, as a  representative of the Ādityas, is the main subject of two tr̥cas (vss. 16–21). The final  verses of the hymn (starting with vs. 19) turn their attention to the sacrificial setting.  A simile concerning the ritual fire in verse 19 serves as a transition to this scene,  and an address to the Sun in verse 21, which introduces the poet’s “benefactors,”  likewise produces a transition to the final tr̥ca (vss. 22–24), a dānastuti praising the  gift of several horses and a chariot.  
Although the thematic structure of the hymn roughly tracks the arrangement  in tr̥cas, the tr̥cas do not have strong internal cohesion, and there is relatively little  verbal unity within them.
