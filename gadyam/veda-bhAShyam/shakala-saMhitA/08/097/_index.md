Indra  
Rebha Kāśyapa  
15 verses:  br̥hatī 1–9, atijagatī 10, upariṣṭādbr̥hatī 11–12, atijagatī 13, triṣṭubh 14,  jagatī 15, arranged in trcas ̥  
Though metrically complex and metrically disturbed, this hymn follows a famil iar thematic pattern, with its contents structured by the tr̥ca division. In the first  tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) the poet asks Indra to take possession of wealth belonging to other  human lords, who do not follow proper ritual behavior, and to redistribute it to the  ritualists of the poet’s own group. The next tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), as often, calls on Indra to  come to the sacrifice from wherever he happens to be. The hope for Indra’s exclusive  company and the fear that he might not come at all are balanced in the third tr̥ca  (vss. 7–9). This tr̥ca has an unusual structure, with the first and last pādas of each  verse identical, a type of very tight ring-composition.  
Only in the following tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) does the poet turn to formal praise of the  god (though vs. 9 serves as a transition), but these verses function almost as much  as a praise of the praisers themselves. In verse 11 the mockingly designated “raspers”  (rebhá), that is, the singers, especially the poet himself, whom the Anukramaṇī iden  
tifies as Rebha, make Indra strong through their praise. More strikingly, in verse  12 the poets “bend the felly” of his chariot just by looking at it, and make Indra himself bow by their words; the point is surely that they thereby make Indra change  the course of his journey and come to the sacrifice. In verse 10 an unidentified  group both fashions and begets Indra; given the agents of the following verses, it  is very tempting to assume that Rebha intends us to understand that it is the poets  who fashioned and begot Indra (although the gods themselves, mentioned at the  end of the previous verse, could also be the subject). In the last tr̥ca the poet com  
bines praise of Indra’s immense power with pleas for him to use it for our benefit.
