'उपमं त्वा' इत्यष्टर्चं पञ्चमं सूक्तं काण्वस्य मेध्यस्यार्षम् । अनुक्रान्तं च-- 'उपमं त्वष्टौ मेध्यः' इति । अयुजां बृहती छन्दः । युजां सतोबृहती छन्दः । विनियोगः सूत्रादवगन्तव्यः ।।

Indra  
Medhya Kāṇva  
8 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas.  
A fairly conventional Indra hymn, which begins with a string of superlatives  applied to Indra and praise for his previous deeds (vss. 1–2) and then proceeds to  the invitation to the soma sacrifice (vss. 3–4). The poet asks Indra for the usual ben efits: wealth and aid, but he is especially concerned with winning in prize-contests  and battle raids. See especially verses 6–8.
