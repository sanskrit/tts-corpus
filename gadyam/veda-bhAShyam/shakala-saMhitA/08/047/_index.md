‘ महि वः' इत्यष्टादशर्चं पञ्चमं सूक्तमाप्त्यस्य त्रितस्यार्षम् । षडष्टका महापङ्क्तिश्छन्दः । आद्यास्त्रयोदशर्चं आदित्यदेवताकाः । यच्च गोषु' इत्याद्याः पञ्चर्चं उषोदेवताका आदित्यदेवताकाश्च । तथा चानुक्रमणिका-’ महि वो यूना त्रित आप्त्य आदित्येभ्योऽन्त्याः पञ्चोषसेऽपि महापाङ्क्तम्' इति । सूक्तविनियोगो लैङ्गिकः ॥

Ādityas  
Trita Āptya  
18 verses: mahāpaṅkti  
The first two-thirds of this hymn (through vs. 12) beg the Ādityas for general help  and protection from generic evils—the nonspecific nature of what is requested  underlined by the rather redundantly phrased refrain. The refrain continues through  the last third of the hymn (vss. 13–18), but in the non-refrain portions the focus nar  
rows—to the elimination of the “bad dream,” which is sent far away to the shadowy  figure called Trita Āptya. Nothing else in the scraps of mythology we know about  Trita Āptya explains why he should be the scapegoated recipient of our nightmares,  much less why he would make them into body ornaments (vs. 15) or use them as  food and work (vs. 16). The agent who removes the bad dream to Trita is Dawn (vss.  14–16, 18), whose participation is easier to understand—as anyone knows who has  experienced the relief of waking in the morning to discover that the nightmares just  experienced were not real.
