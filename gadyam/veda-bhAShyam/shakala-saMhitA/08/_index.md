### Sages and structure  
Maṇḍala VIII is organized into small groups of hymns attributed to a single poet  or a set of closely related poets. Within each group, the hymns are organized by  divinity and meter and length of hymn. 

As noted in the general introduction, two  poetic lineages predominate, that of the Kāṇvas, especially in the first two-thirds of  the maṇḍala, and that of the Āṅgirases in the last third, although the Anukramaṇī attributes some hymns to poets belonging to neither lineage and in addition Kāṇva  hymns appear in the Āṅgirasa section and vice versa. The Kāṇva/Āṅgirasa identification links Maṇḍala VIII with Maṇḍala I, where poets of these families are prominent. 

Inserted in the middle of the maṇḍala are the apocryphal or “half-apocryphal”  Vālakhilya hymns (VIII.49–59), appearing between the sixth and seventh anuvākas  of the maṇḍala. Although these were supplements to the R̥gveda collection, they  were transmitted with it and transmitted with accents, unlike the other khilāni, the  other appendices to the saṃhitā text. 

For further on the structure and affiliations of VIII, see especially Oldenberg (1888: 209–19) and Hopkins (1896). Many of the hymns in VIII are made up of strophes consisting of two or three  verses (pragāthas and tr̥cas respectively), in various meters. Quite long hymns can  be thus assembled, and there is often more coherence within the strophes than  between the strophes. These strophic structures were especially associated with the  sung portions of the ritual, whose principal priest in the classic śrauta ritual was  the Udgātar, the priest of the Sāmaveda, into which many of the verses of Maṇḍala  VIII were borrowed. Thus the VIIIth Maṇḍala seems to have a liturgical function  somewhat separate from the rest of the saṃhitā.  

### Gods  
Unlike the rigid divinity order in the Family Books, where Agni hymns always  precede Indra hymns, the ordering within the hymn groups is more various, with  Indra often leading off. Indeed Indra is the dominant god of the maṇḍala: of the  ninety-two non-Vālakhilya hymns, exactly half, forty-six, are dedicated to him alone,  with a further two to Indra and Agni jointly. Moreover, six of the eleven Vālakhilya  hymns are Indra’s, in addition to a joint Indra-Varuṇa hymn. Agni is, by contrast, rather muted in the book: only fourteen hymns belong to him alone. The  Aśvins are relatively well represented, with eleven hymns and parts of several others. The Ādityas also have a presence, with three hymns to them as a group, one to  Mitra and Varuṇa, and one to Varuṇa alone, as well as a substantial part of the composite hymns VIII.42 and 101 and of the All God hymns VIII.27 and 83. The  Maruts receive three hymns, Soma two (of the few Soma hymns outside of IX), but  the minor gods are almost invisible in this maṇḍala except in incidental mentions  in All God hymns.  

### Striking features  
There are many high points and striking features in this sprawling maṇḍala, of  which we can mention only a few. 

From a ritual point of view, VIII.31, which treats  the household pair, provides the only clear R̥gvedic mention of the Sacrificer’s Wife,  whom we consider a ritual innovation in late R̥gveda. Another likely sociocultural  innovation, the explicit organization of the three Ārya varṇas, the social classes of  brahmin, kṣatriya, and vaiśya, is obliquely referred to in the trio of hymns VIII.35– 37. 

On the mythological side, the story of Indra, Viṣṇu, and the Emuṣa boar, found  in later brāhmaṇa texts, is mentioned several times in this maṇḍala, with a fairly  coherent account of it given in VIII.77. 

Perhaps the single most striking hymn in  VIII is the Apālā sūkta, VIII.91, in which a barely pubescent girl conducts a private  soma sacrifice for Indra. A particularly beautifully structured hymn is the All God  riddle hymn, VIII.29. 

Finally, one of the most salient features of the maṇḍala is the  number of dānastutis, including some of the most notable in the R̥gveda.  

Although the first five hymns of VIII (VIII.1–5) are attributed to a variety of poets, as  Oldenberg discusses (1888: 214) they appear to belong together because of the similarity of the names of the poets assigned by the Anukramaṇī, the regular appearance  of a dānastuti, and the connection of the names of the Kaṇvas and Priyamedhas.
