Maruts  
Bindu Āṅgirasa or Pūtadakṣa Āṅgirasa  
12 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
This hymn, focused on soma-drinking, is a curious mix of almost vapid simplic ity and baffling obscurity. Although the Anukramaṇī assigns the whole hymn to  the Maruts, it has several features that deviate markedly from the general pattern  of Marut hymns. To begin with the clearest, the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) names a  number of gods as drinkers of the soma being presented: not only the Maruts (vs.  4), but the Aśvins (vs. 4), Indra (vs. 6), and the Ādityas, both as a body (vs. 4) and  separately (vs. 5). By contrast, in the remaining tr̥cas (vss. 7–9, 10–12) only the  Maruts are mentioned, but they are several times qualified by epithets and actions  that are ordinarily the province of other gods: for example, “having refined skill”  (vss. 7 and 10), generally used of one or more of the Ādityas; “mountain-dwell  
ing” (vs. 12), usually of Soma. Since the lexicon of Marut hymns is often tightly  limited, this borrowing of attributes is somewhat remarkable. Similarly the cos mogonic acts of spreading out the cosmic realms (vs. 9) and propping apart the  two world-halves (vs. 11) are Indra’s signature deeds, not otherwise attributed to  the Maruts.  
It is the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) that is the most problematic, however. It ends  (vs. 3c) exactly as the third tr̥ca ends (9c), and with a variant of the formula  found in all three verses of the final tr̥ca (vss. 10–12), in all cases inviting “the  Maruts to drink the soma.” But the hymn begins with a paradox (vs. 1), a cow  who herself sucks rather than giving suck, a cow identified as the mother of the  Maruts and also, in a sharply different animal metaphor, as the draft-horse of  their chariots. In the second verse this female figure seems to transform into, or  be identified with, Aditi: “the lap of Aditi” is a common phrase. It is this idiom  that gives some clue as to the intent of the first two verses. “The lap of Aditi”  seems elsewhere to refer to the ritual ground, or some part of it or some vessel  associated with it, and soma is prepared or deposited in this lap. The statement  that “the gods cause their commandments to be upheld” in this lap is a way  of saying that the ritual activities of mortals sacrificing to the gods keep the  cosmos functioning, so that, for example, the sun and the moon can be seen.  As for the first verse, Pr̥śni, the mother of the Maruts, is in a few mysterious  passages (notably IV.5.7, 10) also apparently identified with some part of the  ritual ground or equipment, and so Aditi (in “the lap of Aditi”) and Pr̥śni can  be superimposed on each other. If “the cow” of verse 1 is the ritual ground  (or some part thereof or piece thereon) as Pr̥śni, she “sucks” by receiving the  oblation, and she is the draft-horse of the Maruts’ chariots in providing the  occasion for their journey.  
The identification of the Maruts’ mother with Aditi in the first tr̥ca and the  ascription to them of epithets and activities characteristic of other gods in the rest of the hymn presumably stem from the same motive: to universalize the Maruts and  make them a species of All Gods.
