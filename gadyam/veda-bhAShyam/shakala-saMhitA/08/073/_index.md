Gopavana Ātreya or Saptavadhri Ātreya  
18 verses: gāyatrī arranged in trcas ̥  
Unified by its refrain, this hymn otherwise seems haphazardly structured, with  standard straightforward appeals to the Aśvins to come to our sacrifice (e.g., vss.  1–2) alternating with undeveloped questions and statements (e.g., 11–12) and,  more baffling, mythic allusions. The poorly understood story of the Aśvins’ res  
cue of Atri is mentioned in verses 3 and 7–8, their relation to Saptavadhri in verse  9, and an unnamed figure, sometimes identified by commentators as Saptavadhri,  is addressed in the final verses 17–18. The stories of Atri and Saptavadhri (who  are sometimes considered to be the same person) have often been discussed, and  radically incompatible plots have been reconstructed for them. See, for example,  Jamison (1991: 212–46) and, more recently, Houben (2010), who discusses previous  accounts. Houben emphatically rejects Jamison’s version, and his own has some  points in its favor but remains unconvincing in its entirety, at least to us.
