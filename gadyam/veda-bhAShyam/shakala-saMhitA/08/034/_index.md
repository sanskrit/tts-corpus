Indra  
Nīpātithi Kāṇva (1–15), the thousand rṣ̥ is of Vasurocis Āṅgirasa (16–18) 18 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–15, gāyatrī 16–18, arranged in trcas ̥  
The first fifteen verses of this hymn show a rigid formal structure that is awkward  to convey in translation. The second half of each verse consists of a refrain, which  implicitly contrasts with the first half of each verse. The refrain addresses an uniden tified plural “you,” who have driven to heaven and command heaven; we consider  the “you” to refer to the other gods, as contrasted with Indra, or perhaps specifi cally to the Maruts. Most of the first half-verses begin with the preverb ā́ “here”  and generally call upon Indra to drive here (using the same verb as in the refrain)  and participate in the sacrifice. Thus Indra’s desired presence “here” is the constant  counterweight to the removal of the other gods to heaven. The other part of the refrain is a curious vocative, clearly addressed to Indra,  divā-vasu “you who (bring) goods by day,” found only here and of odd formation.  The motivation for this form becomes clear in the dānastuti (vss. 16–18), where the  patron’s name is given as Vasu-rocis (vs. 16) “whose light is goods”: Indra’s epithet  divā-vasu is a pun on and a metathesis of this name, with the vásu “goods” element  reversed and rocís “light” replaced by dívā “by day.” The similarity between this  name and the relentlessly repeated epithet of Indra establishes an implicit identifi  
cation between the human patron and Indra; even more strikingly, verse 16 asserts  that the poet and the god Indra have jointly received rich goods from Vasurocis, so  that even Indra is presented as a beneficiary of the largesse of Vasurocis.  
The formal structure of the hymn continues to its very end: the final word of the  hymn is the signature ā́ “here,” which also began it.

Indra On the formal structure that dominates this hymn see the introduction. The hymn is awkward to translate and, I have to say, sometimes seems awkwardly composed.
