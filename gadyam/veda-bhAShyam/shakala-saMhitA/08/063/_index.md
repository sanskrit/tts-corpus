Indra (except the Gods 12)  
Pragātha Kāṇva  
12 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1, 4, 5, 7 and triṣṭubh 12, arranged in trcas. ̥  
Compared to the simple diction of the last hymn, this one seems deliberately  stiff and full of labored expressions whose decoding slows the pace of the hymn,  perhaps on purpose. The hymn’s structure, by contrast, is rather simple and  follows a straightforward trajectory, with each of the four tr̥cas expressing a  different theme.  
The hymn opens with a mysterious figure, the “tracker,” who is smeared or  anointed with mental constructs—intentions and insights—by two different  agents, who can be plausibly identified as the gods and Manu in his role as father  of mankind and the first sacrificer. This liminal figure, the tracker, is most likely  a ritual mediator between the divine and the human, and Agni makes the most  sense as the referent. The second verse confirms the ritual setting, and in the  third verse Indra makes his first appearance, in his role as opener of the Vala  cave. This mythological reference calls dawn to mind, and suggests the time of  the current sacrifice. Thus, the first tr̥ca establishes the scene as the Morning  Pressing.  
The second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) then calls Indra to that sacrifice; each verse contains  the word arká “chant.” In the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–10) various deeds of Indra are  celebrated, especially his defeat of enemies for the Five Peoples (vs. 7) and his  involvement, with Viṣṇu, in the killing of the Emuṣa boar (vs. 9), a myth which is  a specialty of this part of Maṇḍala VIII (VIII.69.14–15; 77.1–2, 6–8, 10–11; 96.2).  Here only the preliminaries, in which a rice porridge is fetched by Viṣṇu to nourish  Indra, are treated. The middle verse 8 mentions Indra’s manly deeds in general,  but also contains the phrase “you furthered the turning of the wheel” (cakrásya  

vartaním), which reminds us of the later designation cakra-vartin “turner of the  wheel” for a universal monarch. The last tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) introduces the Maruts  and finally the gods in general as associates of Indra and calls on all of them  for help.
