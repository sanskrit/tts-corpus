Indra and Varuṇa  
Suparṇa Kāṇva  
7 verses: jagatī  
This last Vālakhilya hymn presents a number of uncertainties in transmission, and  so it is difficult to know whether its sometimes awkward phrasing belonged to the  original poem or is the result of flawed transmission. In contrast, the hymn has a  rather tight structure, with an apparent omphalos: verses 3 and 5 have a number  of lexical correspondences, and in particular they both announce a truth (satyám).  These correspondences form a ring that defines verse 4, the central verse of the  hymn, as the omphalos, as well as containing the “truth” proclaimed in the adja  
cent verses. All three verses refer to a group, or groups, of seven in riddling fashion.  At least the female “seven” in verses 3 and 4—seven voices, seven sisters—can be  

identified as the soma-purifying waters, conceived of as the “seven rivers” of Vedic  mythology. (They are called “voices” because of the noise they make, just as one  of the words for “river,” nadī́, is derived from the root nad “roar,” an etymology  explicitly recognized by Vedic speakers.) The three heptads of verse 5 may refer to  the same streams, multiplied, or may evoke the number of gifts Indra and Varuṇa  should bestow in response.  
The omphalos verse is left incomplete: the poet urges the two gods to “estab lish...” (dhattam [if this is the correct reading, as we think]) but does not specify the  object desired. This truncated wish returns at the end of the hymn, however. The  final verse contains two occurrences of this same verb, with a plethora of objects.  This completion of the unfinished expression of verse 4 may be seen as another  example of “poetic repair” (Jamison 2006).  
Indra and Varuṇa do not form a natural pair, and it is not surprising that very  few hymns are dedicated to the two alone (I.17, IV.41–42, VI.68, VII.82–85, and a  tr̥ca in III.62 [1–3]). In the more prominent hymns to both divinities, especially the  justly celebrated IV.42, their contrastive qualities, especially their different types of  kingship, are highlighted. Here by contrast the two gods are essentially featureless  (the possible exception is 2cd), their only activities being to accept the soma offer  
ing and give prosperity to the sacrificers in return. In fact, vocabulary appropriate  to a more standard pair of gods, the Aśvins, is adapted here, especially the vocative  “you two lords of beauty” (śubhas patī), a common epithet otherwise confined to  the Aśvins.
