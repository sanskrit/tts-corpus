Save for VI.16 with its 48 verses, this is the longest hymn dedicated to Agni in  the R̥gveda, but unlike the composite VI.16, this hymn shows clear signs of unity.  This unity is evident (though more clearly in the Sanskrit) in the constant recy cling and recombination of vocabulary, especially the lexicon related to sacrifice.  Thematically the hymn focuses on Agni’s role in the sacrifice and on mortals’ tasks1064 VIII.19  
in helping him fulfill that role. Numerous verses promise the favor and aid of Agni  to the mortal who properly serves the fire (see, e.g., vss. 5–6, 9–14).  
This reciprocal relationship between the god Agni and mortal men and Agni’s  mediating position between gods and men provide other themes in the hymn. The  first verses (1–4) emphasize Agni’s divine nature even while sketching his role as  the Hotar parallel to mortal priests and chosen by them (esp. vs. 3ab), but this  equivocal position of Agni is explored differently later in the hymn. Verse 24 again  puts heavy emphasis on the fact that Agni is a god and immortal and also the  Hotar acting for and established by men, but here he seems to be acting almost  like a mortal himself—seeking the rewards of the sacrifice like a human priest.  This subtle role shift leads to a more explicit and otherwise unthinkable one in the  next verses (25–27), where the poet imagines himself as the god and Agni as his  mortal server and claims that he, the poet, would act beneficently. (For a similar  role reversal but with Indra and his mortal worshiper, see nearby VIII.14.) This  flight of fancy ends quickly, and the proper relations between man and god are  restored in verse 28.  
The hymn also has a political agenda, coming to a climax in verses 32–33, but  foreshadowed at various places earlier in the hymn. In verse 32 the poet announces  that he and his fellows have come to the fire belonging to the great king Trasadasyu,  the fire on which all other fires are dependent (vs. 33). As Proferes convincingly  argues (2007: 33–34 and passim), the fire represents the king’s sovereignty and is  depicted as being made up of the fires of the individual peoples who give allegiance  to the king, the brilliance belonging to each of these peoples being brought together  in a team. Agni is thus not only the mediator positioned between men and gods, but  also among different groups of men, and in both cases he is chosen for the role, put  in that position, by men acting voluntarily.  
The model of the sacrifice as reciprocal action and responsibility provides an  implicit model for the state. As noted above, earlier parts of the hymn hint at  what is to come. In verse 7 the poet hopes that his group can use their fires to  provide good fire for an unidentified plural “you”—quite possibly the larger pol  
ity. The plural “fires” is significant: though in ritual context it can easily be taken  as referring to the three fires on the ritual ground, in a political reading it can  represent the dependent fires of verse 33. The next verse (8) refers to Agni as “a  guest associated with alliance” (átithiḥ . . .mitríyaḥ). Again in ritual context this  refers to the god’s presence as guest in the house of a mortal and the alliance  between gods and men thus effected, but in a political reading the alliance is the  banding together of the peoples under Trasadasyu represented by Trasadasyu’s  fire. In verse 14 we find the curious and syntactically unusual expression “who will  piously offer boundlessness throughout the domains.” The word “boundlessness”  is áditi, usually used as the name of the goddess Aditi, mother of the Ādityas,  but more easily interpreted as a common noun here. Again, in a ritual context  it may mean that the ritual ground is equivalent to the whole world and thus  unbounded, but in a political context it may refer to the erasure of boundaries among the peoples who give allegiance to Trasadasyu and his fire. It may also  indirectly promise the favor of the Ādityas, the gods who oversee the relationships  among men, to the men who subscribe to this allegiance. The principal Ādityas,  Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman (as well as Bhaga), show up in verse 16, and already  Agni was said to be Mitraic (/associated with alliance) in verse 8 (see also vs.  25). It is surely significant that the two verses following the climactic declaration  about Trasadasyu’s sovereign fire (vss. 34–35) are dedicated to the Ādityas, specifi  
cally Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman. The final two verses (36–37) are a brief and  uncomplex dānastuti of Trasadasyu.  
It is hoped that this introduction gives some sense of the richness and intricate  interconnections of this hymn; much more could be said.
