‘आ नो विश्वासु' इति षड़ृचं दशमं सूक्तम् । नृमेधपुरुमेधावृषी । विषमसंख्याका बृहत्यः समसंख्याकाः सतोबृहत्यः । इन्द्रो देवता । तथा चानुक्रान्तम्-' आ नो विश्वासु षट्' इति । महाव्रते निष्केवल्ये बार्हततृचाशीतावेतत्सूक्तम् । सूत्र्यते हि पञ्चमारण्यके- ‘ आ नो विश्वासु हव्यो या इन्द्र भुज आभरः' (ऐ. आ. ५. २. ४) इति ॥

Indra  
Nr̥medha  Āṅgirasa and Purumedha Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas  
Indra as the powerful smiter of obstacles is called to our sacrifice and begged for  aid in battle and for riches. There is nothing particularly remarkable in this hymn  except for verse 5, where there appears to be an obscure reference to Varuṇa as  the “sustainer of domains,” who concedes various unopposable obstacles to Indra.  This epithet, carṣaṇī-dhŕ̥t, is actually more often used of Indra than of other gods,  but Varuṇa is also so called (IV.1.2, twice), and a telling passage, VII.85.3, describes  an amicable division of labor between Indra, who smashes unopposable obstacles,  and Varuṇa, who sustains the peoples, in almost identical phraseology to our verse  5. What then does “concede” mean in our passage? Most likely, in our view, that  Varuṇa concedes the sphere of warfare and martial defense to Indra, while con tinuing to perform his own task of assuring orderly existence in times and places  of peace.
