Indra  
Goṣūktin Kāṇvāyana and Aśvasūktin Kāṇvāyana  
15 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
This hymn begins with a pleasing playfulness: the poet teases Indra by declaring  that, if their places were switched, he (the poet as Indra) would be far more gener ous than Indra is now being (vss. 1–3), with the argument made in the next tr̥ca  (vss. 4–6; see also 10–12) that the strength Indra acquires from the sacrifice gives  him the power to be generous. Two tr̥cas in the hymn are devoted to Indra’s great  deeds: verses 7–9 to the splitting of the Vala cave and the supporting of the heavenly  realms, verses 13–15 to several different exploits, most notably the decapitation of  the demon Namuci (vs. 13). Though Namuci is mentioned several other times in the  text, this is the only place in the R̥gveda that refers to the later story of Indra’s trick  
ery directed against Namuci: pledging not to slay him with anything dry or wet, he  used seafoam as his weapon. (The earliest clear version of this tale is probably that  in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā IV.3.4, but it is recounted in several other Brāhmaṇa texts  and into epic and Classical Sanskrit. See M. Bloomfield [1893: 143–63]. For a pos  
sible indirect reference in the R̥gveda, see I.104.3.)  
The gāyatrī meter and tr̥ca structure, combined with the conversational tone of  the opening verses, give this hymn a light texture and informal style that contrast  nicely with the more ponderous Indra hymns in the early parts of Maṇḍala VIII.
