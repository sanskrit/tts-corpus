‘आ त्वा' इति नवर्चं द्वितीयं सूक्तमानुष्टुभमैन्द्रम् । तिरश्चीर्नामाङ्गिरस ऋषिः । तथा चानुक्रम्यते- ‘ आ त्वा नव तिरश्चीरानुष्टुभम्' इति । आभिप्लविकेषूक्थ्येषु तृतीयसवनेऽच्छावाकस्य  ‘ आ त्वा गिरः' इति तृचो वैकल्पिकोऽनुरूपः । सूत्र्यते हि -- गायन्ति त्वा गायत्रिण आ त्वा गिरो रथीरिव' (आश्व. श्रौ. ७. ८) इति ॥

Indra  
Tiraścī Āṅgirasa  
9 verses: anuṣṭubh, arranged in trcas ̥  
A simple hymn in which the poet, who names himself in verse 4, both urges Indra  to come to the soma sacrifice to enjoy the soma and the words of praise offered to  him and exhorts his fellow celebrants to redouble their praises. The most notable  feature of the hymn is the last tr̥ca (vss. 7–9), with its inescapable repetition of the  word śuddhá “cleansed, washed,” applied not merely to the soma but also to its ver  
bal accompaniments, as well as to Indra and the help he will bring. This verb is not  a standard part of soma vocabulary: it is used only once in Maṇḍala IX (IX.78.1),  where it refers to the washing of the soma plant before its pressing. The verb is in  general rare: almost all of its R̥gvedic attestations are found in the last three verses  of this hymn. In the few other occurrences where the nature of the action can be  determined, water is the agent, and it is clear that washing is the literal meaning of  the verb and the metaphor deployed in this hymn.
