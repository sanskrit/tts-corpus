Maruts  
Sobharī Kāṇva  
26 verses: kakubh alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas  
The typical Marut themes are deftly woven together in this hymn. After inviting  them to the sacrifice (vss. 1–2), the poet first describes the effects in nature of the  storm they embody (vss. 3–6) and then their flashy beauty and that of their chariot  (vss. 7–12), ending this section with two verses (13–14) on their lack of individuality  (see also vs. 21). The remainder of the hymn concerns the generosity of the Maruts  and begs them to display it in response to Sobhari’s hymn: the poet addresses him  
self in verses 19–20. Unlike the generic gifts generally asked for in R̥gvedic hymns,  the final verses make it clear that the poet has a specific request: Marut medicine to  heal the afflicted (vss. 23–26). Their association with healing comes through their  father Rudra.  
The hymn exhibits a light touch and has a number of neat turns of phrase—for  instance, verse 8, where “the music of the Sobharis is anointed with cows” indicates  that their hymn reaps a bovine reward from the patron, or verse 19, with its pun on  the participle cárkr̥ṣat meaning both “plowing” and “celebrating.”
