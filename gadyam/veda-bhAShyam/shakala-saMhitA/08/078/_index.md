Indra  
Kurusuti Kāṇva  
10 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas 1–9, br ̥ hat ̥ ī 10  
This hymn is all about greed. The first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) barely mentions the offerings  we make to Indra in the haste to list the things we want in return, down to the  earrings in verse 3. The last tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) praises both Indra and Soma for their  (potential) generosity, and verse 9 gives another list of desired gifts. Verse 10, in a  different meter, may be the most egregious of all: the poet, picking up the desire he  expressed for grain in verse 9, tells Indra he plans to do no labor for his grain, but  expects Indra to deliver it, not only grown but processed—preferably stacked, but  at least mown. So Indra is expected to serve as farmhand! This verse may indirectly  express the stockbreeder’s disdain for agriculture.  
The middle tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) contrasts somewhat with its surroundings. Though  the greed motif is found in verse 4, it is expressed in terms of Indra’s unique pow ers to increase wealth, to win goods, and to give them. The rhetorical pattern set  in this verse carries into the following verses, where the description of the god’s  powers becomes more general. However, the theme of the rest of the hymn is not  far from the surface, for Indra’s ability to see and to anticipate everything a mortal  might do would allow him to identify proper recipients and deny gifts to those who  behave badly.
