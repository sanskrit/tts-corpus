Indra  
Nārada Kāṇva  
33 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas ̥  
Though, like the previous hymn (VIII.12), this one is in uṣṇih meter and arranged  in tr̥cas, the tight structuring of VIII.12 is absent here, save in the final tr̥ca (vss.  31–33) with its four-syllable refrain and repeated identifications with the “bull,” and  most of the tr̥cas lack clear unity. The theme of growing and making strong found  in VIII.12 is continued here, however—notably in the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) and that  formed by verses 16–18, but also generally throughout the hymn. There are also less  insistent links between different parts of the hymn (e.g., the tree branches of vss. 6,  17), and some pleasing turns of phrase, like the “sea of the stalk” (vs. 15) referring  to a particular large vessel of soma.  
Mythological material is mostly lacking in the hymn, and what is found is given  perfunctory treatment (see the allusions to the Maruts in vss. 20 and 28–29). The  focus instead is the usual give-and-take of the ritual compact. Although the hymn  has no spectacularly memorable features, it does not seem to deserve Geldner’s  scornful dismissal as “ein recht nichtssagendes [‘trivial’ or ‘vacuous’] Lied.”1054 VIII.13

Indra Although the introduction. to the published translation is somewhat dismissive of this hymn and dubious about any unifying factors, closer examination shows a subsurface thematic unity esp. in the mid and later parts of the hymn, roughly vss. 16-30. For discussion see below.
