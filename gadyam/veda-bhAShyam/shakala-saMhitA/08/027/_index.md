All Gods  
Manu Vaivasvata  
22 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas  
This hymn to the All Gods falls roughly into three parts on the basis of the gods  addressed. The first eight verses contain a number of named gods, whose associa tions seem random, rather than ordered into the usual functional groups—with, for  example, the Maruts mentioned next to the Ādityas, singly or jointly, or to Agni.  In contrast to this jumble of divine names, the middle section (vss. 9–14) mentions  no gods except Savitar (vs. 12), and he is in service of the unnamed plural “you”  used of the gods as a corporate entity. The unity and superimposability of the vari ous gods in this section is made clear in verses 13–14. The final section (vss. 15–22)  mentions only the Ādityas, though in fact they appear only in verses 15, 17, and 22.  
Despite these differences in divine address, the hymn is unified by its concerns,  especially the desire for protection and shelter offered by the gods (see, e.g., vss. 4,  9, 20), and by its vocabulary—in particular the epithet viśvá-vedas “affording all  possessions” (vss. 2, 4, 11, 19, 20, 21) or, according to others, “having all knowledge,  which is a near phonological match to víśve devā́ḥ “All Gods,” to whom the hymn is  dedicated. The ritual context is also very much present in the hymn.  
On the basis of verse 12 and the sketch of Savitar’s functions there, Geldner  suggests that this is an evening hymn. But later in the hymn the poet insistently  mentions various times of day (vss. 19–21), and so it seems rather that he is seeking  the aid and protection of the gods round-the-clock, as it were.  

The language of the hymn is fairly simple and straightforward, and the lexicon  often repetitive. But the effect is pleasing, and the poem hardly deserves Renou’s  judgment (EVP IV: 106) that it is “banal” and “facile.”
