Maruts  
Punarvatsa Kāṇva  
36 verses: gāyatrī  
Although a tr̥ca division is possible for this hymn, it does not impose itself.  This is one of only three Marut hymns in VIII (with VIII.20 and VIII.94).  As with most Marut hymns, this one contains considerable description of the  effects on the cosmos of these embodiments of storm and of their journey  through the midspace:  the bowing of the mountains, the violent winds and  rain, the roaring. These descriptions are found primarily in the first part of the  hymn (e.g., vss. 2–5, 7–8) and toward the end (see esp. vs. 34, with its bowing  mountains forming a ring with vss. 2 and 5). The middle portion of the hymn  (approximately vss. 11–21) expresses our desires for their presence at our sac rifice and for their gifts, with the last two verses (20–21) posing anxious ques  
tions concerning the whereabouts of the Maruts and the loss of their attention.  This anxiety returns in two further question verses, 30–31, which preface the  Maruts’ final journey to the place of sacrifice, where they are praised together  with Agni (vss. 32–26).  
Verses 22–26 present various fragments of mythology; particularly striking, and  baffling, is verse 26 with its mention of the poet Uśanā and the “loins of the ox,”  which may be a glancing reference to the Vala cave.  
Like other long hymns in VIII the structure of this one is quite loose. However,  it does have at least a sketchy ring:  in addition to verses 2/5 and 34 mentioned  above, note the references to meter in the first and last verses (1 and 36). It is char acterized also by recycling of vocabulary, by rhetorical repetition (see, e.g., vss. 6,  9, 17, 22–24), and by frequent phonetic figures (a particularly nice one is found in  28ab:...pŕ̥ṣatī ráthe / práṣṭir...róhitaḥ).

Maruts As noted in the published introduction, this hymn contains dense repetitions of vocabulary and numerous phonetic echoes within and across verses. I have noted some, but by no means all, below. Particularly common in the earlier part of the hymn is the root √yā ‘drive’, in both verbal and nominal forms (2b, 4c [2x], 5a, 7b, 8b; also 14b, 23a, 26b, 28c, 29c).
