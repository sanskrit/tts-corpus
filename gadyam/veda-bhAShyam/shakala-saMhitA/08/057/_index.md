Aśvins  
Medhya Kāṇva  
4 verses: triṣṭubh  
This sequence of verses inviting the Aśvins to the soma sacrifice is unremarkable save  for a few features. The first verse explicitly establishes the context as the Third Pressing,  which, as we have discussed elsewhere, was probably a recent addition to R̥gvedic rit ual. And especially in verse 2 there are insoluble textual problems. Since the verse itself  is not terribly interesting in content, the difficulties can safely be left aside here.
