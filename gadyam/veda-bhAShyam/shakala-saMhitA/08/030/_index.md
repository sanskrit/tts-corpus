'नहि वः' इति चतुर्ऋचं दशमं सूक्तम् । आद्या गायत्री द्वितीया पुरउष्णिक् तृतीया बृहती चतुर्थ्यनुष्टुप् । मनुर्वैवस्वत ऋषिः । पूर्ववद्विश्वे देवा देवता । तथा चानुक्रान्तं- नहि वश्चतुष्कं पुरउष्णिग्बृहत्यनुष्टुबन्तम्' इति । विनियोगस्तु लिङ्गाद्वगन्तव्यः ॥

Manu Vaivasvata  
4 verses: gāyatrī 1, puraüṣṇih 2, br̥hatī 3, anuṣṭubh 4  
The final hymn in this Viśve Devāḥ series consists of four verses in four different  meters, though since they are all different combinations involving eight- and twelve syllable pādas, the difference in meters is not jarring. Much more jarring—and,  in our opinion, deliberately so—is the contrast between the slangy and popular  register in verse 1 and the solemn, almost stilted rhetoric of the second verse, which  explicitly represents itself as quoting the first one. The remaining two verses express  conventional prayers for aid and protection, in much the same style as verse 2.
