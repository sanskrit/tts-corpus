‘इमं नु मायिनम्' इति द्वादशर्चं सप्तमं सूक्तम् । कुरुसुतिर्नाम काण्व ऋषिः । गायत्री छन्दः । इन्द्रो देवता । तथा चानुक्रान्तम्- ‘ इमं नु द्वादश कुरुसुतिः काण्वः' इति । व्यूढे दशरात्रे चतुर्थेऽहनि मरुत्वतीय आद्यस्तृचः । सूत्रितं च--' इमं नु मायिनं हुवे त्यमु वः सत्रासाहम्' ( आश्व. श्रौ. ८. ८) इति ॥

Indra  
Kurusuti Kāṇva  
12 verses: gāyatrī arranged in trcas ̥  
A simple hymn that never strays far from its twin themes: Indra accompanied  by the Maruts and Indra drinking soma. The Maruts are mentioned as Indra’s  companions in each of the first nine verses, and the invitation to soma occu pies the middle six verses (4–9), while the Vr̥tra myth, glancingly alluded to,  occupies much of the first tr̥ca. Only the last tr̥ca lacks mention of the Maruts. The first verse of the last tr̥ca (10) appears to present the soma-drinking as  accomplished, and Indra’s role as Dasyu-smiter is celebrated in the next (11).  The final verse of the hymn (12) is a meta-verse describing the production of  the hymn itself. The numerological expression “eight-footed, nine-cornered” is,  as Oldenberg suggests (Noten ad loc.), a reference to the gāyatrī tr̥cas in which  this hymn is composed, with eight-syllable lines arranged into three verses of  three pādas each.  
Although the hymn is simple, it makes implicit reference to a complex ritual  development—that, in the course of the R̥gvedic period, the Midday Pressing, orig inally dedicated entirely to Indra, made room for the Maruts as joint recipients of  the soma with Indra. An important mythological treatment of this ritual innova tion is found in I.165 and related hymns. Here we see only the liturgical result, an  insistence on Indra Marutvant in a soma-drinking context.
