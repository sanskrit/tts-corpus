Agni  
Viśvamanas Vaiyaśva  
30 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas ̥  
The poet begins the hymn by urging himself to perform his sacrificial tasks (vss.  1–2ab), ending this little section with vocatives addressed to himself but seem ingly designed to identify himself with his divine target Agni: “belonging to all  domains” is often an epithet of Agni (as well as of Indra) and “having all in  mind” (viśvámanas) could be a divine descriptor. However, at least according to  the Anukramaṇī, it is the poet’s own name, and he then (vs. 2c) speaks in his own  1st-person voice. This interactive quality is prominent throughout the hymn. The  poet’s self-address returns in verse 24, and in between he also addresses in the 2nd person plural the assembled priests and worshipers, on whose behalf he is work ing (vss. 7–9; see esp. 9a, where he calls them “seekers of the truth”). (On poetic  self-address see Jamison 2009a.) Agni’s role in this social context, as clanlord of  

clans, is also emphasized (vss. 10, 13–14, 20). Manu, the mythical founder of the  larger Ārya sacrificial community known as the “descendants of Manu,” is also  duly remembered (vss. 13, 17, 25–26), as are the mythical seer Uśanā Kāvya (vs.  17) and the poet’s immediate ancestor, the seer Vyaśva (vss. 16, 23), whose devo  
tion to Agni and lucrative relationship with his patron, Ukṣan, merit mention and  provide a model for Vaiyaśva’s own gentle hint to his patron Varo Suṣāman (vs.  28). Thus the poet situates his praise of the god and his requests to him in a web of  social relations and mutual dependency pertaining both in the current time and in  the long history of the descendants of Manu.  
Both the praise and the requests follow the common tropes of the genre, though  often nicely executed. The focus is on Agni as the messenger of the gods and as  the carrier of our oblations to them. Some of the tr̥cas show thematic or syntactic  unity (e.g., vss. 13–15 against demons and cheats), but the tr̥ca structure is not  prominent, and there are bridges across tr̥cas (e.g., the messenger theme in vss.  18–19).
