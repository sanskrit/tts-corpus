Varuṇa  
Nābhāka Kāṇva  
10 verses: mahāpaṅkti  
A mystical hymn dedicated to Varuṇa alone, celebrating the god as cosmogonic  creator and shaper of the world—both spatially, by measuring out the primordial  cosmic domains and holding down and apart the cosmic realms (esp. vss. 4, 10), and  temporally, by regulating the nights and days (vss. 3, 10). The sun and moon as his  deputies function at the intersection of the spatial and temporal (vs. 9). The god is  also presented as holding both human and natural phenomena within his encom  
passing physical protection (vss. 1cd, 3ac, 4de, 7abc).  
The hymn seems to have a loose omphalos structure. Verbal correspondences in  verses 2/9 (especially the “seven”) and 3/8 (ní √dhā “deposit” and feminine plurals)  provide a weak ring (see also the “three” in vss. 3/9 and “embrace” [pári √svaj] and  “envelop” [pári √mr̥ś] 3/7). And the two middle verses, 5–6, the omphalos proper,  point to the hymn’s cryptic message—the creative power of poetry and of the  knowledge and control of words, especially names.  
Varuṇa’s later association with the waters is evident in several hints in the  hymn: his closeness to the rivers in 2d, who are also his seven sisters in 2e and the  seven over which he has control in 9e, and his identification as “a secret sea” in  8a. The waters may well be the referents of the unidentified feminine plurals in 7a  and 8c.  
Much remains unclear in this hymn, however, and we do not claim to have pen etrated all its many mysteries. One of the most obvious, but perhaps least interest ing, puzzles is the relevance of the jaunty and bloodthirsty Nābhāka refrain to the  high-minded and solemn contents of the hymn.
