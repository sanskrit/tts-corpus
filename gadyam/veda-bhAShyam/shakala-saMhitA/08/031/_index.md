Yajamāna + Patnı̄[Praise of Offering and Laud of  the Sacrificer 1–4; Household 5–9; Blessings for the Household  Pair 10–18]  
Manu Vaivasvata  
18 verses: gāyatrī 1–8, 10–13; anuṣṭubh 9, 14; paṅkti 15–18  
This last hymn of the small Manu Vaivasvata collection shows its composite nature  by its length, its mixture of meters, and, especially, by its themes. The first nine  verses contain two parallel treatments of the same subject; verses 10–14 seem  unconnected both with what precedes and what follows, and resemble some of the  disordered All God sequences in earlier Manu Vaivasvata hymns (VIII.27.1–8 and  VIII.28) in calling on an odd assortment of gods for protection; the final four verses  (15–18) return to the topic of the beginning of the hymn, the benefits accruing to  the punctilious sacrificer, though in rather general terms.  
The beginning of the hymn, especially verses 5–9, are of extraordinary rit ual interest, for they contain the only clear reference to the participation of the  Sacrificer’s Wife in R̥gvedic ritual—participation which is, in our view, a ritual  innovation in the late R̥gveda. (For indirect references to her presence in R̥gvedic  ritual, see Jamison 2011 and forthcoming a and b, and discussion ad VIII.33.) As  the Anukramaṇī states, verses 5–9 are dedicated to the “household pair” (dámpatī),  who are depicted as jointly participating in soma preparation (vs. 5). Their rewards  are great and appropriately domestic (see esp. vs. 8). Indeed, the mention of the  “milk-mixture” (āśír, vs. 5) makes it quite likely that the ritual depicted is the Third  Pressing, itself likely a ritual innovation, found only among certain R̥gvedic clans,  the pressing in which the participation of the Sacrificer’s Wife is particularly promi  
nent in later śrauta ritual (see Jamison 1996a: 126–46). The first four verses of the  hymn mention only the Sacrificer, with no mention of the Wife, but a reference to  the milk-mixture in verse 2 and to the benefits to his house (vs. 4) makes it likely  that these four verses treat the same topic, though without the radical overt mention  of the Wife.  

The Anukramaṇī considers the final four verses (15–18) to be blessings for the  same household pair (dampatyor āśiṣaḥ), but again there is no overt mention of the  Wife, and, in contrast to verses 1–4 with its reference to the milk-mixture, the ritual  that the successful sacrificer performed is left unclear.
