'एतत्ते' इति अष्टर्चं षष्ठं सूक्तं काण्वस्य मातरिश्वानस्यार्षमैन्द्रम् (मातरिश्वन आर्षमैन्द्रम् )। अनुक्रम्यते च- 'एतत्ते मातरिश्वा नो विश्व इति वैश्वदेवः प्रगाथः' इति । तृतीयाचतुर्थ्यौ विश्वेदेवदेवताके । अन्यासां षण्णामिन्द्रो देवता । अयुजां बृहती छन्दः युजां सतोबृहती छन्दः । विनियोगः सूत्रादवगन्तव्यः ॥

Indra (1–2, 5–8), All Gods (3–4)  
Mātariśvan Kāṇva  
8 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas  
Despite being technically twinned with VIII.53, this hymn has little in common  with its predecessor. However, verse 6 not only shares the concern for winning that  characterized the previous hymn, but also shares some of its phraseology: it begins  with a compound of ā́ji “contest” and two compounds with -pati “lord,” closely  paralleling VIII.53.6a, and much of the second half of the verse matches the second  half of VIII.53.7.  
The three pragāthas dedicated to Indra (vss. 1–2, 5–6, 7–8) are interrupted by  one to the All Gods, an elementary listing of various groups of gods (vs. 3) and  individual gods and natural forces (vs. 4). The verses to Indra beg him to display  his generosity.
