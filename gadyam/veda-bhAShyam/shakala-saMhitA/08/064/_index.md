Indra  
Pragātha Kāṇva  
12 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
A hymn artful in its extreme simplicity. Its diction, its syntax, and its structure  are all straightforward. It consists of four tr̥cas. The first (vss. 1–3) begs Indra for  gifts and aid against enemies and celebrates his preeminence. The second (vss. 4–6)  calls him to the sacrifice. The third (vss. 7–9) consists of rhetorical questions about  Indra’s whereabouts and the possibility of his consorting with other sacrificers. The  final one (vss. 10–12) presents him with the just-pressed soma.  
The transparency of the hymn is produced in great part by its syntax: many of  the verses contain several short, generally pāda-length sentences (vs. 1 is a typi cal example), and more extreme concision is encountered in the abrupt series of  imperatives “come! run! drink!” in the last tr̥ca (vss. 10c and 12c; cf. also 4a). Even  when the sentence extends beyond the pāda, it often deploys simple parallel con stituents across two pādas (e.g., vss. 3ab, 6ab). There is also no overt subordination  in the hymn (unless we count the nahí [“for not”] clause of 2c). There are almost no  past tenses (only in 5c [perfect] and 9a [aorist]); the finite verb forms are otherwise  limited to imperatives, indicative presents, and one presential perfect (8c).  
The sentiments expressed and the vocabulary are likewise uncomplex and stan dard. Only the penultimate verse (11), with its apparent references to locales for  finding soma, causes any interpretive problems.
