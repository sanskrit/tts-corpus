Agni  
Bharga Pragātha  
20 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas  
The focus throughout most of this hymn is Agni in his sacrificial role, a theme strongly  established in the first five verses, and in his close relationship to the household and  clan. As a consequence of this latter relationship he also appears as the protector of  those entities against external threats: see verses 6–10, 12–14, and especially the two  final verses 19–20. The usual prayers for wealth and aid are not absent, however.
