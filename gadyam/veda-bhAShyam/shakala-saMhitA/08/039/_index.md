Agni  
Nābhāka Kāṇva  
10 verses: mahāpaṅkti  
Agni’s role as messenger between heaven and earth and as mediator between gods and  men is particularly emphasized in this hymn. And, in addition to his usual ritual role,  his identity as poet is also mentioned several times (see esp. vss. 1, 7, 9). The hymn  

contains an example of the well-known trope of “pouring prayers” (vs. 3), and in the  middle of the hymn we find a pun on one of Agni’s standard epithets Jāta-vedas, in  verse 6 where it is said that he “knows” (veda) the “races” (jātā́) of gods and men.  
The hymn in general has a benign tone and high discourse level, and so the flip pantly bloodthirsty refrain rests oddly in it. Only in verse 2 does it fit the contents,  and even there the linguistic register is quite distinct between the verse proper and  the refrain.  
The poet handles the six-pāda structure of the mahāpaṅkti flexibly. The last pāda  of each verse is the Nabhāka refrain. Otherwise the first two pādas (ab) and the  fourth and fifth (de) pādas each group together, while the third pāda (c) belongs  sometimes with ab (generally in the first part of the hymn) and sometimes with de  (toward the end, vss. 7–9).
