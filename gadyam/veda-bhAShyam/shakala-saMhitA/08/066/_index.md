66 (675)  
Indra  
Kali Prāgātha  
15 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas, except anuṣṭubh 15  
This hymn of fifteen verses is longer than the Indra hymns that precede it (VIII.62– 65, all twelve verses long), and is therefore out of place in the collection. Oldenberg  suggests (Noten ad loc.) that it may consist of two hymns (or even three): verses 1–81154 VIII.66  
and 9–14, with verse 15 appended in a different meter. However, as he also notes  (1888: 217), there is no strong internal support for this division, and it may very well  be a single hymn.  
The invitation to Indra to the soma sacrifice is the primary theme of the hymn. It  begins with a call for Indra’s help (vs. 1) and continues with descriptions of the sac rificial offerings (vss. 5–8, 11–12), along with the usual hope that Indra will choose  our sacrifice over those of others (see esp. vs. 12). The poet remarks particularly on  the regular and predictable nature of the sacrifice (vs. 7), and in a striking image in  verse 8 suggests to Indra that, since even the apparently uncontrollable wolf follows  its own routine, Indra should make it a habit to attend our sacrifice as he has before.  The regular nature of the sacrifice has its drawbacks, of course: many others before  us and many others around us have performed and continue to perform it, but the  poet assures Indra in verse 11 that although he and his comrades are only the most  recent among the sacrificers, their formulations are novel and unprecedented (see  also vs. 5). The competition between us and the others is emphasized by the numer  
ous occurrences of “many” in this hymn.  
Interspersed are verses celebrating Indra’s power and his aid to his worshipers  (vss. 2–4, 9–10). Not all of this praise is entirely clear, especially that in 3ab, where  Indra is identified with two hapaxes, our translations of which are quite provisional.  In the final pragātha (vss. 13–14) the poet makes his strongest plea for Indra’s help.  The final verse (15), in a different meter as noted, is puzzling. It reassures an oth  
erwise unknown group of people, the Kalis, that if they press soma, whatever is  threatening them will disappear.
