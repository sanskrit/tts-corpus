Agni  
Sudīti Āṅgirasa and/or Purumīḷha Āṅgirasa  
15 verses: gāyatrī arranged in trcas 1–9; br ̥ hat ̥ ī alternating with satobr̥hatī arranged  in pragāthas 10–15  
This, the last hymn of the small Āṅgirasa collection VIII.67–71, falls into two  parts, defined by meter: verse 1–9 in gāyatrī tr̥cas and 10–15 in br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī pragāthas. As Oldenberg suggested (1888: 217; Noten ad loc.), it could be made up  of two separate hymns, and the lack of thematic continuity in fact favors this divi sion, though there is some shared vocabulary. The first names of the two alternative  poets suggested by the Anukramaṇī were extracted from verse 14.  
The first nine verses beg Agni’s protection for the pious worshiper from all  manner of malign and threatening forces, particularly those of other humans. It is Agni’s power as a god that is emphasized, with mortals hostile or devout subject to  this superior divine power, to be punished or rewarded, as they deserve. The second part of the hymn (vss. 10–15) is dominated by a stylistic pattern: Agni  in the accusative case is the goal of sacrificial actions and words throughout this  section. In verse 10 he is not named, but an epithet in the accusative is found in  every pāda of the verse. His name (agním) begins the next verse (11a), and in the  subsequent verses it is featured again and again. Verse 12 contains five occurrences  of agním, one beginning every pāda, plus one in the middle of the third. Verse 13  varies the pattern by beginning with a nominative form of the name, but the second  half-verse returns to the initial accusative, which continues through the subsequent  verses: three examples of initial agním in verse 14 (pādas a, c, d), two in the final verse  (15a, b). The interplay between our ritual devotion and prayers and his gifts and aid  is the topic of this section, but the content is far less noticeable than the form.
