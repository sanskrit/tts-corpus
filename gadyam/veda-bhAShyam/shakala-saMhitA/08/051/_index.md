51 (1020)  
Indra  
Śruṣṭigu Kāṇva  
10 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas. Parallel to 52.  
By contrast to VIII.49–50, the parallelism of these two hymns is quite muted and  surfaces only occasionally. Not only are strict responsions rare, but the develop ment of the thought in each hymn is quite distinct, though both focus on Indra as1134 VIII.51  
generous giver. The correspondence between the two hymns is clearest at the begin ning: both hymns have almost identical initial verses, save for the personal names  of the human hosts. These verses also have the same structure as the final verses  of VIII.49–50.10. There is also some verbal responsion in the beginning of verses  3 and 5, throughout much of verse 6, and at the beginning of verse 7, and there  are also correspondences that cross verse lines, for instance, 51.6c=52.4c táṃ tvā vayám...“we you...,” with the continuation of that pāda (51.6c) maghavann indra  
girvaṇaḥ “o bounteous Indra who longs for songs” matched in 52.8a. As just noted, both hymns are primarily concerned to stimulate Indra to generos ity. In VIII.51 are interspersed several obscure references to unknown sagas: verse 2  with the old, prone Praskaṇva set upright (Praskaṇva figures also in nearby VIII.54.8,  but only as beneficiary of Indra’s largesse, and he is the poet to whom I.44–50 as well  as VIII.49, the first Vālakhilya hymn, are attributed) and Indra’s defeat of Krivi (vs.  8). And in verses 4 and 8, in identical language, an apparently miraculous birth follows  ritual and cosmogonic activity. One of these acts is the chanting of a “seven-headed,  threefold chant in the highest footstep” (vs. 4), and a stripped-down version of the  same phrase, “they chanted the chant” is found in the final verse (10), with the current  poets as subject, thus implicitly attributing cosmogonic powers to the poets of today. The construction of VIII.52 is far less orderly than that of 51. It is characterized  by subordinate clauses that lack main clauses (e.g., vss. 2, 3), lack of grammatical  agreement between apparently coreferential entities (e.g., sg. “whose” picked up  by “we” in vs. 4; similar disharmony in vs. 8), and a general looseness of structure  especially in the verses that lack all responsion to 51. If this was a school exercise,  perhaps it was an unsuccessful one.
