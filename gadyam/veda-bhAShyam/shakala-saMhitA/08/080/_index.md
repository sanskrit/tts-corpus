Indra (1–9), Gods (10)  
Ekadyū Naudhasa  
10 verses: gāyatrī, probably arranged in trcas, except final verse, tri ̥ ṣṭubh 10  
The final pāda of this hymn (10d) is the same as the refrain in the verbally clever and  finely structured hymns of Nodhas Gautama in Maṇḍala I (I.58, 60–64). (R̥gveda  I.59 is also attributed to him, but lacks the refrain; see also nearby VIII.88.) The  patronymic of our poet (Naudhasa) identifies him as a descendant of Nodhas, and  he seems to have inherited some of his ancestor’s skill:  the tone of the hymn is  light and slangy, and he addresses Indra informally and with mocking exasperation,  especially in the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), in which the poet complains that Indra has  been slow to help his chariot in the race (see also vs. 8).  
The poet seems to be withholding his highest praise for Indra until Indra has  earned it. He begins the hymn by announcing that he hasn’t chosen anyone else  for certain as his mercy-giver, and invites Indra to show mercy. He ends the hymn  proper (vs. 9) with a promise that Indra will be proclaimed as lord after he “makes  his fourth sacrificial name.” What these four names are is not at all certain, but  we suggest that the phrase forms a ring with the first verse, where the title/name  “mercy-giver” hasn’t yet been bestowed on the god. The poet is thus urging Indra  to perform the actions that will earn him the names that will attract sacrifice and  praise from mortals.  
In the final verse, in a different meter, the poet names himself and reminds all the  gods (and goddesses, an unusual inclusion) that he has performed service for them,  demanding appropriate recompense.
