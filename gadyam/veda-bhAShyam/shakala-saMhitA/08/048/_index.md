Soma  
Pragātha Kaṇva  
15 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 5  
This well-known and frequently translated hymn is one of the very few dedicated to  Soma outside of the IXth Maṇḍala, and as such does not concern “self-purifying”  Soma (Soma Pavamāna), the subject of that maṇḍala. The preparation of soma  is not treated here, save for a single reference (vs. 7) to it as “pressed.” Instead the  emphasis is on soma’s effects, “when drunk” (pītá vss. 4, 5, 10, 12), on the drinker.  The immediate effect is euphoria; as in the famous exultant boast in verse 3 “we  have drunk the soma; we have become immortal; we have gone to the light; we have  found the gods.” The soma produces a sense of space and boundlessness (vss. 1, 2,  5) while, paradoxically, being confined in the drinker’s body (vss. 2, 9, 10) and hold ing this body together (vs. 5). The temporal equivalent of this spatial expansion is  the wish constantly expressed to “lengthen our lifetime” (vss. 4, 7, 10, 11). Soma is  thus characterized by vitality, or life force, which he also confers on the drinker: the  first and last verses of the hymn contain this signature word váyas.  
The mood in the second half of the hymn darkens slightly. Though the poet still  sees Soma as his protector and kindly comrade, he senses the threats that cause  him to need that protection—threats from outside (vs. 8), from his own imperfect  actions (vs. 9), and even from soma itself (vs. 10). Though he ultimately pronounces  the threats vanquished (vs. 11), the mood of sheer exuberance has been broken.  
The final few verses (12–14) take a more ritual turn, with our ceremonial dedica tion of an oblation to soma, in his connection with the forefathers (who themselves  receive soma, as is made clear elsewhere). The ancestor cult thus briefly surfaces  here, and the emphasis throughout the hymn on lengthening our lifetimes (on  earth) may provide a counterpoint to the ritually shaped afterlife inhabited by our  ancestors.
