Indra (except Maruts 14d, Indra and Br̥haspati 15)  
Tiraścī Āṅgirasa or Dyutāna Māruti  
21 verses: triṣṭubh except virāj 4, arranged in trcas ̥  
A rich and complex hymn containing both glancing references and vivid treatments  of several Indra myths. Its parts conform well to the tr̥ca structure, especially (as  often) toward the end. Each of the last four tr̥cas (vss. 10–21) has a verbal signa ture: in verses 10–12 the half-pāda refrain “surely he will take cognizance” (kuvíd  aṅgá védat); in verses 13–15 the “droplet” (drapsá); in verses 16–18 the opening “you  
then” (tuváṃ ha tyád); in verses 19–21 the definitional “Vr̥tra-smiter” (vr̥trahā́). The first tr̥ca of the hymn (vss. 1–3) sets the stage for the wide-ranging praise  of Indra by describing his overwhelming power in three different areas. In verse 1  the powers of nature are subject to him. Verse 2 apparently contains a snatch of  the Emuṣa myth, most extensively related in VIII.71. In that myth Indra shoots a  boar named Emuṣa through many mountains; here only the mountains and the  arrow-shot are mentioned, but the prodigious nature of the unnamed archer’s  action is clear, and the audience would be aware that this was a boyhood deed of  Indra’s. In verse 3 Indra’s body is described as the site of his powers, both physical  and mental.  
The second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) begins with a summary of his preeminence (vs. 4),  but soon moves to the Vr̥tra battle (vs. 5) and especially to the Maruts’ role in it, a  topic that will also occupy the third tr̥ca. The Maruts appear to be the “formula tors” (brahmáns) introduced at the end of verse 5, bellowing to Indra. Verses 6–9  are best interpreted as the direct speech of the Maruts to Indra, offering him their  praise while seeking an alliance with him. They remind him (vs. 7) that they stuck  and continue to stick by him when the other gods deserted him in the Vr̥tra battle,  and they put in their claim to share the sacrifice with him (vs. 8), a claim also vividly  dramatized in the dialogue hymn I.165. They end their speech (vs. 9) with the reas  
surance that together they, the Maruts and Indra, will make an unbeatable team. The next tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) returns to the ritual present, with the poet’s exhorta tion to himself to produce well-crafted words for Indra—whose attention to the  praises he nervously hopes for. The following tr̥ca (vss. 13–15) is the most puz zling part of the hymn; it concerns an otherwise unknown story about a “droplet”  (drapsá) or perhaps an individual (human? divine? semi-divine?) so named. There is  a conflict of some sort in the Aṃśumatī River, which Indra appears to win in verse  15. The middle verse of the tr̥ca (vs. 14) is 1st-person direct speech and may be the  

words of Indra addressing the Maruts. But the “story” may also be an extended  ritual metaphor. “Droplet” is a word also used of soma, and the name of the river  means literally “possessing (soma) plants.” The descent of the droplet into the river  could well describe the rinsing of the soma plant that forms a regular part of soma  preparation, although the ritual counterpart of the mythic conflict is difficult to  identify.  
Unified by its opening words “you then,” the next tr̥ca (vss. 16–18) provides  a survey of some of Indra’s great deeds, some obscure (like the rivalry with the  unidentified seven in vs. 16), some familiar: the defeat of Śuṣṇa (17c), the release  of the cows from Vala (17d), and the Vr̥tra battle again (18). The last tr̥ca begins  with a riddle, though not a very challenging one. The first three pādas of verse 19  give a series of definitional descriptors of a hero. Those asked the riddle give their  answer to “the other,” in our opinion the riddler himself: “That’s the Vr̥tra-smiter!”  And they provide other embellishments to the Vr̥tra-smiter in the following two  verses (20–21), while declaring the need to invoke and praise him. The hymn thus  keeps returning to the Vr̥tra battle, and the final three verses implicitly assert that  Vr̥tra-smiter is Indra’s fundamental role.
