“ओ त्यमह्वे' इत्यष्टादशर्चं द्वितीयं सूक्तं काण्वस्य सोभरेरार्षम् । आद्यातृतीयापञ्चम्यो बृहत्यो द्वितीयाचतुर्थीषष्ट्यः सतोबृहत्यः सप्तमी बृहती अष्टम्यनुष्टुप् । 'काकुभं प्रागाथं ह' इत्युक्तस्यानुवृत्तेः शिष्टाश्चत्वारः काकुभाः प्रगाथाः । अश्विनौ देवता । तथा चानुक्रान्तम्-‘ओ त्यमाश्विनं त्रिप्रगाथादि बृहत्यनुष्टुबेकादश्याद्ये ककुम्मध्येज्योतिषी' इति । प्रातरनुवाक आश्विने क्रतौ बार्हते छन्दस्याश्विनशस्त्रे चाद्याः सप्तर्चः । सूत्रितं च- ओ त्यमह्व आ रथमिति सप्त' (आश्व. श्रौ. ४. १५) इति ॥

Aśvins  
Sobhari Kāṇva  
18 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī 1–7; anuṣṭubh 8; kakubh alternating with  satobr̥hatī 9–10, 13–18; kakubh 11; madhyejyotis 12, all arranged in pragāthas.  
The metrical complexity of this hymn is not matched by corresponding complexity  of content. The hymn focuses especially on the chariot of the Aśvins, as well as on  their journey to us, the sacrifice with which we will welcome them, and the multi form aid we hope for in return.  
Nonetheless there are a few striking images and turns of phrase, particularly in  verse 6 where the Aśvins “plow barley with a wolf,” an expression that cannot be sep arated from the similar one in I.117.21, likewise an Aśvin hymn, where they “scatter  barley with a wolf.” Starting with Yaska (6.26), the “wolf” has regularly been identi fied as a type of plow, though this recourse to agricultural technology could be taken  as a reductive attempt to explain away the wondrous nature of the Aśvins’ feats—here  perhaps their ability to harness the power of a dangerous and semi-wild beast for a  civilizing task. On the wolf as a cross-category in the Vedic conceptual universe, situ ated between the wild and the civilized and partaking of both, see Jamison (2008b).

Aśvins Esp. towards the end of the hymn, pāda-initial (C)ā becomes an insistent marker: ā́(8c, 9a), yā́(bhiḥ) (10a, b), tā́(bhiḥ) (10c, 12a), yā́(bhiḥ) (12d), tā́(u) (13a, b, c, 14a, b), mā́(14c), ā́(15a), prā(tā́) (15b), ā(rā́ttāc) (16c), ā́(17a). The most concentrated sequence is in vss. 13-14 with the repeated dual prn. tā́(u) ‘these two’, referring to the Aśvins.
