Manu Vaivasvata or Kaśyapa Mārīca  
10 verses: dvipadā virāj (so Anukramaṇī), but really dvipadā satobr̥hatī 

A very tightly and intricately structured riddle hymn. (See discussion in Jamison  2007: 75–77.) Each short verse (dvipāda satobr̥hatī verses contain only twenty syllables apiece) identifies a god (or pair of gods) by attributes or behavior, but not by name—though the referents would be clear to the audience. It is thus, in the first  instance, a list hymn. However, the poet has devised a method to endow the list template with both internal structure and forward momentum. 

In second position of each of the verses is a numeral. In the first seven verses it is ékaḥ “one,” but verses  8 and 9 have dvā́ “two” and the last verse plural éke “some” or, literally, “the ones,”  so that the verse structure builds through the categories of grammatical number,  culminating in the only plural—though since éke belongs to the same stem as ékaḥ, there is also a sense of symmetry and return.  

There is further structure within the subsections of the hymn. The éka verses,  the first seven in the hymn, show an omphalos structure, with the three middle  verses (3–5) having the identical sequence ... éko bibharti háste “the one bears in his  hand.” 

The poet plays with number in other ways in this hymn:

- verse 7, the final  verse containing “one,” begins trī́ṇi ékaḥ “three the one....” The referent is Viṣṇu  and his three strides, so the poet, by introducing a new number, prepares us for our  departure from the singular. 
- Similarly, the next verse, the first with “two,” also contains “one”: VIII.29.8a víbhir dvā́ carata ékayā sahá “With the birds the two wander  along with the one” [=the two Aśvins plus Sūryā], with the feminine instrumental  ékayā providing a transition between the “one” verses and the “two” verses.  

If we are correct, the lone and climactic plural éke in verse 10 also has a different status from the apparently parallel numerals in the previous verses. As previously noted, each riddling verse defines a god, but in this last verse the identity  of the éke is not entirely clear: the Aṅgirases or Atri(s) have been suggested (see  Geldner’s note ad loc.). I would suggest instead that this verse now turns to the  world of men by presenting the poets’ self-identification. The poets themselves (or  their ancestors) are the solution to this final riddle. They draw attention to their  own creative activity (or that of their ancestors), and as often in final verses they  make a sort of meta-reference to the rest of the hymn that precedes this announcement: it is this same hymn that they are chanting now. At the same time the rigid  poetic parallel structure implicitly claims for the mortal poets the same status as  the gods they have just celebrated, since they are numerically identified in the same  type of riddle as the gods of verses 1–9. 

In favor of the view that human poets/ ritualists are the subject of verse 10 is the presence of the words árcanta(ḥ)...sā́ma “chanting...melody.” Joining these two words in the same clause seems intended  to evoke the technical terms r´̥c “verse” (of the R̥gveda) and the sā́man “melody”  (of the Sāmaveda) to which it is set, major components of Vedic ritual utterance,  and therefore to mark the event depicted as a contemporary ritual of the present  Vedic community.+++(4)+++ “Causing the sun to shine” may ascribe a cosmogonic act to the  original performance of the ritual, or (more likely in our view) simply suggest that  the hymns uttered at the daily dawn ritual actually ensure the rising and shining of  the sun, rather than simply celebrating it.  

Thus the poem skillfully combines and balances architectonic structures with  forward, developing movement, and does so in a remarkably economical package.  The development is not only formal, for the order in which the gods are presented  takes us from the here-and-now of the ritual ground (Soma and Agni), through the  mythical space where gods perform deeds that have effects on men (Tvaṣṭar, Indra,  Rudra, Pūṣan), to the airy and heavenly spaces (Viṣṇu, Aśvins and Sūryā, Mitra and  Varuṇa), ending specifically “in heaven” (diví). 

Yet, despite all this clever machinery,  the hymn wears its structure lightly, and the mechanisms that provide so much pleasure are essentially invisible to the audience.
