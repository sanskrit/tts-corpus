Agni or Praise of Oblations  
Haryata Prāgātha  
18 verses: gāyatrī  
This hymn is so opaque that it is not even clear to whom, or what, it is dedicated.  The Anukramaṇī gives two choices: Agni or “praise of oblations” (haviṣāṃ stutiḥ).  There are several good reasons to prefer the second designation, or at least to reject  the first. On the one hand, Agni is named only once, close to the end (vs. 15) and  in conjunction with Indra. Though the ritual fire and its divine representative are  clearly the referents in a number of verses, a number of different ritual substances  and apparatus are also referred to through the hymn; the fire is not significantly  more prominent. Moreover, as Oldenberg points out (1888: 217), the third hymn  in this little collection is clearly to Agni, so that the first should have a different  dedicand.  
As a number of scholars have noted, the hymn contains a sequence of ritual  moments, sometimes even quoting from mantras found in later ritual, depicted in  allusive and indirect fashion. Although some have tried to find a systematic and  sequential representation of the, or a, sacrifice, these efforts have not been suc  
cessful. Rather we seem to have a set of discontinuous sacrificial vignettes, cast as  riddles. Though nowhere near as famous as the well-known riddle hymn (I.164),  this hymn resembles that one in certain ways, including a fondness for numerology  (vss. 7–9) and for unidentified referents (throughout).  
We confess to being uncertain about many of the answers to these implicit rid dles, and for others the machinery of explanation would overwhelm the poetry.  We have therefore for the most part avoided parenthetical identifications and para phrases. In general the first verses (esp. 2–5) seem to concern Agni and the initiation of the sacrifice, signaled by the sighting of the horses and chariot (of the sun?) in  verse 6. Most of the rest of the hymn, verses 7–17, concerns the preparation of  soma. The final verse (18) has much the same structure as verse 6, which closed the  first section of the hymn, and has similar annunciatory function.

Agni or Praise of Oblations See the published introduction. for the general structure and manifold difficulties of this hymn. For disc. of the possible ritual details, see Oldenberg, Geldner, Renou, etc. For the most part I will not comment on such here.
