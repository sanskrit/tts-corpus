Soma Pavamāna  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
Another unremarkable gāyatrī hymn. Parallel constructions and phraseol ogy (e.g., the fronted “for you” [túbhyam] in vss. 3, 5, the fronted “be/become”  [bhávā] of vss. 2, 4) give a sense of unity. Unlike many soma hymns, where the  finale delivers the soma to Indra (e.g., the final verses of nearby hymns such as  IX.23.6–7, 26.6, 27.6, 30.6), here it is “we” who declare our desire for his pres ence and partnership (vs. 6).  
The poet, Gotama Rāhūgaṇa, is also the composer of a soma hymn in the first  maṇḍala, I.91, and verse 4 in this hymn is identical to I.91.16, which occurs in a  triad of ritually connected verses.
