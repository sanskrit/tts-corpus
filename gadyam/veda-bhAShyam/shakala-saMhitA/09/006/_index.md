Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
Soma’s journey—to the gods, to Indra, and to us, as well as to the state of exhila ration and to material rewards—is the primary subject of this hymn. In the last two verses (8–9) Soma’s association with poetry and with the exercise of poetic  skill is mentioned. The last statement, that Soma takes to himself hymns, though  they are hidden, is not entirely clear, but it may refer to his ability to stimulate  poetic inspiration, and to cause poets to create new hymns from deep within  themselves.  
Noteworthy is also the pun in verse 2, where the drop (índu) is urged to flow as  “Indra.” The phonological similarity between these two words is often exploited  elsewhere, indeed in the immediately preceding hymn (IX.5.9).
