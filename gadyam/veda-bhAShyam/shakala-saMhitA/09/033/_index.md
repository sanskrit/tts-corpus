Soma Pavamāna  
Trita Āptya  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
Once again the hymn begins with the soma flowing forth. There is, however, less  emphasis on the physical process of purification, and more on the sounds that  accompany it: verse 4 introduces three voices, which may be the three types of ritual  speech, the r̥c, yajus, and sāman familiar from later śrauta ritual, or may refer to the  priestly formulations (5a), the bellowing of the cows (4b), and the roar of the rush  
ing soma itself (4c). The theme continues in verse 5, which also highlights “truth,”  found in verse 2 as well.  
The hymn is bookended by watery references: the simile of the waves of water  in verse 1 returns in the final verse (6) as the seas of wealth that soma will produce  for us.
