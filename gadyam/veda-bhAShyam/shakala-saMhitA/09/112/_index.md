‘नानानम्' इति चतुर्ऋचं नवमं सूक्तमाङ्गिरसस्य शिशुनाम्न आर्षम् । पञ्चपदा पङ्क्तिश्छन्दः । पवमानः सोमो देवता । तथा चानुक्रान्तं -- नानानं चतुष्कं शिशुः पाङ्क्तं हि' इति । गतो विनियोगः ॥

Soma Pavamāna  
Śiśu Āṅgirasa  
4 verses: paṅkti  
This charming little hymn has no obvious connection to soma except through its  refrain (which it shares with the next two hymn, 113–114, also in the same meter),  which sits oddly in each verse, and through the glancing mention of the soma-presser  in 1d. The diversity of people’s occupations and of their goals is the theme, presented  in casual style and sometimes colloquial language (see especially the designations for  father and mother in vs. 3), with the gently cynical message that what everyone really  wants is gain or an easy life. The final verse (4) opens out to the nonhuman world.  
Perhaps the most interesting verse, as a small window on realia, is the second  one, which presents a rare picture of a smith and his equipment. The “old plants”  must be for producing a hot fire, the “feathers of birds” for fanning the flames, and  the stones are probably whetstones.  
Casting about for a reason for the refrain and for the inclusion of this hymn in  the IXth Maṇḍala—it may be that the point of the refrain is that, like the people  and animals mentioned in the body of the text, the drop has its own goal, particular  to itself, namely simply to seek Indra. Or perhaps the hymn was simply too delight  
ful to abandon.
