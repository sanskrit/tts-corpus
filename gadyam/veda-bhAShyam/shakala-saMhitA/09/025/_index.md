Soma Pavamāna  
Drḍ̥ hacyuta Āgastya  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
This is the only hymn in the R̥gveda attributed to this poet, though his patronymic  connects him to Agastya, the poet of a number of hymns in the late Ist Maṇḍala  (I.165–91)—including the dialogue hymn I.165, in which Agastya mediates between  Indra and the Maruts, who demand a share of the soma sacrifice. This connection  may account for the mention of the Maruts in verse 1 as recipients of soma, along  with Vāyu: the Maruts are quite scarce in the Soma Maṇḍala.  
The hymn is otherwise unremarkable, though one might note the insistent iden tification of Soma as a kaví (“poet,” vss. 3, 5, 6).
