‘कनिक्रन्ति' इति पञ्चर्चं दशमं सूक्तं कण्वपुत्रस्य प्रस्कवस्यार्षम् । तथानुक्रम्यते--- कनिक्रन्ति प्रस्कण्वः' इति । पूर्ववच्छन्दोदेवते । गतो विनियोगः ॥

95 (807)  
Soma Pavamāna  
Praskaṇva Kāṇva  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
As in the preceding hymn, IX.94, the complementarity and interaction between  Soma’s poetic efforts and those of the ritualists provide the subject of this hymn.  Soma’s speech is the topic of the first two verses, culminating in 2cd in his revelation  of the “hidden names of the gods” that will be proclaimed aloud on the ritual ground.  But the verbal compositions of the mortals take center stage in verses 3–4. In the final  verse (5), Soma both prompts the speech of others and (it seems) produces his own.

This hymn is attributed to Praskaṇva Kāṇva, the poet of I.44-50, the group of hymns that follow those of Kaṇva Ghaura, the poet of immediately preceding IX.94.
