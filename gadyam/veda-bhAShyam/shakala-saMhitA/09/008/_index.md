Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
Although this hymn is, of course, dedicated to self-purifying Soma, the process is  repeatedly described in the passive (“being purified,” vss. 2, 3, 6) rather than in the  usual reflexive construction. However, this grammatical peculiarity does not seem  to deprive Soma of agency: he (or his juices) are urged to increase Indra’s power (vs. 1), provide us with power (vss. 2, 8), cause Indra to be generous to us (vs. 3) and  provide us with mortal patrons as well (vs. 7), remove hostilities (vs. 7), and cause  the rain to fall (vs. 8), among other things.  
The middle verses (4–6) concern the preparation of soma; as usual, the materials  used in the preparation are animatized (vss. 5–6): the “ewes” are the fleece filter, the  “cows” and “cattle” the milk-mixture.  
The first three verses reunite the group of gods to whom Soma went in the previ ous hymn (IX.7.7): Vāyu and the Aśvins (vs. 2) and Indra (vss. 1, 3), the principal  deities of the Morning Pressing.
