‘प्र गायत्रेण' इति चतुर्ऋचं षट्त्रिंशं सूक्तं काश्यपस्यावत्सारस्यार्षम्। तृतीया पुरउष्णिगाद्यद्वादशका द्व्यष्टका । शिष्टा गायत्र्यः । पवमानः सोमो देवता । तथा चानुक्रान्तं- प्र गायत्रेणोपान्त्या पुरउष्णिक्' इति । उक्तो विनियोगः ॥

Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
A satisfyingly tight structure knits together this little hymn. The first and last verses  contain the epithet “boundless” (vícarṣaṇi) providing a faint ring. More salient is  the chaining from verse to verse: a significant portion of the final pāda of one verse  opens the next verse.  
The hymn also has extra-hymnic structural echoes: its final pāda is identical to  the final pāda of the first verse of the preceding hymn (IX.59.1), ascribed to the  same poet, save for “semen” in place of “treasure.”

The next 8 hymns, the last ones before the lengthy hymns assembled from tṛcas (IX.61-68) that end the dimeter collection, are attributed to Avatsāra Kāśyapa. All of them contain four vss., and a number of them are structured such that the first three vss. form a unity, with the last vs. stylistically or thematically contrastive or completive. See esp.

IX.53-57. Oldenberg tends to analyze them as a tṛca with Schlussvers, which is strictly accurate, but I think the point is the interplay of 3+1.
