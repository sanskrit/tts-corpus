Soma Pavamāna  
Medhyātithi Kāṇva  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
In this last hymn attributed to Medhyātithi, he is at particular pains to draw atten tion to the importance of the poet’s role in the preparation of the soma. Not only  does he name himself in verse 3, but the first three verses emphasize the clothing  (vs. 1), beautification (vs. 2), and adornment (vs. 3) of Soma with hymns. In the  final verse (6) he asks for a proper recompense for the poet (that is, himself) who  produces these hymns.
