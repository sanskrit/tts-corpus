Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
Although entirely focused on the process of soma preparation, this hymn displays  the common rhetorical inflation of this process by associating it with cosmic ele ments. Thus, for example, in verse 4 Soma is both “in the navel of heaven” and “in  the sheep’s fleece”—both referring to the filter; the “surface of the sea” in verse 6  is either the soma itself collected in the vessel or the water with which it mixes; the  “dear tracks of heaven” in verse 8 are the meanderings of soma through the fleece  filter (see also IX.10.9). The buffalo-cow in verse 3 is probably the hide on which the  pressing apparatus is set. Only in the last verse (9) does the poet make any requests  of the god.

Lüders tr. and comm. on vss. 1-6 of this hymn (706-7), with his usual, often overblown, emphasis on the heavenly location of the elements and actions. By contrast, I tend to attribute the heavenly references to the poet’s attempt to project a cosmic dimension on the ritual confined to a small portion of the earth’s surface.
