Soma Pavamāna  
Uśanas Kāvya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The standard tropes of soma preparation, the swelling of Soma in water, his  manipulation by the priests’ fingers, his journey across the filter, and his mixing  with milk, provide the subject of this hymn, but, as often, each of these depic tions has a cosmic dimension—as in verses 1–2, where Soma is compared with  heavenly rain.

These three hymns are attributed to Uśanas Kāvya, probably on the basis of the mention of his name in 87.3.
