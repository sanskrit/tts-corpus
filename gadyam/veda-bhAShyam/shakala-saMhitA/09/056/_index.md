Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
The first three verses of this simple hymn describe Soma’s journey in the filter (vs.  1), as the liquid separates into multiple streams in the channels of the fleece (vs. 2),  and his preparation by the fingers (vs. 3). The fourth verse then requests protection  for ourselves and our men, while urging the soma to flow for its divine recipients.

The next 8 hymns, the last ones before the lengthy hymns assembled from tṛcas (IX.61-68) that end the dimeter collection, are attributed to Avatsāra Kāśyapa. All of them contain four vss., and a number of them are structured such that the first three vss. form a unity, with the last vs. stylistically or thematically contrastive or completive. See esp.

IX.53-57. Oldenberg tends to analyze them as a tṛca with Schlussvers, which is strictly accurate, but I think the point is the interplay of 3+1.
