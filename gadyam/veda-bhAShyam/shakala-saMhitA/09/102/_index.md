‘क्राणा शिशुः' इत्यष्टर्चं षष्ठं सूक्तमाप्त्स्य त्रितस्यार्षम् । इदमुत्तराणि चत्वारि सूक्तान्यौष्णिहानि । पवमानः सोमो देवता। तथा चानुक्रम्यते- क्राणाष्टौ त्रित औष्णिहं वै' इति । गतो विनियोगः ॥

Soma Pavamāna  
Trita Āptya  
8 verses: uṣṇih The many obscurities in this hymn exist in tension with the clarity of its larger  structure: it is a ring composition, with a pāda-length phrase in the first and last  verses (1b, 8c) defining the ring: “spurring on the visionary power of truth.” This  phrase also sets one of the underlying themes, that Soma during his preparation  inspires and creates poetic truth. There is clarity also in the general progression of  the hymn, which follows Soma’s journey from the press (vs. 2) and across the filter  (vs. 3) to his final preparation (vs. 7). Another theme that runs throughout is that of  Soma as a child in relation to his mothers (vss. 1, 4, 7; see also 6), who not only gave  him physical birth but also formed him in his ritual rule (see vs. 4).  
It must be admitted, however, that much remains puzzling in the hymn. There  are a number of problems of syntax and lexicon. The two adjacent appearances  of Trita (or “the third one,” vss. 2–3) are also unclear, though they clearly play  on the numerals two and three found in those verses. The hymn is ascribed by the  Anukramaṇī to Trita Āptya, and so it might be that the poet is simply inserting  himself in the poem. But, since Trita Āptya is actually a mythological figure, it is  more likely that the Anukramaṇī has assigned the hymn to that figure on the basis  of the occurrences of tritá in those two verses.
