Soma Pavamāna  
Reṇu Viśvāmitra  
10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10  
An intricate and difficult hymn, some of whose puzzles remain unsolved. The  theme of the hymn is the difference between, and ultimate unity of, heavenly Soma  and earthly, ritual Soma—a theme that was also the subject of nearby IX.68. The  disjunction is announced in the first verse, where the “real” milk-mixture is pro  
duced in heaven, and the worlds are Soma’s garment. In verse 2, by contrast, it  seems that the earthly Soma is seeking a share of his heavenly counterpart by per forming cosmic deeds through ritual means. A rapprochement is effected in verse  3, where Soma’s beacons (kétu) go to and work upon both men and gods, and as a  consequence they accept him as their king; on the basis of other passages in which  this term is found, the beacons appear to be both his cosmic sunlike rays and the  glinting streams of ritual soma as they circle in the filter. The intermediary role of  Soma between gods and men and Heaven and Earth remains the subject of the fol lowing verses (4–6), though not all is clear, especially the first half of verse 4 and  the last half of verse 6. The last four verses (7–10) return us to the ritual Soma and  his ultimate goal, the body of Indra, but the cosmic associations he acquired in the  earlier parts of the hymn make him nourishment fit for the gods.

The theme of these three hymns, particularly insistent in the first and last, is the difference between and ultimate unity of earthly and heavenly Soma.
