'प्र सोमासः' इति सप्तर्चं चतुर्विंशं सूक्तम् । असितो देवलो वर्षिर्गायत्री छन्दः सोमो देवता । ‘प्र सोमासः' इत्यनुक्रान्तम् । गतो विनियोगः ॥

Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
7 verses: gāyatrī  
This hymn is the last attributed to Asita or Devala Kāśyapa, and yet again the hymn  begins with the running forth of the soma juices. It is an unremarkable hymn, but  covers the major topics, though not in strict chronological order:  the grooming  in water (vs. 1), the mixture with milk (vs. 2), the filtering (vss. 3, 5). That soma is  Indra’s drink is repeatedly emphasized (vss. 2, 3, 5, and under the qualifier “con  
queror of territories,” a word regularly applied to Indra, vs. 4). Soma himself is  given the most characteristic of Indra’s epithets—“obstacle-smasher”—in the  superlative in verse 6.
