Soma Pavamāna  
Brhanmati ̥ Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
The hymn begins with a martial theme that is not developed in what follows. Instead,  beginning with verse 3, the focus is on the wealth that Soma will bring us, and the  repetition of vocabulary in these four verses induces a sense of claustrophobia,  with the same elements recycled: “o Soma,” “o drop,” “purifying,” “bring us,” and  “wealth.” Although claustrophobia is to some extent endemic to the IXth Maṇḍala,  most hymns make some attempt to vary the lexicon and phraseology.
