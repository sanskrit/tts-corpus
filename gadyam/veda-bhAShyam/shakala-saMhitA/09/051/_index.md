Soma Pavamāna  
Ucathya Āṅgirasa  
5 verses: gāyatrī  
This simple hymn sets Soma in relation both to the humans involved in his prepa ration, namely the Adhvaryu priest (vs. 1) and the praiser (vs. 4), and to the gods  who consume him, Indra (vss. 1–2), the gods in general, and the Maruts (vs. 3).  The entry into the filter, mentioned in verses 1 and 5, provides an elementary ring.
