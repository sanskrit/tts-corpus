‘सोमस्य धारा' इति पञ्चर्चं त्रयोदशं सूक्तं भारद्वाजस्य वसुनाम्न आर्षं जागतं पवमानसोमदेवताकम् । तथा चानुक्रान्तं- सोमस्य वसुर्भारद्वाजः' इति । गतो विनियोगः ॥

Soma Pavamāna  
Vasu Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: jagatī  
On the one hand, this hymn is somewhat static, stuck at the same stage of soma’s  preparation, as the almost exact responsion of the last two verses (4–5) emphasizes.  On the other hand, Soma’s relationship with the gods, especially Indra, a relation ship that figures in every verse, enlarges the conceptual frame of the hymn and  keeps it from seeming airless.
