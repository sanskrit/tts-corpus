‘एष कविः' इति षडृचं तृतीयं सूक्तं नृमेधनाम्न अङ्गिरसस्यार्षं गायत्रं सौम्यम् । ‘एष कविर्नृमेधः' इत्यनुक्रान्तम् । उक्तो विनियोगः ॥

Soma Pavamāna  
Nr̥medha  Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
Though attributed to a different poet and a different poetic lineage, this hymn,  like the last one (IX.26), is unified by a repeated initial pronoun in every verse, in  this case “this one, he” (eṣá) referring to Soma. Again, the content is conventional,  though there is emphasis on Soma’s victories and acquisitions (vss. 1, 2, 3, 4) and  his successful competition with the sun (vss. 2, 5). The cosmic aspect of Soma is  thus raised but not insisted upon.

As noted in the published introduction, this hymn, like the immediately preceding one, is unified by the simple device of a pronoun (here eṣá ‘this one’) repeated at the beginning of each vs. and rendered as such in English. Unlike the preceding hymn there is no switch of person at the end.
