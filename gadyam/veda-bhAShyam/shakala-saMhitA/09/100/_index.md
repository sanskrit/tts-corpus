Soma Pavamāna  
Two sons of Rebha, the Kāśyapas  
9 verses: anuṣṭubh  
As Oldenberg suggests (1888:  128–29), in order to conform to the principles of  arrangement, this hymn must have originally consisted of two separate hymns, of  five and four verses respectively. This division, made solely on numerical grounds,  is confirmed by the structure of the hymn, for the final four verses repeat or ring  changes on the first five. Verse 6, the first of the original second hymn, is structur  
ally, and in part verbally, identical to the final verse of the original first hymn (5),  but also incorporates, in variant form, verse 4d. Verse 7 repeats much of verse 1 in  different order. Verse 8 deviates more from its model, verse 2, but reproduces verse  2d verbatim as verse 8d. Verse 9 is the most distant from its model, verse 3, but  contains the “heaven and earth” found in the “earthly and heavenly goods” of 3cd.  Once again we see the ways in which the R̥gvedic poet uses formulaic language and  poetic templates for his own purposes.

On the structure of this hymn, or rather two twinned hymns (1-5, 4-9), see published introduction. The hymn also has an even higher percentage of repeated and partially repeated pādas than usual in the Soma maṇḍala. See Geldner’s nn. for some of them.
