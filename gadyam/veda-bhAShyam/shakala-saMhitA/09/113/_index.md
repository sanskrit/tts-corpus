113 (825)  
Soma Pavamāna  
Kaśyapa Mārīca  
11 verses: paṅkti  
The special interest of this hymn rests in the vision of heaven in its second half.  Most strikingly, the imagery that describes this heaven—its freedom, joy, and sat isfaction of all desires—occurs again in the Upaniṣads to characterize the mysti cal realization of the self. The hymn begins more or less as a conventional soma  hymn, however. In verse 1 Indra is urged to drink the soma to strengthen himself  for action, and in verse 2 Soma is commanded to purify himself, with the signature  imperative pavasva. Verse 2 also introduces the theme of true ritual speech, which is  taken up again in verses 4–6. Verse 3 seems to contain an interlude about the rain,  which provides the sap to the soma plant, though the mythological sequence involv ing the Daughter of the Sun and the Gandharvas is obscure.  
Verses 6 and 7 are the omphalos verses and provide a dramatic transition from  the poet’s description of the preparation of soma in the first half of the hymn to  a vision of heaven (vss. 7–11), where immortality and the fulfillment of all desires  are attained. Verse 6 is still set on the ritual ground and is in some ways the climax  of the hymn, for it anticipates the drinking of the soma. Since soma is the drink of  deathlessness, the ceremony becomes the place of immortality. Verse 6 is also gram  
matically incomplete, consisting only of a dependent clause and producing tension  awaiting resolution in a main clause that will answer the implicit question: “what  will happen in this ‘where’?” The first half of verse 7 is responsive to 6 and thus  builds the tension, but the locus of the “where” has changed: the poet has trans  
formed the ritual space into the heavenly realm. The tension finds its release in the  second half of verse 7, with the long-postponed main clause. The remaining verses  reproduce the structure of verse 7, enlarging and embellishing the vision of the  immortal world.  
What links the first half of the hymn to the second, besides the transforma tive responsion of verses 6–7? The answer is not entirely clear, but it seems that  the true speech that accompanies the preparation of the soma (vs. 2), perhaps the  natural speech of the thunder (vs. 3), the true speech Soma himself speaks (vs. 4),  the sacred formulation with which he is purified (vs. 5), and the verbal behavior of the formulator of that formulation (vs. 6) provide Soma with the power to bestow  immortality. He does so by placing the poet in the immortal realms, and placing is  also a recurrent theme in the first half of the hymn: Indra places soma’s strength  in himself in verse 1; the rain is placed in soma as his juice in verse 3; soma is pre  
pared by the Placer in verse 4; the sun was placed in the heavenly world in 7b, and  finally the poet implores Soma to place him in the same world in 7c. The first two  of these placings also involve clear transformation of substance:  soma becomes  Indra’s strength; the rain becomes soma’s sap. We can also see transformation in  the Placer’s preparation of soma in verse 4, as this preparation makes a physical  substance into a drink of immortality, and ultimately in Soma’s placing of the poet  in the immortal world, which will make the poet himself immortal. The command  of the second half of verse 7 “place me in that immortal, imperishable world” is fol lowed by the command refrain of the remaining four verses (8–11), “there make me  immortal,” a sequence that appears to support the notion that the “placing” both  precedes and causes the poet’s transformation.
