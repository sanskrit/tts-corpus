Soma Pavamāna  
Priyamedha Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
Attributed to another Āṅgirasa, whose given name is similar to the poet of the last  hymn (IX.27), this follows the same pattern, with initial “he, that one” (eṣá) opening  every verse. Otherwise it is constructed of the usual clichés, though the rhetoric is  nicely balanced.

Like the last hymn, this one has eṣá beginning every vs. Although the hymns share some vocabulary and themes (as which Soma hymns do not?), they are not twinned.
