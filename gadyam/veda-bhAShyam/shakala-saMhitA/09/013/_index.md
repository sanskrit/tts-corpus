॥ श्रीगणेशाय नमः ॥

यस्य निःश्वसितं वेदा यो वेदेभ्योऽखिलं जगत्।

निर्ममे तमहं वन्दे विद्यातीर्थमहेश्वरम् ॥

षष्ठस्य सप्तमोऽध्यायः संग्रहात्संप्रदर्शितः ।

अथाष्टमः सुमतिना संगमेन प्रदर्श्यते ॥

तत्र सोमः पुनानः' इति नवचं त्रयोदशं सूक्तम् । असितो देवलो वर्षिः। सोमो देवता । ‘ पवमानगुणः सोमो विज्ञेयः काश्यपावृषी । इति विद्यादनुक्तेऽपि लाघवाया दृळ्हच्युतात् ॥ ‘सोमः इत्यनुक्रान्तम् । गतो विनियोगः ॥

13 (725)  
Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
The first verse, with its mention of Vāyu and Indra, identifies this as the first soma offering of the day. Otherwise the hymn is a confection of clichés familiar from  many other soma hymns.

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

This hymn is dominated by forms of med. pávate (vss. 2-4, 8-9), with the first vs. containing instead med. punānáḥ. Only vss. 6-7 lack such forms. Perhaps coincidentally, these two vss. are the only ones containing similes.

The hymn is also constructed from bricolage and ready-made phrases, many found verbatim in other hymns. There is a certain amount of chaining between vss.; it is difficult to know if this is just a result of the assembly process (a word in one vs. suggests to the poet another such phrase, which he then attaches) or was meant as a unifying poetic device.
