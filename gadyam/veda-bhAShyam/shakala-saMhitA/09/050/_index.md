Soma Pavamāna  
Ucathya Āṅgirasa  
5 verses: gāyatrī  
The next three hymns (IX.50–52) are attributed to the same poet, who is not otherwise  found in the R̥gveda. This hymn has a distinct focus on sound, that of Soma as he is  being prepared (vs. 1), of (probably) the officiating priests (vs. 3), and of the ritual  chant (vs. 4). A potential pun in verse 2 suggests that the priestly voices there are both  competing with each other and seeking the sacrificial reward. Verse 5 contains another  potential pun, with the same word (aktú) meaning both “ointments” and “nights.”
