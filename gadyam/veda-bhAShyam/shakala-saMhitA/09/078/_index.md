Soma Pavamāna  
Kavi Bhārgava  
5 verses: jagatī  
A fairly straightforward hymn. The first three verses treat the preparation of the  soma: after being swollen with water it is sent forth into the filter, which captures  the plant detritus, on its way to the milk mixture (vs. 1); it goes across the filter and  into the cup (vs. 2); and it is mixed with waters, here unusually personified as the  nymph-like females, the Apsarases (vs. 3). The last two verses list the benefits that  will accrue to us when the gods drink the soma.
