Soma Pavamāna  
Rahūgaṇa Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
Like the previous hymn, attributed to the same poet, this hymn is unified by the  repetition of a pronominal phrase at the beginning of every verse (eṣá syá “this  very one,” except for vs. 2, which has only the first pronoun). It, too, concerns  Soma’s journey through the filter (especially the first and last verses, 1 and 6) and  his manipulation by the officiant’s fingers (vss. 2, 3). The hymn is enlivened by meta  
phors and similes, particularly those of verse 4.

Like IX.37 with sá opening every vs., every vs. in this hymn begins with a form of the eṣá- pronoun. The pattern here is both more complex and more emphatic: there is case variation (vss. 2 and 3 have acc. sg. etám, the rest nom. sg. eṣá), and in all vss. but vs. 2 the initial pronoun is followed by the appropriate form of syá-/tyá-: eṣá (u) syá, etáṃ tyám, a phrase that means ‘this very (one)’.
