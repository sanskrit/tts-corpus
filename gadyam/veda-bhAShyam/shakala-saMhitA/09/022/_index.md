Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
7 verses: gāyatrī  
The hymn begins with the conventional image of the soma juices racing forward (vs.  1), but their journey soon becomes both cosmic and mystical. Their rush is com pared to cosmic forces in verse 2, and in verses 4–5 they travel through the cosmos  itself. But the poet reaches even further conceptually: he equates this cosmic jour ney with a ritual one. In matched expressions in verses 3 and 5 the juices pervade  not only the cosmic spaces (vs. 5) but also our “insights” (vs. 3), that is, the thoughts  that produce ritual poetry. And in verse 6 they reach a higher place than the cosmic  
space, namely the sacrifice itself, symbolized, as often, by the stretched thread. In the final verse (7) this journey theme is abruptly abandoned, and the disjunc tion between this verse and what precedes is also conveyed by the switch from plural  (“soma juices”) to singular (“Soma”), and from 3rd-person reference to 2nd. It also  contains an implicit equation of Soma with (the unmentioned) Saramā, Indra’s dog  

who reacquired for him the cows stolen by the Paṇis (see esp. X.108)—an equation  seemingly unmotivated by what precedes. (The Paṇis are mentioned only one other  time in the IXth Maṇḍala [IX.11.2].) Perhaps the cosmic journey of Soma reminded  the poet of Saramā’s long trek. The stretched thread of the sacrifice ends the hymn,  and brings it back to the ritual scene.
