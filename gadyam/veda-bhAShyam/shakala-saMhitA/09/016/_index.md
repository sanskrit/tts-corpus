Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
8 verses: gāyatrī  
This little hymn presents several difficulties of interpretation, even though like  many hymns in this series it does not deviate from the ritual scene, especially the fil tering of the pressed juice, and it is built around a limited verbal lexicon, especially  the phonological near mirror images √sr̥j “surge” and √r̥ṣ “rush.” In verse 1 Soma  is implicitly identified with Etaśa, the sun’s horse, and in verse 7 he swells “like the  back of heaven.” But otherwise cosmic references and comparisons are absent, and the soma again and again runs across the filter (vss. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8) and joins with  the waters (vss. 2–3) and the milk (vss. 2 and 6), to furnish Indra’s drink (vss. 3, 5). The most problematic form is the hapax ánapta in verse 3, about which there is  no scholarly agreement. We have very tentatively connected it with naptī́ “grand daughter,” a very rare word that nonetheless appears twice in this poet’s collection  (IX.9.1, 14.5), used of the preparers of soma or their equipment.
