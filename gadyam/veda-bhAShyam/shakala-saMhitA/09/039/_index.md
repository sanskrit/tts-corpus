Soma Pavamāna  
Brhanmati ̥ Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
This hymn is structured as a ring of sorts: it begins and ends with quoted direct  speech, uttered by unidentified speakers but most likely priests. In verse 1 Soma  makes his journey through the filter to the place on the ritual ground where the  gods await their oblation. When he arrives there in verse 6, the priests order him to  take his seat. In between, Soma’s journey involves travel in both ritual and cosmic  space (see esp. vss. 2, 4).
