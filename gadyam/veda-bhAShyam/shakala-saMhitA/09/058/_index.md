Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
A curious little hymn or hymn-fragment. All four verses have a pāda-length refrain,  which is entirely applicable to Soma, and the hymn begins with this same refrain.  The first verse is clearly a soma verse throughout, but verse 2 is more appropriate to  Dawn and verses 3 and 4 appear to be an abbreviated dānastuti. The patrons named  in verse 3 are identified as protegés of the Aśvins in I.112.23 (though with the first in  slightly different form); middle Vedic literature also has a confused tradition about  these same personages.

The next 8 hymns, the last ones before the lengthy hymns assembled from tṛcas (IX.61-68) that end the dimeter collection, are attributed to Avatsāra Kāśyapa. All of them contain four vss., and a number of them are structured such that the first three vss. form a unity, with the last vs. stylistically or thematically contrastive or completive. See esp.

IX.53-57. Oldenberg tends to analyze them as a tṛca with Schlussvers, which is strictly accurate, but I think the point is the interplay of 3+1.
