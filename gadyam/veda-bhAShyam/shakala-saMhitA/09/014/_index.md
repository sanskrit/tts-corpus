Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
8 verses: gāyatrī  
The poet of this hymn seems to be practicing his figurative language, presenting us in  nonsequential verses with several different versions of the same step in the prepara tion of soma. This is especially clear in his depiction of the manual manipulation of  soma: in verse 2 the hands are called “troops of five kinsmen,” in verse 5 the same  fingers are “the granddaughters of Vivasvant” (here the prototype sacrificer), and  in verse 7 a standard word for “fingers” finally makes its appearance. Similarly he  gives two quite similar expressions for the mixing with milk, both using the image  of clothing (vss. 3, 5), and in verse 6 there is a glancing reference to Soma’s desire  for cows.  
The episodic structure of the hymn also seems reflected in the shifting tenses of  the verbs. In particular, the past tense of verse 3ab seems to follow directly from  verse 1, with the presents of verses 2 and 3c in alternation.
