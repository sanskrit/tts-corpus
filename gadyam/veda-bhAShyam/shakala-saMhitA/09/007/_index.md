‘असृग्रम्' इति नवर्चं सप्तमं सूक्तम् । ' असृग्रम्' इत्यनुक्रान्तम् । असितो देवलो वर्षिः ।। तौ च कश्यपगोत्रजौ' । गायत्रं छन्दः । सोमः पवमानो देवता । उक्तो विनियोगः ॥

Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
The word “soma” does not appear at all in this hymn, and the epithet “self-purify ing” (pávamāna) only once, in verse 5 (a finite verb form from the same root is found  in vs. 8). Verses 1 and 8 have a similar structure, especially in their final pādas, and  

form a ring, with the last verse (9) addressed not to soma but to the world-halves  and seemingly extra-hymnic. The two middle verses (4–5) contain the meat of the  hymn: Soma is depicted both as a poet (as in the previous hymn, IX.6.8–9) and a  successful king and warrior. The rest of the hymn (vss. 1–3, 6–8) depicts the usual  journey of the soma around the fleece filter and into the wooden vessel in which  he mixes with water. The final two verses of the hymn proper (7–8) name several  of the divine recipients of soma; those in verse 7 are especially associated with the  Morning Pressing.

As noted in the published introduction, the word sóma- does not appear in this hymn. The word is also absent from IX.3, though there the omnipresence of pávamāna- and other forms of √pū takes up the slack. In this hymn pávamāna- is found only once, in vs. 5.
