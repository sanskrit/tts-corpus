Soma Pavamāna  
Kavi Bhārgava  
5 verses: gāyatrī  
The next three hymns (IX.47–49) are attributed to Kavi Bhārgava, to whom the  Anukramaṇī also credits the five Jagatī hymns IX.75–79. The Soma of this hymn is  distinctly militant, using the power he has acquired (vs. 1) to destroy the Dasyus (vs.  2) and win spoils, as Indra’s very mace (vss. 3, 5). But the same Soma is both a poet  (vs. 4) and a recipient of poetry (vs. 3), who facilitates the human poet’s acquisition  of treasure from his patron (vs. 4).
