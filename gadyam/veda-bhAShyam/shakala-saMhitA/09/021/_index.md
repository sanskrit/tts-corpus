Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāsyapa  
7 verses: gāyatrī  
For most of its length this hymn is a conventional depiction of the flowing of the  soma drops and of the benefits that attend it. Verses 5 and 6, however, which are  constructed in parallel, introduce twists of imagery. Addressed to the soma drops,  the verses urge them to instruct the ungenerous man—presumably a patron who does not distribute the appropriate priestly gifts at the soma sacrifice. In verse 6 the  drops are commanded to set their own will to this task, as a craftsman sets a new  chariot part, probably a wheel. In verse 5 they are meant to set “the tawny tracker”  in an unspecified being or thing (“in this one”); although the referents for both have  been variously identified, we believe that the tawny tracker is Soma himself, and  Indra, already mentioned in verse 1, is the desired location.
