‘ अधि यत्' इति पञ्चर्चं नवमं सूक्तमाङ्गिरसस्य कण्वस्यार्षम् । तथानुक्रम्यते---- अधि यत्कण्वः' इति । पूर्ववच्छन्दोदेवते । गतो विनियोगः ॥

94 (806)  
Soma Pavamāna  
Kaṇva Ghaura  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The word sóma does not appear until the last pāda (5d) of this hymn, which plots a  sometimes difficult course to this ending. The hymn features similes that exploit idi omatic ambiguity to produce different meanings in the simile proper and the frame  (see esp. vss. 1 and 3) and by obscure turns of phrase (see esp. 4d). It is therefore  not surprising that, as in IX.92, Soma is identified as a kaví, a poet, enmeshed in  poetry (vs. 3), and the main focus of the hymn, especially in the first three verses,  is the interchange between the poetic products of the mortal participants in ritual  and those of Soma himself.
