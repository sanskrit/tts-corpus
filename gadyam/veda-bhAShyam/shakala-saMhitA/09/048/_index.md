Soma Pavamāna  
Kavi Bhārgava  
5 verses: gāyatrī  
The poet begins his hymn with a request for benefit, though a rather generic one (vs.  1). The militant theme of the previous hymn is visible in verse 2, while the story of  the falcon’s theft of Soma from heaven, a myth not prominent elsewhere in Maṇḍala  IX, is the subject of verses 3–4. Unlike most of the gāyatrī soma hymns, this one  contains no explicit reference to the preparation of the soma, with only a glancing  mention of the “impelling” of soma in the final verse (5), a term generally used in IX  of the push that starts the soma on its purificatory journey through the filter.

As noted in the published introduction, vss. 3-4 concern the stealing of Soma from heaven (“Somaraub”), a story not otherwise characteristic of IX but treated in detail in IV.26-27. I now think it possible that vss. 1-2 also allude to the same myth, though very obliquely.

Details in the comm. to the relevant vss. Our poet, Kavi Bhārgava, also treats this myth in IX.77, one of his Jagatī hymns.
