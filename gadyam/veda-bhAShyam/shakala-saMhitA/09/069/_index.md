Soma Pavamāna  
Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa  
10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10  
Attributed to the same poet as the author of the famous Indra hymn I.32 (and  indeed I.31–35, as well as IX.4), this hymn is dense with ever-shifting imagery,  expressed in many forms: similes, metaphors, identifications. Sometimes several ref erents are simultaneously possible, as in verse 1, where both “thought” and “soma”  could be the subject of the middle part of the verse. This verbal richness is quite  appropriate, since at least the first two verses concern the poetic impulse; note the  nice description of the tongue as “the gladdening goad” in 2b.  
The middle verses (3–7) treat Soma’s journey across the filter to meet and mix  with the cows/milk. This mixture is described in increasingly elaborate images of  clothing in verses 4–5, ending with the cosmos as his garment (5cd). The journey is  completed in the first half of verse 7, and the hymn comes to a more conventional  ending with prayers for goods and aid.

The theme of these three hymns, particularly insistent in the first and last, is the difference between and ultimate unity of earthly and heavenly Soma.
