Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
7 verses: gāyatrī  
This hymn begins very like the last one, with the rushing of the soma juices, but  goes in a different direction. Verse 2 introduces the Āyus, men both of the past (so  vs. 2, also IX.10.6) and of the present, who are regularly credited with the prepara tion of the soma in the IXth Maṇḍala and by this very poet (IX.10.6, 15.7, 16.8,  19.3). But surprisingly in verse 4 the Āyus are identified with the soma juices, a  rhetorical strategy that must result from the fact that in this verse the juices purify  themselves into the exhilarating drink; in other words they prepare themselves and  therefore behave like the Āyus who prepare the soma.  
In the last three verses (5–7) Soma’s relationship to Indra becomes the focus: in  verse 5 the rushing soma acquires the power of Indra as its essence, and in verses  6 and 7 this power is transferred to Indra, to perform his heroic deeds, both in the  past and in the present. Verse 7 thus harkens back to the ancient Āyus and their  newer path in verse 2.
