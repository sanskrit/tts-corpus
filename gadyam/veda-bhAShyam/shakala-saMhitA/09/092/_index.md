Soma Pavamāna  
Kaśyapa Mārīca  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
Like many hymns in the IXth Maṇḍala this hymn describes Soma’s journey, but  here the focus is on the endpoint, on Soma’s reaching his goal and taking his seat  in the vessels: the “seat” theme is found in three of the six verses (2, 3, 6). Soma is also a poet (vs. 2) and surrounded by poetry (vs. 3). It is this association with the  kaví, the sage poet and master of words, that probably prompted the most striking  statement in the hymn, that all the gods are “in your secret” (vs. 4). This statement  comes in the middle of the hymn and may constitute a weak omphalos, especially  as it is embedded in a series of verses that play with numbers (2–4), often a sign of  an omphalos structure.
