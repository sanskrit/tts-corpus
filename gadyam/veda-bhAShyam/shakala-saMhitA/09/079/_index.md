Soma Pavamāna  
Kavi Bhārgava  
5 verses: jagatī  
The combative spirit of this hymn is reminiscent of that in other hymns attributed  to Kavi Bhārgava, especially IX.47 and IX.76. The hymn is especially interesting  because of the light it throws on social divisions in the R̥gvedic period. The word arí (vss. 1, 3), here translated “stranger” following Thieme (1938), is a much-discussed  and much-contested one, underlying as it does derivatives such as ā́rya “Ārya.”  We are of the opinion that an arí is a member of the larger Ārya society, but not  of one’s immediate community. He is thus a stranger, but one with whom one in  principle shares social values and to whom one owes certain reciprocal duties, such  as hospitality. But as a stranger he may also pose a threat to the smaller community  one belongs to, if he exhibits hostility rather than a communal spirit. The scenario  sketched in this hymn involves the latter type of arí, whose hostility menaces the  success of our sacrifice (vs. 1). Verse 3 is quite explicit about the affinity of the  arí: he is “one of our own,” while a person who does not belong to the larger Ārya  society is called a “wolf,” an outlaw, when his actions threaten us. The poet calls on  Soma to destroy both types of enemies.  
Verse 4 provides a brief interlude, outlining the cosmic dimensions of Soma— from heaven to earth, where his “fingers,” the shoots of the plant, grow—and a few  details of the preparation, vividly rendered. This verse cleverly incorporates four  different body parts (navel, fingers, skin, and hands) each belonging to a different entity. The final verse summarizes the process of pressing and calls once more for  Soma to display his feistiness on our behalf.
