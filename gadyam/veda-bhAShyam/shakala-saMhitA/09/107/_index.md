Soma Pavamāna  
Seven Seers  
26 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas, except dvipadā virāj bhurij 3 and dvipadā virāj 16 as supplemental verses to the preceding pragātha  
This long hymn mostly stays focused the usual themes of the IXth Maṇḍala: the  pressing of Soma, his journey across the filter, his entry into the waters, his mixing  with cows’ milk, and his arrival at his destination, the wooden cups. Interspersed1354 IX.107  
are references to Soma’s cosmic aspect (e.g., the heavenly udder in vs. 5) and cos mic deeds (e.g., making the sun mount in heaven, vs. 7). Especially prominent in  the middle and late parts of the hymn are mentions of the sea (vss. 9, 14, 15, 16,  21, 23), referring both to the waters that the soma enters and to the expanse of  soma itself.  
Toward the end the hymn takes a slightly personal turn, in the pragātha of verses  19–20, where the poet celebrates his fellowship with Soma and, by implication, the  mental state he achieves from drinking the soma. In particular, 20cd “We have flown  like birds far past the sun...” recalls several famous 1st-person descriptions of soma’s  effects: VIII.48.3 “We have drunk the soma; we have become immortal; we have gone to  the light; we have found the gods” and X.119, the Laba-sūkta, in which the soma-drinker  flies through the cosmos, describing his bird’s eye view of heaven and earth.
