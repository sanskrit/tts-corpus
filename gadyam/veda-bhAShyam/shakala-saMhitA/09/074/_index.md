‘शिशुर्न' इति नवर्चं सप्तमं सूक्तं दैर्घतमसस्य कक्षीवत आर्षं पवमानसोमदेवताकम् । अष्टमी त्रिष्टुप् शिष्टा जगत्यः । तथा चानुक्रम्यते- शिशुर्न कक्षीवांस्त्रिष्टुबष्टमी' इति । गतः सूक्तविनियोगः ॥

74 (786)  
Soma Pavamāna  
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa  
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8  
This hymn is attributed to Kakṣīvant, the skilled and crafty poet of I.116–126,  who names himself in verse 8. Although it is not as intricate as some of his Ist  Maṇḍala productions, it invites the same sort of double readings as the previous  

hymn (IX.73) and achieves this ambiguity by the same means, the suppression of  overt referential subjects and objects. It is notable that the word sóma appears only  twice (and only toward the end, vss. 7 and 9) and derivatives of the root pū “purify”  only in the final verse.  
The primary doubled reference arises from the identification of soma with rain.  Particularly in the central verses 4–6 the entities and actions described can apply to  either or both; for example, the men “pissing down” the unnamed substance in 4d  may either be the Maruts producing rain or the priests producing soma. Toward the  end the discourse becomes more clearly somian, and these are the verses in which  the words “soma” and “self-purifying” appear.

Curiously, a much translated hymn, found in Doniger 121-24, Maurer 85-88, despite its difficulties.
