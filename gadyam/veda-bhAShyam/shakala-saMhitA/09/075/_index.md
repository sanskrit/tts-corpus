Soma Pavamāna  
Kavi Bhārgava  
5 verses: jagatī  
Soma’s deep, almost reflexive, involvement in verbal products and production is  the subject of the first two verses of the hymn. He strengthens himself on his own  names in verse 1, and in verse 2 is both the physical (tongue, speaker) and concep tual (father) source of truth and insight. In the second half of verse 2, in the sort of  paradox much beloved by R̥gvedic seers, he not only knows the hidden names but  as son bestows them on his parents.  
The remaining three verses are more conventionally concerned with the prepara tion of the ritual soma, though his connection with cosmic entities remains clear,  especially in verse 4.  
This hymn and the four following (IX.75–70) are attributed to the same poet as  the gāyatrī hymns IX.47–49.
