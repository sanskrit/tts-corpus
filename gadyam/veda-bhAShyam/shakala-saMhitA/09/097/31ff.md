As noted in the published introduction, the tṛca divisions seem to continue in this 2nd half of the composite hymn, although the Anukr. attributes the remaining vss. to just two poets, Parāśara Śāktya (31-44) and Kutsa Āṅgirasa (45-58), an apporioning that does not conform to the presumed tṛca division (splitting the tṛca 43-45 between the two). Both poets are known from elsewhere: Parāśara Śāktya is the poet of I.65- 73 and Kutsa Āṅgirasa of I.94-98 and I.101-15.
