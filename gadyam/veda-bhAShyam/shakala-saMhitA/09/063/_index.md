Soma Pavamāna  
Nidhruvi Kāśyapa  
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
Like the last hymn, this one is much concerned with the ritual preparation of soma,  but it sketches a larger conceptual world in which this preparation takes place. On the  one hand, the purification is seen as a process of Ārya-ization (vs. 5), and the spaces  that Soma traverses, for example the filter, become “Ārya domains” (vs. 14). The waters  that Soma crosses (vss. 5, 21) and the rivers in which he is groomed (vs. 17) are both  the ritual waters in which the soma plant is rinsed and rehydrated and, metaphorically,  the frontier rivers the Āryas crossed in expanding their realms. (See also the mentions  of finding or making “wide space” in the two preceding hymns [IX.61.12; 62.3, 9].)  
On the other hand, Soma is compared to and identified with the Sun (espe cially in the third tr̥ca, vss. 7–9, also vs. 13), and his journey across the filter is also  metaphorically the Sun’s daily journey across the heaven. Since the ritual activity  happens on earth, at the hands of Manu (vss. 7–8), the first sacrificer and the cul tural ancestor of the Ārya, even the rising of the Sun is thus implicitly attributed  to human agency.  
The hymn is, of course, also full of requests for material goods of all sorts, and,  especially toward the end, for Soma to smite all manner of enemies and hostile  forces (vss. 24, 26, 28–29; also 5).  
Although the hymn does not seem tightly structured, some tr̥cas show formal  unity (e.g., vss. 25–27 with forms of the root sr̥j “surge”), and the hymn begins and  ends with verses containing the imperative dhāraya “secure, sustain.”

On the place of these long hymns in the structure of the maṇḍala, see published introduction. to IX.61. All of these hymns consist of collections of tṛcas of varying degrees of cohesion. In fact, it is surprising how few tṛcas display a real attempt at thematic or lexical unity, and what they do show is often simply the byproduct of the fact that both the lexicon and thematic preoccupations of Maṇḍala IX are comparatively limited and so similar words and themes are not unlikely to show up in adjacent verses. This lack of unity contrasts, I think (this is my unsystematic and anecdotal impression) with collections of tṛcas in other maṇḍalas, notably VIII.</details>
