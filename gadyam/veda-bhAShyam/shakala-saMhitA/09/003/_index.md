Soma Pavamāna  
Śunaḥśepa Ājiīgarti  
10 verses: gāyatrī  
Following the pattern set by IX.1–2, the Anukramaṇī gives as the poet of  this hymn the author of the third collection of hymns in Maṇḍala I  (24–30),  Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti, also the protagonist of the famous Aitareya Brāhmaṇa story  of father/son sacrifice (AiB VII.13–18), related during the Rājasūya, the Royal  Consecration.  
The hymn is verbally unified by the “this (one)” (eṣá), which begins every verse.  It is thematically unified by its focus on only one step of the preparation, the filter ing through sheep’s wool that is the self-purification proper. A form of the verb  “purify oneself” appears in seven of the ten verses (and “filter” derived from the  same root in an eighth; only vss. 1 and 6 lack such a form). The poet provides vari ety with a range of images, from the bird of verse 1 to the chariot rider in verse 5,  and as is common he conflates, and equates, the ritual and cosmic spheres. So, for  example, the filter across which the soma moves is both a tangle of wool (vs. 2) and  the vast spaces of heaven and the atmosphere (vs. 7).

As discussed in the published introduction, this hymn is unified by a simple device, the nom. sg.

m. prn/pronominal adj. eṣá ‘this (one)’ that opens each vs. The first three vss. (and vs. 5) begin eṣá deváḥ; in a further two vss. (7, 8) the 2nd word divám is, of course, etymologically related to devá- and a phonological variant (i for e in the initial syllable). Only vss. 4, 6, 9, and 10 stand aside from this pattern -- and 6 and 9 have deváḥ in their 2nd pādas. The final vs., 10, opens eṣá u syá “this one here, this very one,” producing an emphatic summary with the addition of a 2nd prn.

As was also noted in the published introduction, the maṇḍala’s signature word ‘purify oneself’ is also omnipresent in this hymn, esp. the nom. sg. pres. part. pávamāna- ‘purifying himself’, which opens the pāda in vss. 2(c), 3(b), 4(c), 5(b), 7(c), 8(c); pavítre is found (mid-pāda) in 9, and once again vs. 10 marks a change and a summary, by using the finite form pavate (mid-c). Only vss. 1 and 6 lack a form of √pū. It might be worthy of note (if we understood how this maṇḍala had been assembled) that this flurry of repetitions is the first appearance of the part. pávamāna- in this maṇḍala. The over-abundance of forms of √pū may balance the lack of any overt mention of sóma-.

It can also be noted that the hymn is entirely in the 3rd ps.
