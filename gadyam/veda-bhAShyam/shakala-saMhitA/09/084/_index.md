‘ पवस्व देवमादनः' इति पञ्चर्चं सप्तदशं सूक्तं वाचः पुत्रस्य प्रजापतेरार्षं जागतं पवमानसोमदेवताकम् । तथा चानुक्रान्तं- पवस्व वाच्यः प्रजापतिः' इति । गतो विनियोगः ॥

Soma Pavamāna  
Prajāpati Vācya  
5 verses: jagatī  
Unlike the last hymn, this one concentrates on the preparation of the soma, and,  although he has a cosmic dimension (see esp. vs. 2), it is always clear that Soma is  the topic and the referent. The most interesting image is found in verse 2, where  Soma “performs the knotting and unknotting.” On the ritual level, this phrase  probably refers to Soma’s journey through the tangle of sheep’s wool on the filter,  but comparison with IX.97.18 suggests that it also has moral force, with Soma  separating and distinguishing the straight way from the crooked one.
