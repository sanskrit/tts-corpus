Soma Pavamāna  
Medhyātithi Kāṇva  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
The double affiliation of Soma with the ritual and cosmic realms leads off the  hymn: in verse 1 he performs major cosmogonic deeds while participating in his  ritual preparation, mixing with milk and being washed in water. This twofold theme  continues through the hymn, as, for example, in verse 4 where Soma begets the gods  while being poured in the filter. The hymn ends (vs. 6) with a wish for the same  material benefits found in the preceding hymn, IX.41.4.
