Soma Pavamāna  
Prabhūvasu Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
The hymn begins with a noble image of Soma as a racehorse racing to the finish,  and the second verse contains another equine comparison, though with a more  lowly type of horse. This theme is abandoned until the final verse (6), when Soma  goes seeking horses for the worshipers. The hymn is otherwise a fairly standard  soma hymn, though one might note that the connection of soma with light made in  the previous hymn (attributed to the same poet), IX.35.1, is also found here in verse  3. Also, every verse but the last contains a form derived from the root pū “purify,”  always pāda-initial.

As noted in the published introduction, every vs. but the final one has a form of √pū ‘purify’ beginning a pāda (though, interestingly, never the vs.), with each one different: 1b pavítre, 2b pávasva, 3b pávamāna, 4c pávate, 5c pávatām. This pattern is reminiscent of the “versified paradigm” of the first hymn in the RV, I.1. And the abrupt cessation of the pattern in the last vs. is of course also typical of RVic style.
