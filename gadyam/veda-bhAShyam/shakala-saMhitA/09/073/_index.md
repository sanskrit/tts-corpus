Soma Pavamāna  
Pavitra Āṅgirasa  
9 verses: jagatī  
A complex and enigmatic hymn, whose difficulties stem primarily from the double  system of reference that pervades the hymn. The signature phrase is “they have  sounded in unison” (sám asvaran, vss. 1, 4, 5, 6); in none of its occurrences is there  an overt subject, an omission that is surely deliberate. The verb forms in ques  
tion, and indeed most of the hymn, can be interpreted as referring either to the  soma streams as they noisily cross the filter or to the priests/poets who provide  the hymns that accompany soma’s journey. This double reference is found even in  the name of the poet to whom the hymn is attributed: Pavitra (“Filter”): the filter  is both the sheep’s wool filter that purifies the soma and the poet who creates the  ritual speech; the word pavítra occurs several times in the hymn (vss. 3, 7, 8, 9, and  implicitly 4). The “solution” to the central riddle of the hymn, this dual reference,  is suggested in the first half of verse 7 and definitely expressed in the final verse  (9), where “the thread of truth” (r̥tásya tántuḥ) is stretched both on the filter and  on the tongue-tip. The thread may be both the track of the soma across the filter  and the continuous line of speech. The second half of the verse emphasizes the  importance of united action to attain it, and the necessity of always advancing.  
Another thematic strain is the deployment of the power of this unified sound  against enemies and hostile forces (see esp. vss. 5, 6, 8), a power associated with  Varuṇa and his māyā́ (“magic power, artifice,” vss. 5 and 9), with whom Soma is  identified, first in verse 3.  Varuṇa is of course the protector of commandments  (vratá, vss. 3, 5, 8) and is associated with truth/true speech (r̥tá, vss. 1, 6, 8, 9), words  prominent in the hymn. Thus, Soma, as the embodiment of Varuṇa, and the poets  who assist him can marshal Varuṇa’s weapon, “true speech,” against forces that  deny or attempt to thwart it.  
Many individual puzzles remain, but the overall structure and purpose of the  hymn are clear.

On the key to this hymn, see published introduction. Oldenberg argues that it is a hymn for rain, but I don’t see that (nor does Geldner), despite the presence of Varuṇa. Both Geldner and Oldenberg properly remark on the repeated phrase sám asvaran.
