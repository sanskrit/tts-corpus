Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
This hymn, which shares a number of themes with IX.9, begins with three verses  heavy with similes, quickly sketching the pressing, filtering, and mixing of the soma  juices. After a verse (4)  with no poetic figuration, the second part of the hymn  switches to metaphor, and especially to metaphors of and identifications with the  sun, as in IX.9. The spreading of the soma juices across the sheep’s fleece is likened  to suns and their rays (vs. 5). The “lone one” in verse 7 is probably both the soma  crossing the filter and the sun crossing heaven. Soma’s eye is first tied to the sun (vs.  8), and then the sun implicitly becomes his eye (vs. 9). In addition, the “portion” of  Vivasvant (“the one shining forth”) and of Dawn in verse 5 probably refers to the  radiance of these divinities, obtained by the soma juices, which are then transformed  into suns.  
Other metaphors involve the poets and sacrificers: the doors of poetry (vs. 6), the  seven siblings of the priests (vs. 7), who are no doubt the seven inspired thoughts of  previous hymns (IX.9.4, 6; IX.8.4). This latter metaphor of kinship then provides  our own kinship relationship to Soma himself (vs. 8). One image remains somewhat  obscure: in verse 9 the “track of heaven” is said to have been placed in hiding by the  Adhvaryus. This must be a specific ritual reference, with the track of heaven being  likened to Soma’s own tracks—perhaps when Soma disappears into the fleece when  the Adhvaryu priests are first pressing him.
