‘य इन्दोः' इति चतुर्ऋचमेकादशं सूक्तम् । ऋष्याद्याः: पूर्ववत् । तथा चानुक्रम्यते -- य इन्दोश्चतुष्कम्' इति । गतः सूक्तविनियोगः ॥

Soma Pavamāna  
Kaśyapa Mārīca  
4 verses: paṅkti  
This final hymn in the Soma Maṇḍala has the feeling of an afterthought. The seer  addresses himself in verse 2, and the fortunate ritualist depicted in verse 1 is most  likely Kaśyapa as well. In verse 3 he produces a triad of heptads, which have little to  do with his call to Soma to protect us (3d). The final verse (4) repeats this call and  enlarges on the dangers we wish to avoid.
