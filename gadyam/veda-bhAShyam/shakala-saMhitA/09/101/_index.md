101 (813)  
Soma Pavamāna  
Andhīgu Śyāvāśvi (1–3), Yayāti Nāhuṣa (4–6), Nahuṣa Mānava (7–9), Manu  Sāṃvaraṇa (10–12), Prajāpati (13–16)  
16 verses: anuṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 2–3, arranged in trcas ̥  
In order to conform to the pattern of arrangement, this last hymn in the anuṣṭubh  group must actually have consisted originally of five three-verse hymns, with a single  verse (16) appended, as was already pointed out by Oldenberg (1888: 201). There is,  however, some interconnection among the tr̥cas that points to a sense of cohesion.  In particular, the first and last tr̥cas (vss. 1–3 and 13–15) are linked by the striking  image in their first verses (1, 13) of a sacrifice-defiling dog drawn to the sound of  the soma being pressed, a dog that must be driven away. Verse 13 also contains a  brief and enigmatic allusion to a myth also enigmatically mentioned to in X.171.2.  
Most of the rest of the hymn contains standard material: the details of prepara tion of the drink and its journey across the filter to mix with the milk, as well as its  relationship to the gods, especially Indra. There is some internal unity visible in the  individual tr̥cas, but it is not pronounced.

On the division of this hymn into tṛcas and the structure of the hymn in general see published introduction. The Anukramaṇī assigns each tṛca to a different poet, in roughly reverse (conceptual) chronological order. The last tṛca plus appended vs., vss. 13-16, is credited to Prajāpati, the Middle Vedic creator god, with no patronymic. The poet of the 2nd to last tṛca, vss. 10-12, is given as Manu Sāṃvaraṇa. This poet is in fact referred to, with the patryonymic Sāṃvaraṇi, in the first Vālakhilya hymn, VIII.51.1 yáthā mánau sāṃvaraṇau, sómam indrā́pibaḥ sutám “Just as at Manu Sāṃvaraṇi's you drank pressed soma, Indra …” But even if the reference is just to a revered ancient poet, the name Manu, as the ur-man and ursacrificer, resonates in the context of Prajāpati. Moreover, there’s a missing step: the Anukr. attributes V.33-34 to one Saṃvaraṇa Prājāpatya, who would be the gapped generational link between Prajāpati and Manu Sāṃvaraṇa (/i). The names of the next two poets display the proper generational relationship: the third tṛca from the end (vss. 7-9) is by Nahuṣa Mānava, with his patronymic from Manu; the fourth tṛca from the end (vss. 4-6) by Yayāti Nāhuṣa, again taking his patronymic from the next poet in order. The first tṛca (vss. 1-3) does not participate in this generational chain; it is attributed to Andhīgu Śyāvāśvi, a patronymic that links him to the skilled poet of the Marut hymns of V (52-61), Śyāvāśva Ātreya (for further on this attribution see comm. ad vs. 1 below). Leaving Andhīgu aside, it seems that the Anukr. takes the hymn from a presumably contemporary poet Yayāti back through the ages (and 4-5 generations) to the primal god Prajāpati, whose primacy is signaled by his lack of patronymic.
