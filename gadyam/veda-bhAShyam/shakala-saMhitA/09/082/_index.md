Soma Pavamāna  
Vasu Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5  
The first two verses of this hymn are conventional treatments of Soma’s journey  across the filter and his mixing with milk (here called ghee). Verse 3, however, is more  cryptically phrased, and the name Soma is not mentioned. He appears as a buffalo  with feathers and/or leaves, and his father is Parjanya (“thunder”): the image is of a  plant produced by the rains. As often, his home is in the mountains, here identified  as the navel of the earth. And the rinsing waters, the milk, and the pressing stones  of the ritual preparation appear in the second half of the verse. Verse 4 is notable  for its 1st-person singular speaker; the abrupt phrase “Listen:  I  am speaking to  you” is reminiscent of the famous command given by the goddess Speech (Vāc) in  X.125.4 “Listen to me, you who are listened to. It’s a trustworthy thing I tell you.”  First-person singular speech is quite rare in Maṇḍala IX. The combination of a rid dling middle verse and the poet’s announcement of his own speech is reminiscent of  omphalos hymns, though there is little other support for such a structure.
