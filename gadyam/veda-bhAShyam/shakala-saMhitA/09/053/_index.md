53 (765)  
Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verse: gāyatrī  
The next eight hymns (IX.53–60) are attributed to the same poet as V.44, a hymn  to the All Gods often declared to be the hardest hymn in the R̥gveda. Although  these brief soma hymns have some interesting features, they lack the mind-boggling  verbal pyrotechnics of that hymn.  
On the other hand, the organizing principle of V.44 is the double application of  each verse to two different divinities, Agni and Soma, with a lexicon ambiguous  enough to allow both interpretations. Something of the same thing is visible in this  hymn, in which each verse but the last (4) invites the audience to supply a refer  
ent different from the one meant. The first verse deploys clear Indraic vocabulary,  particularly the vocative “possessor of the stone,” though Soma can, and should,  be its subject. The first two-thirds of the second verse (2ab) suggest either Indra or  Soma as referent, until the 1st singular verb form “I will praise” that opens the last  pāda establishes the 1st-person speaker as the referent. Again, the third verse opens  like a verse to Varuṇa or another Āditya, and only the “self-purifying” that begins  the second pāda ties it to Soma. It is only the last verse that contains unmistakable  somian vocabulary and which, in its final pāda, clarifies the roles of the drop (índu)  and Indra.

The next 8 hymns, the last ones before the lengthy hymns assembled from tṛcas (IX.61-68) that end the dimeter collection, are attributed to Avatsāra Kāśyapa. All of them contain four vss., and a number of them are structured such that the first three vss. form a unity, with the last vs. stylistically or thematically contrastive or completive. See esp.

IX.53-57. Oldenberg tends to analyze them as a tṛca with Schlussvers, which is strictly accurate, but I think the point is the interplay of 3+1.
