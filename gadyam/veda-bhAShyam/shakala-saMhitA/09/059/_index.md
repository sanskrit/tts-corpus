59 (771)  
Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
Each of the four verses contains at least one form of “purify oneself/self-purifying,”  with three such imperatives in verse 2. That verse seems to contain a trio of elemental  substances, which are also connected with the ritual: waters, plants, and, in our interpre tation, the hearths as holy places, representative of fire. Soma as finder of good things  for us provides a thematic ring for the hymn; in verse 1 he finds the material and psy chological goods men desire, while in verse 4 he has raised the stakes to the cosmic level.

The next 8 hymns, the last ones before the lengthy hymns assembled from tṛcas (IX.61-68) that end the dimeter collection, are attributed to Avatsāra Kāśyapa. All of them contain four vss., and a number of them are structured such that the first three vss. form a unity, with the last vs. stylistically or thematically contrastive or completive. See esp.

IX.53-57. Oldenberg tends to analyze them as a tṛca with Schlussvers, which is strictly accurate, but I think the point is the interplay of 3+1.
