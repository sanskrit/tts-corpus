Agni  
Pūru Ātreya  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5  
This and the following hymn are attributed to the same poet, and indeed the two  hymns show many parallels: they have the same meter and the same number of  verses, and their concluding pāda is identical. Geldner notes that this hymn, like  many of the Agni hymns of this maṇḍala, uses rare and affected expressions.  Certainly the syntax in this hymn is challenging, especially in verses 3–4, whose  complex construction marks the climax of the hymn. The two verses describe the  point at which Agni is burning most brightly. At that moment he has become the  powerful ally and benefactor of the sacrificers, and at that moment Agni shines  beyond both heaven and earth.  
Both in these verses and elsewhere in the hymn the poet emphasizes the alliance  among Agni, the priests, and their patrons. In verse 1, for example, the expression  mitráṃ ná compares Agni to Mitra, the god of alliances, and simultaneously com pares him to a mitrá, an ally. The first is the primary sense, as it is elsewhere, here  especially because the hymn refers to Bhaga, another of the Ādityas, in verse 2.
