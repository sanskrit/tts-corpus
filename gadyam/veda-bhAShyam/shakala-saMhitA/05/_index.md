### Sages  
Only fourteen of the eighty-seven hymns of the maṇḍala are attributed or alter nately attributed to Atri himself (V.27, 37–43, 76–77, 83–86). The majority of the  hymns were composed by Ātreyas, descendants of Atri, thirty-six of whom are  mentioned by the Anukramaṇī in Maṇḍala V.  In the Anukramaṇī’s reckoning,  only three of the Ātreyas— Vasuśruta (3–6), Sutambhara (11–14), and Śyāvāśva  (52–59, 81–82)—composed more than one or two hymns, and only Atri himself,  Śyāvāśva, and Avasyu Ātreya (31, 75) provided hymns to more than one deity or  set of deities in this book. 

Unlike, for example, Maṇḍala III, the Viśvāmitra Family  Book, the eponymous poet is thus not the major poet of Maṇḍala V. Rather, Atri  is principally an ancestor, perhaps a fairly distant one, of a large family of poets.  Atri appears as a figure in hymns by Ātreyas (2, 7, 15, 73, 74, 78) and in one hymn  of his own (40), sometimes in reference to narratives associated with him, such  as his rescue by the Aśvins (73.6, 78.4) or Atri’s restoration of the sun (40.6–8).  In final verses poets occasionally refer to themselves and their people as “Atris”  (22.4, 39.5, 40.9, 67.5)—a plural that only occurs in the Vth Maṇḍala. 

In addition  to Atri and Ātreyas, there are other poets from families connected to the Atris in  some way. Among them are Āṅgirasa poets, to whom two hymns (15, 35) are attributed. The Āṅgirasa poets are one of the two dominant families in VIII, which also  contains seven hymns ascribed to Ātreya poets (or in the case of VIII.91, a female  [Ātreyī] poet). The presence of Āṅgirasa poets in V and of Ātreya poets in VIII  points to the close connection between Atri poets and the Kāṇvas and Āṅgirasas.+++(4)+++ 
 
Geographically, the Atris ranged broadly from the rivers in the northwest, including the Kabul (Kubhā) and Kurram (Krumu) rivers, extending to the Yamunā in the  east.+++(5)+++ Strikingly, it is the same poet, Śyāvāśva, who mentions rivers in the northwest  (53.9) and the Yamunā (52.17).  

### Gods  
The Atris and their associates address a broader range of deities in their hymns  than do many of the other poetic families. The distribution is as follows:  Agni  (1–28), Indra (29–40), the All Gods (41–51), the Maruts (52–61), Mitra and Varuṇa  (62–72), the Aśvins (73–78), Dawn (79–80), Savitar (81–82), Parjanya (83), Earth  (84), Varuṇa (85), Indra and Agni (86), and the Maruts (87). 

The last hymn, which  returns to the Maruts, is an addition to the original collection and unusual in a  number of respects. Metrically it is in a long lyric meter, and thematically it features  an unusual pairing of the Maruts with Viṣṇu.  

The Atri Maṇḍala contains a noteworthy collection of hymns to the All Gods  (41–51). A number of these feature riddles and verbal play, but none is as challenging as V.44, which Geldner called the most difficult hymn in the R̥gveda.+++(5)+++ The hymn  does not name the god or gods it praises, but the very last verse mentions Agni and  Soma, leaving the hearer to divine what the rest of the hymn is about. Complicating  that task are lexical, syntactic, and morphological puzzles, ellipses without obvious resolution, and, above all, a likely dual reference that points to the mystery at the  heart of the hymn.  

The Marut cycle attributed to Śyāvāśva Ātreya (52–61) contains the longest  sequence of hymns dedicated to these gods in the R̥gveda and is a remarkably exciting and satisfying achievement. Other hymns of note include two  hymns to gods of the natural world, V.80 to Dawn and V.83 to Parjanya, the  Thunderstorm. The first is the most famous and certainly one of the most beautiful of the hymns to Dawn in the R̥gveda, famed for its sensual portrayal of  Dawn as a beautiful woman revealing herself to men. The latter is an energetic  picture of the storm god, roaring loudly and flooding the earth. The rains are a  constant theme in a number of the strongest hymns in this collection+++(4)+++, including  V.54, which vividly describes the Maruts and the storms they bring, and V.63,  which rumbles repeated sounds in its praise of Mitra and Varuṇa as masters  of the monsoons. The single hymn to Varuṇa in this collection, V.85, presents  both a grand vision of the god as the creator of the world and a more intimate  one of Varuṇa as a god who can forgive offenses and free people from them.  In general, the Atri poets were at their best in describing natural phenomena,  especially thunderstorms, which they both fervently desire and fear because of  their power.
