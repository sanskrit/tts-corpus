Agni  
Vavri Ātreya  
5 verses: gāyatrī 1–2, anuṣṭubh 3–4, virāḍrūpā 5  
As other translators have remarked, this hymn is enigmatic. Renou even describes it  as a collection of disjointed verses, and it is true that in its five verses the hymn has  three different meters.  
The first two verses describe the birth of Agni in terms that suggest human birth.  The fire is born from a womb of wood, its first covering, and appears with a caul  of smoke, its second covering. Having emerged, it peeps out from the hollow of  the lower churning stick that gave it birth. Then priests nurture Agni’s growth into  manhood, and perhaps Agni himself, as Geldner suggests, becomes a fortress for  them, or perhaps the sacrificial ground governed by Agni is their fortress.  
In verse 3 it is not clear who Śvaitreya might be. He could be Agni himself,  whose kin would be his flames. Or he might be a clan leader or even, as Geldner  argues, a racing bull. Because the relationship between Br̥haduktha and Śvaitreya is  unclear, it is equally uncertain how to understand the relationship between 3ab and  cd. Br̥haduktha is elsewhere a poet, and although the Anukramaṇī abstracts Vavri  Ātreya as the name of the poet of this hymn from the vavrí “covering” in the first  verse, it is more likely that Br̥haduktha is actually the poet. He is apparently seeking  the prize the way a horse does. Oldenberg points out that in the Vājapeya sacrifice  there is a mantra that invites the horse to drink honey, perhaps to give him strength,  and perhaps this custom lies behind the simile in d. The mystery deepens in verse  4, but it appears that Agni, when he is born, then mates with the two fire-churning  

sticks that give him birth as he consumes them. The act would seem to be unholy,  but that is merely Agni’s deception.  
The last verse apparently describes the fully mature Agni, flinging his flames in  the wind. On this verse, see Hoffmann (1954/61: 46–47 [=1975: 375–76]); he is surely  correct to read sandhr̥ṣájas, which could mean “daring warriors” or the like, instead  of san dhr̥ṣájas with the Padapāṭha.
