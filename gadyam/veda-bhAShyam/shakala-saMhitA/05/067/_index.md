Mitra and Varuṇa  
Yajata Ātreya  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh  
This hymn emphasizes the multiplicity of the Ādityas, which the hymn connects  with their presence in multiple places and their lordship among different peoples  (vss. 2, 4). It invokes the Ādityas in the first verse and then Varuṇa, Mitra, and  Aryaman; in verse 2 just Varuṇa and Mitra, and then in verse 3 Varuṇa, Mitra, and  Aryaman once again. The climax comes in the last verse, which suggests that all  the forms of the Ādityas culminate in Mitra or Varuṇa—or, rather, in the two of  them together. We offer this interpretation tentatively since the key lines are 5ab. As  the parenthetical insertions in our translation indicate, it is not clear precisely how  these lines should be construed.
