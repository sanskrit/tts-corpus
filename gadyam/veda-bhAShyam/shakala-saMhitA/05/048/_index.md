‘ कदु प्रियाय ' इति पञ्चर्चं चतुर्थ सूक्तम् । प्रतिभानुर्नामात्रेय ऋषिः । जगती छन्दः । विश्वे देवा देवता । अत्रानुक्रमणिका -- कदु पञ्च प्रतिभानुर्जागतम्' इति । आभिप्लविके पञ्चमेऽहनि वैश्वदेवशस्त्रे इदं सूक्तं निविद्धानम् । सूत्रितं च - ‘ कदु प्रियायेति वैश्वदेवम्' (आश्व. श्रौ. ७. ७ ) इति ॥

Pratibhānu Ātreya  
5 verses: jagatī  
Another enigmatic hymn, made more baffling (as in a number of All God hymns in  Maṇḍala V) by the lack of named referents for the descriptive phrases. There is cer tainly no consensus among scholars about these referents or about the purpose and  structure of the hymn; indeed, a number of scholars consider this a “fragment.” We  find this unlikely, however. The fact that the most difficult verse by far is the middle  one (3) suggests that this is an omphalos hymn, and moreover the final pāda (of vs.  5) is typical of a hymn ending.  
In our opinion the hymn is appropriate to an early-morning ritual, and the two  main referents are Dawn (/Dawns) and Agni. It begins with a typical rhetorical ques tion: what poem to compose for the establishment of the ritual fire at dawn? The  second half of verse 1 and first half of verse 2 present striking images of dawn  (/dawns) breaking, ending verse 2 with a standard meditation on the aging that  every new day brings to mortals. This thought is continued in verse 3, though the  focus passes to Agni, who day after day at the ritual prepares the mace for Indra  when Indra is present at the sacrifice, while the recurrent dawns mark the passage of  time. Agni as the ritual fire remains the subject of the remainder of the hymn (vss.  4–5), with his identity becoming clearer and clearer.
