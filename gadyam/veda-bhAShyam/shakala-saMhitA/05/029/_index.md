Indra  
Gaurivīti Śāktya  
15 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn consists primarily of a recital of Indra’s great deeds, with special atten tion to the Vr̥tra saga and the Maruts’ role in it (vss. 1–4, 6–9). Interspersed are  verses devoted to two much less understood myths, Indra’s conflict with the Sun in  an apparent chariot race (vss. 5, 9–10) and his journey with Kutsa to Uśanā’s house  and the defeat of Śuṣṇa (vs. 9), myths that often appear together and show narrative  connections. There are as well brief mentions of other exploits of Indra, including  the Vala myth (vs. 12). The story of the Sun’s chariot and the Kutsa/Uśanā complex  are particular preoccupations of the Indra hymns of Maṇḍala V, although the refer ences to them (Sun’s chariot V.31.11, Kutsa/Uśanā V.31.7–10) do not help to clarify  the details as much as we would like.  
The poet several times (vss. 1, 3, 7) mentions Manu, the first Ārya man and sac rificer, in connection with the mythic past. This emphasis on Manu, the theoretical  ancestor of the current sacrificers, is presumably meant to associate those current sacrificers with the participants and supporters of Indra in his previous deeds, in  order to gain a portion of reflected glory. As often, the hymn sometimes narrates  the myths as if in present time (see esp. vss. 1, 6, 12, all three using the same verb  “they chant” [árcanti]). This again is a strategy serving the same purpose, here by  specifically identifying the present singers with both the Maruts and the Aṅgirases.  
The hymn is also structured by recurrent soma-drinking phrases, each slightly  different, almost always in the second half of an even pāda (see 2b, 3b, 3d, 5b, 7d,  8b, 11d), a pattern that provides a sort of rhythmic theme-and-variations.  
It ends with three verses (13–15) in which the poet refers globally to the amaz ing range of Indra’s deeds past and future, and in the final verse offers him his own  well-crafted poems. Only one word in this verse, vasūyúḥ “seeking goods,” out of  the whole hymn, hints that the poet would like something in return.

Indra As noted in the published introduction, the hymn is punctuated by expressions of somadrinking, each slightly different and generally found in the 2nd half of an even pāda: 2b ... papivā́ṃsaṃ sutásya 3b ... sómasya súṣutasya peyāḥ 3d ... papivā́m índro asya [rhyming with 2b] 5b ... somapéyam [cf. 3b] [7d sutám pibat ... sómam] 8b ... somyā́pā́ḥ 11d ... ápibaḥ sómam asya
