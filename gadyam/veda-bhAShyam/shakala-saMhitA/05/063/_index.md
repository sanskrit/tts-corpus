॥ श्रीगणेशाय नमः ॥

यस्य निःश्वसितं वेदा यो वेदेभ्योऽखिलं जगत् ।

निर्ममे तमहं वन्दे विद्यातीर्थमहेश्वरम् ।।

अष्टकस्य चतुर्थस्य तृतीयो व्याकृतः स्फुटम् । ।

अध्यायः सायणायेंण चतुर्थो व्याकरिष्यते ।।

‘ ऋतस्य गोपौ ' इति सप्तर्चं सप्तमं सूक्तम् । अत्रेयमनुक्रमणिका - ‘ ऋतस्य सप्तार्चनाना जागतम्' इति । आत्रेयोऽर्चनाना नाम ऋषिः । जगती छन्दः । तुह्यादिपरिभाषया मित्रावरुणौ देवता । विनियोगो लैङ्गिकः ॥

Mitra and Varuṇa  
Arcanānas Ātreya  
7 verses: jagatī  
Like the previous hymn to Mitra and Varuṇa, this hymn is also a plea for monsoon  rains. It gives a vivid picture of the monsoons with their thunder and lightning (vss.  5, 6) and the coming of the rain (esp. vss. 1, 4). The poet uses sound repetition,  perhaps in imitation of echoing thunder or recurring lightning or perhaps simply  as a demonstration of his poetic ability:  2d...-vī ví caranti..., 3b... vícarṣanī,  3c citrébhir..., 4b carati citrám..., 5c ... citrā́ ví caranti..., 6b... citrā́m vadati  tvíṣī-..., and 7d...-vi cítryam.... Also across 3ab samrā́jā ugrā́ vr̥ṣabhā́ divás pátī,  pr̥thivyā́ mitrā́váruṇā vícarṣaṇī, the two lines have exactly the same metrical struc ture and repeated vowels in the same syllables.  
The hymn several times refers to the māyā́, the “cunning” of Mitra and Varuṇa  (vss. 3, 4, 6, 7), which in its first and last attestations is described as the “cunning of  a lord (ásura)” (vss. 3, 7), thus connecting Mitra and Varuṇa’s ability to control the  rain by their cunning with their kingship. They are likewise twice called “sovereign kings” (samrā́j) (vss. 2, 3). The prefix sám- “together,” signifying their unifying rule,  contrasts with the repeated prefix ví- “apart,” which indicates the diverse things over  which they hold sovereignty. This theme is announced in 2ab, where they are called  samrā́jau over the world vidáthe “in its division.”  
Also translated and discussed in Brereton (1981: 104–6).
