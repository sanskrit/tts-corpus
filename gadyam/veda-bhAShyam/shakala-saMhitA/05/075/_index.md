Aśvins  
Avasyu Ātreya  
9 verses: paṅkti  
Two themes dominate this hymn. One, announced at the beginning of the first verse, is  the chariot of the Aśvins, which conveys the gods to the sacrificial place. The other is  the call of the poet, the theme of the hymn’s refrain. The two are intimately connected,  since the purpose of the poet’s praise is to bring the Aśvins on their chariot to the sac  
rificial ground. In verse 2 the poet imagines the chariot passing by the hymns of other  sacrificers that claim to win the Aśvins and continuing on toward his sacrifice. Because  the hymn is leading the Aśvins toward the poet, the voice of the poet rides on the chariot  (vs. 4), and the Aśvins’ horses are harnessed by the thought of the poet (vs. 6). In 7cd  the Aśvins are invoked to travel tiráś cid “even across,” but it is not clear across what.  Geldner (and others, see Pirart 2001: 290–92) suggests a haplology of *aryáḥ because  of the following aryayā́. In this interpretation, the line could mean “even across what  belongs to the stranger” or “even across the strangers” or the like. By contrast, we inter pret pāda c as a recollection of 2b and therefore supply the phrase “all those ‘I shall  win’-s.” But in either case the Aśvins are again asked not to be seduced by the hymns and  sacrifices of others, but to drive by them, heeding the poet’s summons to his sacrifice.
