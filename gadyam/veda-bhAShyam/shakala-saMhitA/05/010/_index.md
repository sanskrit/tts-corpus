Agni  
Gaya Ātreya  
7 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 4, 7  
Oldenberg (1897: 390) remarks that this hymn “seems to stand parallel with” the  preceding hymn, which is attributed to the same poet. The hymn comprises a direct  and energetic plea for wealth both for those chanting praise songs and for their  patrons, their sūrís, explicitly mentioned in verses 3 and 6. In verse 3 it is not clear  whether “patrons” and “men” refer to patrons and priests or whether “men” is in  apposition to patrons, and then in verse 4, whether those beautifying the songs are  patrons or priests or both. If both, which we think most likely, then the “gifts of  horses” could refer to actual horses that patrons bring and metaphoric horses, the  songs that priests offer.  
The hymn is marked by repeated pointing at Agni as the one who can and  should bring this wealth. So verses 2, 3, and 7 all begin with a 2nd-person pronoun  followed immediately by an address to Agni: “You, o Agni!” In verse 2 there is  a progression from Agni’s will to sacrifice, to his skill to do so, and finally to his  “effective action” in performing the rite, at which point he becomes “worthy of the  sacrifice,” that is, both worthy to perform his priest’s role and worthy to receive  offerings as a god.
