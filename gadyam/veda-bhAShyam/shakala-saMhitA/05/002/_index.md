Agni  
Kumāra Ātreya or Vr̥śa Jāna or both  
12 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 12  
Geldner provides a long introduction to this hymn and concludes that it deals with  the disappearance of the fire-god Agni as if he were a household or ritual fire that  has suddenly gone out or a newly churned or kindled fire that does not emerge.  More specifically, we suggest, it may have been composed as a prāyaścitti or expia  
tion for a sacrificial fire that has gone out as offerings were poured into it and to  accompany a rite of restoring the fire.  
In verses 1–2 the hidden child is Agni. The young mother (vs. 1) and wet nurse  (vs. 2) could be the firewood (samídh fem.) that keeps the fire hidden, and the chief  wife, the máhiṣī, who gave birth to Agni, may be a fire-churning stick (aráṇī fem.).  Yet in verse 1 the poet assures himself that Agni will emerge and take his ritual  place to the east as he usually does. The poet sees Agni far away from his place  in the rite (vss. 3–4), but who is this Agni? Is he other fires, or, as we think more  likely, the sun, moving from the east toward the west? Verse 5 offers syntactic chal  
lenges—the masculine yéṣām and the sense of ná ... cid—but the cattle or bulls of  Agni that it mentions may be the flames (arká or arcí masc.?) that the poets hopes  the god will drive to the sacrificial place. Agni should find release from the powers  who would deny the fire to the poet and his peoples (vs. 6), and thus should release  the sacrificers from whatever limits them (vs. 7). However, Agni has departed the  sacrificial place in anger—a fact that one of the gods, perhaps Indra or Varuṇa  or conceivably even Agni himself, has made plain. But Indra knows where Agni  is and has guided the sacrificers so that they may recover him (vs. 8). Ultimately,  nothing can keep Agni from the sacrificers, as the presence of Agni as the sun in  heaven shows (vss. 9–10), and he will honor the command of the gods to help the  sacrificer (vs. 12).  
Geldner also summarizes a narrative later connected to this hymn, mentioned  in Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa XIII 3.12, Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa III 94, Br̥haddevatā V 12–23 and given also by Sāyaṇa. According to the version of the Br̥haddevatā, King  Tryaruṇa was riding in a chariot driven by his purohita Vr̥śa Jāna. A brahmin boy  was killed by the chariot, and the king blamed the purohita. Vr̥śa brought the boy  back to life, but then stormed away in anger because of the king’s accusation. When  the purohita departed, however, so did the fury of the king’s sacrificial fire and with  it the ability of the fire to cook the oblations. Therefore the king went to Vr̥śa and  persuaded him to return as his purohita and to restore the fire’s fury. When he came  back, Vr̥śa found that a Piśācī woman in the king’s house had taken the fury of the  king’s fire. But by reciting V.2.9 Vr̥śa caused the fury to return and to burn the Piśācī woman. As Geldner rightly concludes, this story draws on elements of the hymn,  but the hymn is surely not based on it.
