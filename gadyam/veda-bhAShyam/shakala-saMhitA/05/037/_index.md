Indra  
Atri Bhauma  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Two verses devoted to the activities of the dawn sacrifice open the hymn; the last  two verses (4–5) describe the successes of the king whose sacrifice Indra attends,  with the king’s actions assimilated to Indra’s great deeds (Vala and Vr̥tra, both 4cd).  The middle verse (3) is a sort of riddle and serves, therefore, as a mild omphalos: the  bride in question may be Speech, as the beloved of Indra (as some have suggested),  or perhaps Dawn. The husband may be Indra, or the Sun. (We favor the Dawn/Sun  interpretation, which is in keeping with the dawn-ritual context.)  
There are two pieces of onomastic verbal play that look outside the hymn  proper. In verse 3c the phrase “his chariot will seek fame” (śravasyād ráthaḥ) recalls  the name of the patron Śruta-ratha, whose praise ended the previous hymn (V.36.6).  And the phrase “with the radiance of the sun” (bhānúnā ...sū́ryasya) in the first  pāda of the hymn (1a), describing Agni, is actually the solution to the story of  Svar-bhānu (“[Having] the Sun’s Radiance”) told in V.40.5–9. It is especially appro  
priate to find this answer given at the beginning of this hymn here, as it is the first in  a series of hymns attributed to Atri, among which is V.40.
