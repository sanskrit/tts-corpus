11 verses: triṣṭubh  
A lovely hymn, both narrating the opening of the Vala cave by the power of the  Aṅgirases’ poetic speech and welcoming the dawn of a new day and the sunrise on  that mythic model. The hymn begins (vss. 1–3) with a description of sunrise, with  no overt mention of the myth, though it clearly lurks in the background. The poet is  concerned to apply the mythic model to the current sacrificial situation. He initiates  the ritual in verse 4, and then in the two, paired, middle verses in the hymn (5–6),  an omphalos, he exhorts his priestly comrades to achieve the poetic vision (dhī́)  that has served others well in the past. The particular past he has in mind becomes  clear in the following two verses (7–8), which depict the opening of the Vala cave  and the Aṅgirases’ role in it. The next two verses first pray that the Sun will come up  (9) and then announce that he has arisen (10). The exhortations in verses 5–6 have  worked! In the last verse (11) the poet (addressing himself, as well as his priestly  colleagues) exults over this success: “the poetic vision that wins the sun,” the same  one that the Aṅgirases possessed, has now been acquired, and it will bring welfare  to the community. It is noteworthy that Indra, the usual hero of the Vala myth, is  not mentioned in connection with it (though he does make an appearance in vs. 4);  presumably the poet wishes to identify himself and his priestly comrades with the  chorus of Indra’s associates, the Aṅgirases, rather than with the god.  
A brief grammatical digression is necessary here in order to show the particular  artfulness of this hymn. As noted, the first three verses already describe, in some  detail, the dawn and the sunrise, and so it might be thought that the sunrise in  verse 10 is an anticlimax. But a remarkable fact about the first three verses is that  the description of the sunrise there is couched almost entirely in the verb form  known as the injunctive, which has no overt marker of tense. Although its default  interpretation is past tense, it can be used also to depict “timeless” events. (Since  English lacks such a verbal category, we have used the present tense here.) The sun rise in verses 1–3 is both the mythic model of the Vala-Aṅgiras narrative and, more  important, the ideal sunrise to which the poet aspires. In contrast to the insistent injunctives in these verses, when today’s sunrise, the successful result of the sacri ficers’ and poet’s efforts, is depicted in verse 10, all four verb forms have the overt  marker of past tense, the so-called augment, making it clear that the sunrise there  has indeed (just) occurred. Another example of R̥gvedic poets’ sensitivity to gram matical categories and their ingenious deployment of them.

All Gods On the structure of the hymn and the grammatical patterning that supports that structure, see published introduction. Note that this patterning imposes presential renderings of the injunctives in the first three vss.
