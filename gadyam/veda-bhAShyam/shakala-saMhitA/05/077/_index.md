Aśvins  
Atri Bhauma  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Like the preceding one, this hymn is attributed to Atri, and shares with it the same  meter and same final verse. The hymn refers to the Aśvins in the third person in every  verse except the central one (3), when the poet turns to the Aśvins and addresses  them directly, describing to them the chariot that brings them to his sacrifice. The  description of the chariot compares or even identifies this chariot with the sacrifice,  since “golden-skinned, honey-colored, ghee-backed, and carrying nourishments”  can easily describe the sacrificial fire.  
The time of the Aśvins’ arrival is the particular concern of the poet. They  are the gods prātaryā́vaṇā “who journey in the early morning,” and the poet  insists that his hymn and offerings are given at the right time. They are not  given too early when it is still dark, for the evening is the wrong time to make  the offerings (vs. 2ab)—although whether it is the wrong time in general or the  wrong time for the Aśvins in particular is unsure. Likewise, unlike others he  does not make his offerings too late, after dawn has already broken (2cd). The  “ungenerous vulture” in 1cd is probably a sacrificer who gave too few offerings  too late.
