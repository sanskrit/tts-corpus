Agni  
Iṣa Ātreya  
10 verses: anuṣtubh, except paṅkti 10  
At the beginning (vss. 1–3) the poet repeats the word sám “together” alone or in  compounds. The first pāda draws particular attention to the word with its repetition  

of sa(m): sákhāyaḥ sáṃ vaḥ samyáñcam. In the middle verses (4, 5, 7, 8) sám is  echoed by the particle smā/sma “again,” or more exactly “as always.” The last verse  (10) is in a different meter, and, marked by its opening íti “with these words,” it  stands outside of the main body of the poem. The real concluding verse, therefore,  is verse 9, in which sám is echoed again, this time by śám “luck.” The one verse  in which neither sám nor one of its echo words occurs (6) is actually a dependent  clause that is completed by verses 7–8. The sound repetitions thematically link the  union (sám) of both the priests and the offerings, the return of Agni (sma/smā), and  finally the good luck (śám) that the sacrifice will bring to Agni and the benefit that  Agni will bring to both gods and humans.  
As mentioned above, the poet extends a statement across three verses (6–8).  This highly unusual construction marks the climax of the hymn, which describes  the moment when Agni “streams forth.” Indeed, the extended statement even  iconically suggests the extension of the sacrificial fire as it creeps throughout  the wood. However, this strategy creates challenging syntax: verse 6 is a relative  clause describing Agni, verse 7 a causal clause that explains how it is that Agni is  a homeland for Āyu and his descendants, and verse 8 concludes with the appear  
ance of Agni.  
Finally, one philological explanation:  in verse 7 we read ákṣitam rather than  ā́kṣitam with the Padapāṭha.
