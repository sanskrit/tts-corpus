Maruts  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
17 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 6, 16–17  
As befits the first hymn in this Marut cycle, the poet Śyāvāśva addresses himself  with an exhortation to praise the Maruts in the first pāda of the first verse. He then  

describes them in a general fashion and asserts their right to the sacrifice, in a short  ring-compositional introduction (vss. 1–5). (For the responsions of verses 1 and 5  as an example of “poetic repair,” see Jamison 2006.)  
The next section of the hymn (vss. 6–13) depicts the Maruts as the gods of the  thunderstorm in a series of vivid images and also fancifully assigns individual  names to them (vss. 10–11)—the Maruts are otherwise undifferentiated—ending  with another exhortation to the poet to praise them (vs. 13cd). In the last few verses  (14–17) ritual honor is given to the Maruts, and they respond with gifts. The last  verse (17) resembles a dānastuti, but with the Maruts, rather than humans, as the  donors to the poet; they were already identified as “patrons” (sūrí) in the two pre  
ceding verses (15–16).  
The density of imagery throughout is remarkable; we will give just one example,  from verse 9. There the Maruts are said to “clothe themselves in wool in the Paruṣṇī River.” The “wool” must stand for foam, off-white and fluffy like newly shorn wool.  But the river foam is yet another metaphorical substitute for something else, namely  clouds, which the Maruts as storm gods would be clothed in—all of this conveyed  in an economical half-verse.

Maruts The pattern of the mention of the Maruts’ name in this hymn is worth noting: it might be called a “versified paradigm” (à la I.1) with a hole in it. The various oblique forms of the plural stem marút- are densely clustered at the beginning of the hymn: instr. marúdbhiḥ (1b), gen. marútām (3c), loc. marútsu (4a), dat. marúdbhyaḥ (5d), and acc. marútaḥ (6d) -- each oblique case represented (if abl. is lumped with dat.), each once only. In addition there are three forms of the vṛddhied mā́rutam in the neut. acc. sg. later in the hymn (8a, 13c, 14a). However, though these gods are frequently referred to in the nom. pl. in the hymn, beginning with yé in 1c, and once in the voc. (dhṛṣṇavaḥ 14c), there are no forms of the nom. marútaḥ or the voc. márutaḥ / marutaḥ, although these are the most common forms of this stem in the RV. After the paradigm has been established in the early part of the hymn (1-6), there are no further occurrences of the simple stem in the 11 remaining vss. (7-17), only the three vṛddhi forms. I don’t know what, if anything, to make of this, but it does not seem by chance.

On the responsions and ring-compositional structure of vss. 1-5, see the published

introduction. and my “Poetic ‘Repair’ in the Rig Veda” (2006: 133-36), as well as The Rigveda between Two Worlds (2007: 112-13). The responsions and the versified paradigm are most likely related; as I argue in “Poetic ‘Repair’” the instr. in the phrase árcā marúdbhiḥ … in vs. 1 is somewhat anomalous, but it is “repaired” by the substitution of the expected dat. in 5d … arcā marúdbhyaḥ. To summarize those discussions briefly, in a hymn devoted to the Maruts, beginning with the selfexhortation of the poet “chant forth,” we might expect the Maruts to be the recipients (dat.) of the chant, not, as it seems, fellow-chanters (instr.) with the human poet. But putting them in the instr. emphasizes an important part of their profile, that they are also known to chant, a feature that is alluded to by the hemistich-final adj. ṛ́kvabhiḥ ‘possessing the chant’. Thus the beginning of the hymn seems concerned with the Maruts’ contrastive and mediating functional roles as expressed by the oblique cases of the paradigm.
