Dawn  
Satyaśravas Ātreya  
10 verses: paṅkti  
A hymn with a remarkably unwavering focus on material gain. Since the priestly gifts  (dakṣiṇā) are distributed at the dawn ritual, the goddess Dawn is often associated  

with wealth and giving, but here very little attention is given to any other aspect of  the goddess. The tone is set by the increasingly monotonous refrain: “o well-born  lady, liberal with horses.” Several patrons are named in the first verses (1–3), and the  poet hopes that patrons in general will be the recipients of Dawn’s bounty, in order  for them to redistribute it to the poets (4–8).  
The usual attention to Dawn’s beauty, her first appearance, her journey, her  cows, and so forth is entirely missing in this hymn, which does, however, con tain one striking image, in verse 9. Why a laggard Dawn would be compared  to a thief isn’t entirely clear, but it is quite possibly because thieves worked  at night.

Dawn The meter of this hymn is Paṅkti, with five 8-syllable pādas. The fifth in all vss. is the refrain, a voc. phrase sújāte aśvasūnṛte “o well-born lady, liberal with horses,” which is essentially detachable. So the hymn comes across as standard Anuṣṭubh, with an appended and superfluous refrain. As indicated in the published translation, the contents are for the most part uninspired, contrary to most Dawn hymns, though closer inspection reveals more intricate patterns than a superficial reading turned up.
