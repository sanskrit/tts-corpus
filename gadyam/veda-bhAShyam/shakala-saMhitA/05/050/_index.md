Svastyātreya Ātreya  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5  
This little hymn is surprisingly beset by difficulties, especially of syntax, reference,  and meter. A particularly intricate set of syntactic constructions modulates from  the singular “everyman” of verse 1, through an indefinite plural 3rd person, also  representing men in general (“they” 2ab), to an identification of those indefinite  men with “us” (2cd)—all of whom desire wealth and the companionship of the  god “Leader,” identified by the later tradition with Savitar (whom we met in V.49),  though this identification is not necessary.  
The scene shifts to the sacrifice in the next two verses (3–4), and the “we” of verse  2 becomes the “you” in verse 3, exhorted to do honor to the gods and their wives  as guests at the sacrifice. The identities remain off-balance, however: the verb used  for “honor” is one whose subject is usually a god and whose object a mortal, so  role reversal is implied. And the gods are not identified as “gods,” but rather called  “men”—using the word nŕ̥, which refers to especially elite, noble, or worthy men, and  is often elsewhere applied to gods. Verse 4 depicts the mythic model of the soma sacri fice, with Indra invigorated by soma to be a winner. This leads us back to god Leader  and prayers for wealth and well-being in response to our ritual offerings (vs. 5).

All Gods As often, the poet embellishes a fairly simple message by playing with personal reference, cycling through all three persons in very short compass. See the disc. in the published introduction. as well as more details in the comm. on individual vss. below.
