Aśvins  
Paura Ātreya  
10 verses: anuṣṭubh  
The hymn opens with the poet wondering where the Aśvins can be (vs. 1). Are they  with another people (vs. 2)? Or to whom are they traveling (vs. 3)? The poet wishes  them to come to Atri—as in the last hymn, the poet himself (vs. 1)—and to seek  out his poetic formulations (vs. 3), not those of others. Several verses later, the poet  returns once more to beg the Aśvins’ attention (vs. 6), to ask again whose inspired  poetry and sacrifices have attracted the Aśvins (vs. 7), and to urge them to come  to him (vss. 8–10). The last verse of the hymn echoes the first: verse 1 asks where the Aśvins are (kū́ ṣṭhaḥ) and whether they will hear the poet (śravathaḥ); verse 10  addresses them wherever they are (kárhi cid) and anticipates that they will hear  him (śuśrūyā́tam). Also, in the first verse the poet addresses the Aśvins as manāvasū “whose goods are zeal”—that is, as those who bring vigor and passion to sacrifi cers—and vr̥ṣaṇvasū “whose goods are bull-like,” but in the last he speaks not of  goods that the Aśvins bring but rather of the “good benefits” (vásvīḥ ... bhújaḥ) the  Aśvins will receive, thus reversing the beneficiaries of the goods.  
How the internal verses set within this frame are connected to the rest of the  hymn is not clear. They tell how the Aśvins rescued Paura from real or metaphorical  waters (vs. 4) and Cyavāna from old age and impotence (vs. 5). The story of Paura,  whom the Anukramaṇī identifies as the poet of the hymn, is told elliptically. There  is a cryptic etymological play on Paura’s name in 4ab that suggests that Paura had  lost the prosperity that was his by right, or at least by name, but that he was restored  to “muchness” by the Aśvins. Unfortunately, the meaning of paurá is not secure  and therefore neither is this interpretation. This word play on paurá is set within  a causal hí-clause, which normally would be dependent but here apparently is not,  and it is then followed by an incomplete dependent clause, which lacks both subject  and verb. The abstract dative gr̥bhītátātaye “for captivity” suggests supplying a verb  derived from √gr̥bh “capture”—“they capture him” or the like—but this interpreta tion is not at all secure. Is the fragmented syntax an icon of the desperate situation  that the Aśvins were able to redress?
