॥ श्रीगणेशाय नमः ।।

यस्य निःश्वसितं वेदा यो वेदेभ्योऽखिलं जगत् ।।

निर्ममे तमहं वन्दे विद्यातीर्थमहेश्वरम् ॥

अथ तृतीयोऽध्याय आरभ्यते । तत्र ‘ प्रयुञ्जती ' इति सप्तर्चं तृतीयं सूक्तं प्रतिरथस्यार्षं त्रैष्टुभम् । पूर्वत्र  वैश्वदेवं वै तत् ' इत्युक्तत्वादिदमपि वैश्वदेवम् ।  ‘ प्रयुञ्जती सप्त प्रतिरथः ' इत्यनुक्रमणिका । विनियोगो लैङ्गिकः ॥

Pratiratha Ātreya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
Each verse in this short hymn presents a riddle: a description of a god or divine force  whose name is withheld till late in the verse (1, 2) or suppressed entirely (3–6). This is  not an uncommon tactic in All God hymns—a particularly deft example is VIII.29.  This hymn presents several twists on this device. First, the characterizations seem regu  
larly intended to mislead. For example, verse 1 has a feminine subject, and given the  actions ascribed to her, the audience would expect the subject to be Dawn. But instead  it is (Poetic) Inspiration (manīṣā́), here identified as the mother of Dawn (presumably  because early-morning ritual poetry awakens Dawn and impels her to appear). Again,  the attributes of the subject in verse 2 suggest Agni’s flames, but the actual referent,  the last word of the verse, is “Paths.” Second, the riddles get harder as the hymn pro  
gresses. As was already noted, in verses 1 and 2 the solution is given, but thereafter it is  not. In verse 3 the solution is fairly obvious by the end of the verse, but in verse 4 it is  less so. Verse 5 announces itself as an enigma, and it seems to have double application  to both the Sun and Agni. There is no agreed upon solution for verse 6.  
Although this observation is unconnected to the riddle structure just discussed,  each verse (but 5) has a form of div/dyu “heaven” (mostly diváḥ) (vs. 5 has d(u)vé “two,” which is phonologically close). The final pāda of the hymn is an “homage to  Heaven.” Although this homage was not prepared thematically in the hymn, it was  prepared verbally, by the repetition of the stem in various syntactic and semantic  contexts.
