All Gods  
Pratikṣatra Ātreya  
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 2, 8  
Renou pronounces this hymn “banal,” and certainly the long enumeration of divin ities, listed with little or no characterization or action, does not engage the audience  in the same way that the intricacies of the previous All God hymns in this maṇḍala  do. However, there are two features of note in the hymn, and these features have, in  our view, a covert connection. The hymn ends with two verses praising the Wives  of the Gods in general and particular gods’ wives by title: Indrāṇī, Agnāyī (wife of  Agni), Aśvinī, Varuṇānī (vs. 8); the Wives (of the Gods) are also mentioned in verse  2, and other goddesses are also featured in the hymn: Sarasvatī (vs. 2), Aditi (vss. 3,  6), the Waters (vs. 3), the Rivers (vs. 6). The second feature is that the first verse is  very different from the rest—the invocation of divinities only begins in verse 2. In  verse 1 the 1st-person poet-sacrificer describes himself as hitched to a chariot-pole  and, despite the effort involved, does not wish to be released from this yoking.  
Now it is certainly possible that the yoking image only refers to the poet-sacrificer’s  usual tasks at the sacrifice. However, in conjunction with the emphasis on the gods’  wives (pátnīḥ) later in the hymn, we suggest that what this hymn is ever so delicately  concerning itself with is an important and controversial innovation: the introduc  
tion of the Sacrificer’s Wife (pátnī) as a necessary participant in the ritual. As has  been argued elsewhere (Jamison 2011, forthcoming a and b), though the Sacrificer’s  Wife is a fixture already in early middle Vedic ritual (see Jamison 1996a), there is  no evidence for her participation in early R̥gvedic ritual. The introduction of the  Sacrificer’s Wife in the middle to late R̥gveda (presumably beginning with only one  or a few priestly circles) seems to have been, understandably, controversial, and  though it is not referred to directly in the text, there are covert arguments, pro  and con, in a number of hymns. One of the important images of the new ritual  pairing of Sacrificer and Wife is that of a pair of draft-animals jointly yoked to a  chariot-pole (e.g., VIII.33.18, X.102.10), pulling the sacrifice together, though with  the husband maintaining a slight edge in strength and effort. It seems quite possible  that this image is found in verse 1: the male yoked to the pole, pulling a feminine referent (the chariot-pole, which is grammatically feminine, but also secondarily the  wife), and with no desire to return to the old state of affairs. The last word in this  verse, neṣati “he will lead,” reminds of the priestly title, Neṣṭar “Leader,” the priest  whose duty it is to lead the Sacrificer’s Wife around the sacrificial ground in later  śrauta ritual; he is already marginally represented in the R̥gveda as a leader of the  Wives of the Gods (see especially I.15.3).  
If this scenario is correct—that verse 1 represents an argument in favor of the  new model of sacrifice including the Sacrificer’s Wife—then the lists of gods that  follow might be a form of insurance. Every possible divinity is called upon to wit ness and give tacit approval to the innovation. And the Wives of the Gods, who  provide the divine model for the Sacrificer’s Wife, are called on especially insistently  to come to the sacrifice and provide their help and support.

All Gods On my hypothesis concerning the reason for this hymn, viz., support for the ritual innovation of the Patnī, see published introduction. Save for the final two vss. devoted to the wives of the gods, there seems no rationale for the deities included or excluded from the enumerative vss. or for the repetition of some and not others.
