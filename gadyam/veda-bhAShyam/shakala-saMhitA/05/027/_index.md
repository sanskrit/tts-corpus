Agni  
Kings Tryaruṇa Traivr̥ṣṇa, Trasadasyu Paurukutsya, and Aśvamedha Bhārata, or  Atri Bhauma  
6 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, anuṣṭubh 4–6, arranged in trcas ̥  
This hymn consists of two tr̥cas, so it is in its proper place according to its length.  Nonetheless, Oldenberg (Noten and 1897) regards it as an addition to the original  collection.  
The hymn is a dānastuti addressed to allied patrons or kings. The Anukramaṇī names three patrons, but, as Oldenberg (1897) and Geldner suggest, Tryaruṇa  might be a descendant of Trasadasyu and bear his name as an epithet (vs. 3). If so,  then the hymn addresses two men, Tryaruṇa (vss. 1–3 in triṣṭubh) and Aśvamedha  (vss. 4–6 in anuṣṭubh). In verse 4 Tryaruṇa commands Aśvamedha to reward the  poet, but it remains unclear just how the two are related.  
The translation and interpretation of the hymn become difficult especially at  verse 3, which is open to a number of different constructions. We understand 3ab  to mean that the sacrificer desires Agni’s favor for the poet’s hymn. Why he should  desire this favor navamám “for the ninth time” is not stated, but there is a parallel in  VIII.24.23, which calls on the poet to praise daśamám “a tenth time.” In both verses  the numbers may simply indicate “many times.” Here in this hymn, however, it is  likely that navamám, especially because it follows náviṣṭhāya “for the newest,” either  means “anew” rather than “ninth” or puns on the two meanings. The “harnessed  chariot,” with which Tryaruṇa welcomes the poet’s song in 3cd, may be a gift to the  poet, or it may be the sacrifice itself, which elsewhere is represented as a chariot.  
Verse 4 begins the second tr̥ca, a transition that is marked also by a change in  meter. But in contrast to the clear segmentation of the hymn shown by the tr̥ca form  and the meter, the syntax binds verse 4 with verse 3, since the opening relative clause  is coordinate with the relative clause in 3cd. This may reproduce the relationship  between Tryaruṇa and Aśvamedha, who are two individuals but who are in some  manner bound to one another.
