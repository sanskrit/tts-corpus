Agni  
Sutambhara Ātreya  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn repeatedly asserts that the poet is speaking the truth (r̥tá), and therefore,  since Agni himself speaks the truth (vs. 3) and attends to the truth (vs. 2), he should  attend to the poet and grant his wishes. In verse 5 the poet contrasts himself and  his truth-speaking with those who were apparently once his allies, whose words  and whose attacks against him are now twisted and false. The questions in 4bcd  are ironic, for in fact Agni offers no protection to a lying cheat. Pāda 4a might also  be taken ironically or not: the bonds (bándhana) could be the bonds of friendship  with Agni—in its other two R̥gvedic attestations the word means “connection” in  a neutral or positive sense—or they could be the fetters that the poet clearly hopes  are the cheat’s reward.
