Agni  
Vasuśruta Ātreya  
12 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn opens with identifications of Agni with the Ādityas—Varuṇa and  Mitra in verse 1 and Aryaman and Mitra in verse 2. The reason for these identi fications is not immediately clear, and indeed in various ways the poet also mar shals the presence of other gods: Indra in verse 1, the Maruts, Viṣṇu, and Rudra  in verse 3, and all the gods again in verse 1. After invoking the presence of the  gods, the poet then describes the installation of the sacrificial fire (vss. 4–5). In  verses 6–7 he asks that the presence of the sacrificial fire also mark the presence  of Agni’s help against those who are offending against his people and himself.  He mentions evil speech (vs. 7) and curses brought against its speaker (vss. 7,  12)  and also against thieves and cheats (vs. 11)  threatening him. He therefore  asks the god for rescue (vs. 9). This concern explains the prominence of the  Ādityas at the beginning of the hymn, since they are the gods who oversee social  relations among humans and therefore can protect against people who seek to  harm others.
