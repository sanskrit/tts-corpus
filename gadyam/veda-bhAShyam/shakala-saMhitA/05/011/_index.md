Agni  
Sutambhara Ātreya  
6 verses: jagatī  
As in the previous hymn, there is an energetic pointing to Agni, who is insistently  named at the beginning of each pāda in verse 4 and addressed in the 2nd person at  the beginning of 5abc and 6a, d. There is also an emphasis on Agni’s expanse: his  radiance (vs. 1) and his smoke (vs. 3) touch heaven; he is a visible beacon (vss. 2,  3); he is present in every household (vs. 4); he is filled with vast power (śávas, vs.  5); and he even extends backward in time all the way to the first man, Vivasvant  (vs. 3). The description of Agni as shining for the Bharatas (vs. 1) may explain why  there is this emphasis on his expanse. The Agni of this hymn may be the tribal  fire of the Bharatas, and therefore the poet wishes to emphasize Agni’s presence  among all the people of the Bharatas and the extent of the Bharatas’ territory  or power.
