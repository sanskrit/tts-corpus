Indra  
Gātu Ātreya  
12 verses: triṣṭubh  
In contrast to the bricolage of the previous hymn, this hymn concentrates on a  single myth, the Vr̥tra battle, occupying verses 1–8 and providing one of the most  sustained accounts of this story outside of I.32. But this poet avoids using the stan dard formulae associated with that narrative, instead ringing changes on the nor mal phraseology (especially the áhann áhim formula: “you/he smashed the serpent,”  which does not appear as such in this hymn). Considerable attention is paid to  Indra’s opponent, but interestingly the word vr̥trá is never used. Instead he is identi fied several times as Dānava (descendant of Dānu, who is called Vr̥tra’s mother in  I.32.9, or a member of the demonic Dānu tribe) and once called śúṣṇa, usually the  name of a different foe of Indra (see, e.g., nearby V.29.9), but here probably used in  its etymological sense, “hisser.” But mostly he is nameless, a state emphasized by the  emphatic, repeated, verse-initial forms of t(i)yá- cid “that very one” (vss. 3, 4, 5, 6,  8), a sort of empty and open-ended deictic that attracts a series of shifting descrip tors of horror. The emphasis on darkness (vss. 4, 5, 6), fog (vs. 4), and emptiness (vs.  7) also suggests an indistinct enemy that lacks proper definition.  
After this depiction of Indra’s great victory over the multifarious monster, it  comes as no surprise that in the next verses (9–11) Indra’s power is universally  acknowledged by cosmic forces and mortals alike. Verse 9 opens with the ques tion “who can obstruct him?”—using the verb varāte, belonging to the same root  and having the same semantics as the suppressed name Vr̥tra “obstruction.” The  question thus carries with it an implied conditional—“who can obstruct him if  Obstruction itself cannot?”—with the implicit answer obviously “no one.” The last  verse turns, as often, to the benefits Indra can bestow on the poet, ending with a perhaps teasing rhetorical question, paraphrasable as: “Do (other) poets complain  about your gifts?”
