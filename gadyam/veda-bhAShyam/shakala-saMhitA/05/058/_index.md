58 (412)  
Maruts  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Another pleasing Marut hymn with the typical mixture of storm imagery (see esp.  vss. 6–7) and portrayal of a wild but beneficial Männerbund. In this latter capacity,  the Maruts are seen as the source of various earthly counterparts (vs. 4). Another  common theme, the lack of distinction among the various members of the band, is  also mentioned (vs. 5). As in V.56.3 a sexual relationship between the Maruts and  the Earth is depicted (vs. 7), though without the shock value of the earlier passage.

Maruts As Oldenberg (Proleg. 204-5) points out these two hymns are parallel and share a final vs. He attributes their position at the beginning of the four 8-vs. Marut hymns to this twinning. Otherwise V.58, in Triṣṭubh, should follow V.59, in Jagatī.</details>
