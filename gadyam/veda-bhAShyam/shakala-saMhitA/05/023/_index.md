Agni  
Dyumna Viśvacarṣaṇi Ātreya  
4 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 4  
This hymn invokes the fire that grants wealth, especially a wealth of cattle (vs. 2),  which brings with it dominance over surrounding lands. At the same time the ability  of Agni to grant wealth and power also depends on the sacrificers who bring the  ritual grass (3a), who establish Agni as their Hotar (3c), and whose words confer  power on him (1d). The references to the tribes who pursue Agni (vs. 3) and to  Agni himself as the one “who belongs to all lands” (vs. 4) suggest that the fire of  this hymn either was or was at least compared to the common fire that united the  various Ārya peoples.
