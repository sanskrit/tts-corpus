Agni  
The Vasūyava Ātreyas  
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
Like the preceding hymn, this hymn comprises three tr̥cas. It draws on repeated  pādas, especially although not exclusively in the final pādas of verses: 1c = VI.16.2c  and VIII.102.16c; 2c = VII.16.4b; 4c = V.20.3a, VIII.60.1b, and X.21.1b; 5c = I.12.4c  and VIII.44.14c; 7c = V.22.2b; and 9c = I.39.5d. Geldner provides a complete list of  the repetitions. As such, it is reminiscent of the assemblages that constitute the kin  
dling verses in several priestly families (see V.28 below). The first two tr̥cas (vss. 1–3,  4–6) are a direct address to Agni to assume his role as the one who conveys obla tions to the gods and perfects the ritual. In the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the poet turns to  his fellow priests, telling them to install the fire, prepare the seat for the gods, and  perform the rites in order, and then in the final verse, with the fire now blazing and  the priests performing their roles, he invites various gods, perhaps representing the  All Gods, to take their seats.
