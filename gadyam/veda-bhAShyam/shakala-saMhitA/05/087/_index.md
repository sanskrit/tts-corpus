Maruts  
Evayāmarut Ātreya  
9 verses: atijagatī  
This final hymn of Maṇḍala V is clearly an addition to the original collection, and  it is composed in an unusual lyric meter found only in this hymn and a few scat tered verses in the rest of the saṃhitā, consisting of five pādas arranged in two  half-verses: 12 12 / 12 8 8. (It is convenient here to place the final two pādas on  a separate verse line.) The end of the first hemistich of each verse is marked by  the unusual formation evayā́marut, which serves as an internal refrain, syntacti cally unconnected to the rest of the verse. This word is aberrantly formed, and  our translation reflects what we consider its intent, rather than a literal value. (The  Anukramaṇī names Evayāmarut as the poet of this hymn, but the name is obvi ously secondarily derived from the refrain. We would not be surprised if Śyāvāśva  was responsible for this playful Marut hymn.) Indeed, the syntax is lax in a number  of verses, which appear to be constructed of metrical phrases with internal syntac tic unity but loosely strung together.  
In terms of content the most striking feature is the close association between the  god Viṣṇu and the Maruts. The Maruts are mentioned with Viṣṇu in other places  in the R̥gveda, but not in such a sustained fashion as here. The thematic connection  between them is not entirely clear, but Viṣṇu’s famous three strides from earth to  heaven, via the midspace, do remind us of the ever-journeying Maruts, who gener  
ally inhabit the midspace but are found also both in heaven and on earth.

Maruts Renou nicely characterizes this hymn (in his comm. on vs. 5) “l'hymne est fait de débris empruntés au cycle ancien des M.” Certainly there is a sense that the vss. are constructed of loosely connected phrases, which may well be connected with the unusual meter.

As disc. in the published introduction, the final word of the 2nd pāda of each vs., evayā́marut, appears to be an exclamatory internal refrain without syntactic connection to the rest of the vs. Geldner by contrast takes it in each case as forming a nominal sentence with unexpressed Viṣṇu (usually, but see below): “(Viṣṇu is der) mit dem die Marut gern kommen.” But though Viṣṇu is surprisingly prominent in this hymn, I don’t think he outranks the Maruts, and the formation of evayā́marut is too peculiar to be folded into a conventional (if invisible) nominal clause. Though sg., I think it must refer to the Maruts, who, after all, appear in the collective sg. in the rest of the vs. (pādas cde) as a troop (śárdha-). For the phrase on which this is built, see V.41.16 evayā́marutaḥ.
