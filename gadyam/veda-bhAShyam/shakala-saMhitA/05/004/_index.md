Agni  
Vasuśruta Ātreya  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
In this hymn the poet sets forth what we—the poet and the other sacrificers—will  do and receive within the frame of what Agni, typically addressed in the 2nd  person, will accomplish. The poet draws attention to “we” and “you” by front ing the personal pronouns and using their non-enclitic forms. He announces this  strategy in the first verse, which begins with tvā́m “you,” and then the following  verses largely describe Agni as the sacrificial fire, who conveys the oblations to  the gods (vs. 2) and the gods to the oblations (vs. 4). Verses 5 and especially 6, the  omphalos verse, mark a thematic movement from the sacrificial fire that serves  the gods to the fire that mortals serve and that serves mortals. In verse 7 the first  word of each pāda and in verse 8 the first word of each hemistich is “we” or “us.”  Enclitic and non-enclitic forms of the 1st-person plural pronoun also occur in  verses 9 and 10, and in verse 10 the poet personalizes the verse even more deeply  by using 1st-person singular verbs:  jóhavīmi “I repeatedly invoke” and aśyām  
“may I attain.” The last verse abandons the 1st person altogether, instead refer ring to the recipient of Agni’s favor as “he,” and with tvám “you” in the first  pāda, it returns to the initial focus on Agni.
