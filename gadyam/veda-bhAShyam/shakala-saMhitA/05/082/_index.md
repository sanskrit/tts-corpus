Savitar  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
9 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1, arranged in trcas ̥  
Structuring this hymn is an insistent pun on the name of Savitar (“the Impeller”)  derived from the root sū “impel”: there are eight separate verbal and nominal forms  of this root in the hymn. Savitar is also identified as the Apportioner (Bhaga), who  often elsewhere appears as a separate divinity though regularly associated with  Savitar, and what he is urged to impel is, for the most part, a good portion for us.

Savitar As noted in the published introduction. as well as just above ad V.81, this hymn contains numerous verbal and nominal forms of the root √sū ‘impel’, whose agent noun ‘Impeller’ Savitar is grammatically. Every vs. in the hymn contains a form of the name savitár-, but play on the root doesn’t start till vs. 3. There are eight such forms, with a concentration on the impv. in the middle: pres. subj. suvā́ti (3b), aor. injunc.

sāvīḥ (4b), pres. impv. suva (4c, 5b, 5c), them. loc. savé (6b), them. acc. (satyá)savam (7c), with a return to the original pres. subj. suvā́ti (9c). Starting with vs. 3, only vs. 8 lacks such a form -- but s u vā(dhīr) with distracted suvā fits phonologically, though not etymologically. We might also note that the first two vss., which lack the punning root forms, do contain forms that might be considered phonological precursors: 1c sarva(-dhā́tamam), 2a sváyaśastaram, 2c svarāj i yam.

With so much concentration on form in this hymn, we should not be surprised that the content is not particularly stimulating.
