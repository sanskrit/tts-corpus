Indra  
Atri Bhauma  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Geldner, the most authoritative twentieth-century translator of the R̥gveda, pro nounced this hymn empty of content (“inhaltslos”). This judgment does not seem  entirely fair, but the hymn is characterized by a certain lack of syntactic coherence,  as well as an overabundance of elaborate vocatives addressed to Indra. It is not  clear who the second god is in verse 3, though he is possibly Varuṇa; otherwise the  hymn only makes reference to Indra.  
The hymn is in some ways a twin to the following one, sharing vocabulary  and thematics, but the second hymn provides only limited help in interpreting  this one.

Indra For the general contents, see disc. in published introduction. Witzel Gotō interpr. it as plea to Indra for rain -- a purpose that I find very hard to discern and that results in farfetched interpr. of details.
