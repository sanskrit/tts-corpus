Agni  
Sutambhara Ātreya  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
As in his previous two hymns Sutambhara emphasizes the power of the praise song  to awaken Agni. Here he fronts the name of Agni (vss. 1, 4–6) or a pronoun referring  to Agni (vss. 2, 3) in every verse. Verses 2–3 are not so much exceptions as a variation  of the structure of the other verses. These two verses form a single statement that  withholds the name “Agni” until it is fronted in their last pāda, 3c. Then verse 4 and  the following verses pick up “Agni” and continue with it as the first word in the verse.
