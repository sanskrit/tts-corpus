Mitra and Varuṇa  
Rātahavya Ātreya  
6 verses: anuṣṭubh  
This hymn shows similarities to the preceding hymn, attributed to the same poet.  Note especially the first line, whose beginning, ā́ cikitāna sukrátū “Here are the two  of strong resolve, o perceptive mortal,” uses similar lexical elements as 65.1a yáś cikéta sá sukrátuḥ “He who is perceptive has strong resolve.” In V.65 the poet singles  out Mitra, especially in the last three verses of the hymn. Here the poet addresses  Varuṇa alone in the first verse and Mitra alone in the last. This strategy has the  effect of defining a beginning and ending to the hymn, but there are also thematic  reasons for this distribution of divine names as well. Verse 1 mentions the “truth”  (r̥tá), which is particularly associated with Varuṇa, who presides over the truth, and  in verse 6 the poet hopes that his people will take their places (yátemahi) under the  gods’ protection. The root √yat “arrange,” here in the middle voice in the sense of  “take one’s place,” is characteristically associated with Mitra’s task of “arranging”  peoples according to the alliances among them, as was noted in the introduction  to V.65.  
Renou characterizes this hymn as a eulogy of poetic power and an r̥tá, and he  is right that these are central concerns of the poet. The power of the hymn is indi rectly suggested in verses 1–2. In verse 1 the hymn is “set in place” (dadhītá) in the  ritual, and this act finds a social and cosmological echo in the next verse, where the  rule of Mitra and Varuṇa “is set in place” (dhāyi) in the way that the sun is set in  place. That is to say, in terms of the verse sequence of the poem, the hymn appears  in the ritual and then the rule of the gods appears. In verses 3–4 there is an extended  description of the poet’s work that implicitly compares it to a raid. As they often  are in the R̥gveda, the “chariots” sought by the poet (vs. 4) may be hymns or even  sacrifices that journey to the gods. In verse 5 the gods perceive the hymn of the poet,  brought to them by the “beacon of the peoples.” While interpreters have variously identified this beacon, we believe that it is most likely Agni (cf. V.11.2), who trans ports hymns and offerings to the gods.  
One of the poet’s strategies that makes this hymn interesting but difficult to  interpret is his use of indeterminate ellipsis (cf. vss. 1, 2, 3) and obscure reference  (esp. vs. 5). Verses 5–6 are the most intriguing example, because they form the cli max of the hymn. In 5ab the poet dramatically declares that he will enunciate the  “lofty truth,” but as is often the case, this lofty truth that he expresses in 5cd is an  abstruse one. By the double reference of yā́mabhiḥ to a poet’s entreaties and to river  courses, the words of the poet are compared to flowing streams. These streams flow  over Heaven and Earth, which expand for the poet in response. In this reading of  the hemistich, the masculine dual jrayasānaú “who extend” would be completed  by dyā́vā or the like, “Heaven and Earth.” This is suggested by the vocative pr̥thivi  
in 5a, echoed by pr̥thú in c, for dyā́vā regularly appears alongside the nominative  pr̥thivī́, as in I.159.1, II.12.13, II.41.20, VI.11.1, VII.69.1, and VIII.72.9. But the  poet’s words carrying their entreaties also flow beyond to Mitra and Varuṇa, who  likewise become even greater through them. Verse 6 then is a phalaśruti, a “declara  
tion of benefit,” expressing the expectation of the poet and his people that they will  live safely under the rule of Mitra and Varuṇa.
