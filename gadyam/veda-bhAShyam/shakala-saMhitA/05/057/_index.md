पञ्चमेऽनुवाके षोडश सूक्तानि । तत्र  ‘ आ रुद्रासः' इत्यष्टर्चं प्रथमं सूक्तं श्यावाश्वस्यार्षं मारुतम् । सप्तम्यष्टम्यौ त्रिष्टुभौ शिष्टाः षट् जगत्यः ।  ‘ आरुद्रासोऽष्टौ द्वित्रिष्टुबन्तम् ' इत्यनुक्रमणिका । विनियोगो लैङ्गिकः ॥

Maruts  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7–8  
Like the immediately preceding hymn, this one introduces other personnel besides  the Maruts, though not ones tied specifically to the sacrifice. The hymn begins by  

addressing the Maruts by their father’s name, “o Rudras,” a vocative that returns  in verse 7. Their mother Pr̥śni also figures in the hymn, in verses 2 and 3. The first  verse also describes them as “accompanied by Indra” (índravantaḥ). It is notable  how rarely Indra is mentioned in hymns dedicated to the Maruts, even though  they are his sidekicks and supporters from an Indraic point of view. In the whole  Marut cycle in Maṇḍala V this is the only appearance of Indra, and it is tellingly  phrased: Indra is himself treated as a sidekick, demoted into a possessive adjec  
tive: “possessing/accompanied by Indra.” It is ordinarily the Maruts who have this  grammatically subordinated role:  the adjective marútvant (“possessing/accompa nied by the Maruts”) is very common and regularly modifies Indra.  
In this hymn, then, the Maruts are defined first by their parentage and their  companion. The other elements that define them are their attributes, both physi cal and mental, lists of which are given in verses 2, 4, 5, and 6, constituting a  virtual iconography of the Maruts in verbal form. This listing modulates imper ceptibly into the beginning of verse 7, a list of goods possessed by the Maruts  that they have give to the singers, a subtle way of moving to the requests of the  final verses (7–8).  
The vivid description characteristic of Marut hymns is not absent here. See espe cially verses 2–3, with the Maruts as the storm.

Maruts As Oldenberg (Proleg. 204-5) points out these two hymns are parallel and share a final vs. He attributes their position at the beginning of the four 8-vs. Marut hymns to this twinning. Otherwise V.58, in Triṣṭubh, should follow V.59, in Jagatī.</details>
