Maruts  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
19 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 5 and satobr̥hatī 9  
With its nineteen verses, this hymn is out of place by the normal rules of arrange ment of the saṃhitā. It also falls into several sections on thematic grounds (vss. 1–4,  5–10, 11–16, 17–19). However, at least the first half (1–10) displays the cleverness  and sly humor of Śyāvāśva, who names himself directly in verse 5 and punningly  in verse 9, and perhaps represents a jeu d’esprit of the poet, appended to the more  solemn Marut hymns that precede it. Note that Śyāvāśva names himself only in the  first of those hymns (V.52.1) and in this last one.  
The Maruts are the clear subject of verses 1–4 and 11–16, and each of these sec tions is followed by a dānastuti, or verses culminating in a dānastuti: 10 and 17–19.  We therefore suggest that we are dealing here with two originally separate hymns,  1–10 and 11–19, and that the first at least bears clear marks of Śyāvāśva’s authorship.  
Since the second of these is less interesting than the first, we will discuss it first  here. The six verses (11–16) treating the Maruts are fairly conventional. Verse 17  serves as a transition to the dānastuti, addressed, oddly, to the goddess Night, who  is urged to carry the poet’s hymns to his patron, called Dārbhya here, and Rathavīti  in the following two verses. Both parts of the latter name are punned upon: ratha  
“chariot” in verse 17 (“like a charioteer”), -vīti “pursuit” in verse 18 in the verb form  (ápa) veti “go off track,” and he is praised for his generosity in general terms (19). The first hymn is a much less staid affair. The four opening verses to the Maruts  begin with questions about the Maruts and then in increasing detail about their horses and horse-tackle. And in verses 2c and 3b the Maruts are depicted as riding  horseback (one of the very few pieces of evidence for this activity in the R̥gveda); in  verse 2 the reference is unremarkable, but in verse 3 the men’s posture on the horse  reminds the poet of women spreading their thighs in sex (or possibly childbirth,  though this seems less likely). From this point on the hymn takes a sexually sug  
gestive turn. In verse 4 the Maruts are sent off with “lucky women,” and we move  abruptly into the second section of the hymn.  
That section ends with a real dānastuti verse (10) in praise of a patron named  Vaidadaśvi. We might expect the four preceding verses (5–9) to form part of the  dānastuti as well, and there are prominent dānastuti-like elements in them, but they  also subvert the dānastuti model or provide a counter model—not least because they  concern a woman and profess the unorthodox opinion that women can be superior  to men. Verse 5 introduces an unidentified woman who “gains” the sorts of things  poets usually receive in dānastutis, using the root for “gain” (san) that is standard in  such contexts. (The notion that a woman would be in such a position is so unusual  that most translators simply translate the word as if it means “give”—though a  woman who gives livestock is no more standard a figure than one who gains it.)  From the second half of the verse it is clear that she must be the favored consort  (perhaps even the “Favorite Wife” of later Vedic ritual) of Śyāvāśva’s patron. The  poet then seems to reflect (vss. 6–8) on the qualities of women in general, in contrast  to men, allowing that some women may actually be better than men, especially men  of bad character—and among those especially a stingy man (vss. 6, 8), who doesn’t  deserve to be called a man except in the technical matter of blood money (vs. 8). The  tone in these verses is colloquial and conversational. After this seeming digression,  with the subtle hint to his patron about the perils of stinginess, we return in verse 9  to a flesh-and-blood woman, who is working her wiles on the poet, who calls himself  “Dusky” (śyāva). The verse is an elaborate pun: on the one hand she is narrating the  course of a race, and the “two chestnuts” in the second half of the verse can be two  horses given to the poet, “straining forward” to win. But the tone is very intimate;  the “course” may be the progress of sexual intercourse between the girl and the poet,  and the second half of the verse, using the same verb (ví √yam “spread apart”) as in  the first sexually suggestive passage in verse 4, can describe the “spreading apart” of  two female body parts. The girl in verse 9 thus appears to be part of the “gift” that  Śyāvāśva received for his poem, and the complex set of double meanings in this verse  are certainly a worthy “praise of this gift.” Is the girl in this verse the same as the one  in verse 5? Śyāvāśva seems to imply this, but we will never know for sure.

Maruts For the structure of this hymn and its place in the series, see published introduction.

Although there is an itihāsa in the Bṛhaddevatā (V.50) that supposedly recounts the circumstances of Śyāvāśva’s composition, it was clearly constructed secondarily and fancifully on the basis of the Rigvedic text (see both Oldenberg and Geldner).
