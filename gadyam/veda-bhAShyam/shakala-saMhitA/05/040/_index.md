Indra and the Myth of Svarbhānu [Anukramaṇı: Indra ̄ 1–4, Sūrya 5, Atri 6–9]  
Atri Bhauma  
9 verses: uṣṇih 1–3, triṣṭubh 4, anuṣṭubh 5, 9, triṣṭubh 6–8  
This hymn falls into two parts. It opens with four verses praising Indra in his bull ish aspect, with hypnotic repetition of the word vŕ̥ṣan “bull.” The remainder (vss.  5–9) contains an allusive account of the myth of Svarbhānu, who “pierces the Sun  with darkness,” and the Sun’s rescue by the seer Atri, a myth much treated in middle  Vedic literature. For extensive discussion of the myth and this R̥gvedic version of it,  see Jamison (1991: Part II, pp. 131–303).  

The myth makes sense once the identity of the mysterious enemy of the Sun is  solved: Svarbhānu, literally “he who possesses the radiance of the sun,” is actu ally the Sun’s earthly counterpart, the god Agni. He punished the Sun for the lat ter’s incestuous intercourse with his daughter (not mentioned in this hymn, but  frequently found elsewhere), but because of the importance of sunlight for the  maintenance of the world, the Sun had to be restored by the seer Atri (also the  supposed poet of this hymn) through ritual means. The physical manifestations of  the Sun’s punishment betray his attacker’s identity: “pierced with darkness” refers  to sunspots, dark spots on the sun as if burnt by fire, and the enveloping darkness  of smoke is depicted in verse 6.  
Note that the Svarbhānu portion (5–9) is a perfect omphalos hymn. The two  outer verses (5, 9) are multiforms of each other and in a different meter from the  verses in between; the middle verse (7) is the only direct speech; the intermediate vss.  (6, 8) both mention Atri in the singular, both deal with the māyā́ (“magic spells”) of  Svarbhānu, and both have complementary vocabulary: diváḥ/diví, sū́ryam/sū́ryasya,  gūḷhám/aghukṣat, bráhmaṇā/brahmā́.
