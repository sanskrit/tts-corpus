All Gods  
Atri Bhauma  
17 verses: triṣṭubh, except ekapadā virāj 16  
Like many All God hymns, this one enumerates in individual verses divinities deserv ing praise, and the emphasis is on the ritual and the gods’ presence at and participa tion in it. There is perhaps more detail about ritual performance than in many such  hymns (see, e.g., vss. 1, 3–7), and this focus on the ritual is observable in two other  features of the hymn. On the one hand, the god Agni dominates the last part of  the hymn (vss. 12–15), under the name/epithet Br̥haspati in verse 12, unnamed but  clearly identified by his characteristics in verse 13, called Āyu in verse 14, and finally  named in verse 15ab. Such concentration on deified ritual fire in an All God hymn is  somewhat surprising. Further, the middle verse of this hymn (excluding the repeated  verses at the end), verse 7, is directed not toward a god but a ritual implement, the  gharma pot, used in the Pravargya ritual and often the focus of priestly speculation.
