**FOREWORD.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have perused Pandit R. V. Krishamachariar's *Harshacharita Laghu
Sangraha* which is a summary in Bana's words, of his brilliant
*Akhyayika*. I am glad to be able to say that it will prove to be of
good use to the Sanskrit students of the higher forms of *Secondary
Schools* and of the lower classes in the pre-collegiate section of
*Advanced Sanskrit Schools* in this province.

*Bhatta-Bana's* style is felt to be *simply irrittating* by alien
critics, whose minds have not become attuned and adequately responsive
to the charms of the Sanskrit Muse. But Indian *Sahrdayas* know well
that Bana's creative genius has beautified the firmament of Sanskrit
*belles-lettres* with two literary *rainbows*, one of the charming
*lunar* type in the *Kadambari* and the other of the brilliant *solar*
type in the *Harshacharita*. And the latter of them Mr. R. V.
Krishnamachariar has now miniatured in an agreeable manner, in his
*Harsha Charita Laghu Sangraha*, as he did in his *Kadambari Laghu
Sangraha* in 1923, with reference to the former.
