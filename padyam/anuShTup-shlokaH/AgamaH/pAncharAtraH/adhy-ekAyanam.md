- एकायनशाखा कठस्यैवोपशाखासीद् इत्यनिमेषः - द्वयोर् अपि काश्मीरमूलत्वात्।

> There is no record of an ekayana shakha in sukla yajur Veda. Rather pn texts talk abt kanva shakha only. Otoh a pancaratra sruti and pancaratra upanishad are quoted by kashmira shaiva acharyas like utpala. My presumption is that just as taittiriya shakha has vaikhanasa branch with its own mantrapatha, pancaratrins must have been of kanva shakha with some mantrapatha/sruti of their own.

> The primary pn guys have to be of kanva shakha following katyayana sutra. Should also belong to one of the five gotras - bhAradvaja, kaushika, maunjayana, aupagayana and another one.
> 
> Desikan quotes a katyayana upanishad as evidence for urdhvapundra. This upanishad is also published by adyar library. Said publication also has a sudarshanopanishad which has been quoted as well by Desikan.
