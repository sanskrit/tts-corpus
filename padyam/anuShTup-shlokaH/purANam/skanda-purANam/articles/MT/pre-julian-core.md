The standard "white indological" position is that the said skandapurAna was composed during the reign of emperor harShavardhana the puShyabhUti. However, the Greco-roman world was gone by then. We hold this date is wrong & that it was composed much earlier. The latest redactions to it like several purANa-s were probably classical gupta age. However, the material regarding these goddesses was likely much earlier than gupta going back to the time when the heathen Classical world actually existed & interacted with the H consciousness, i.e. pre-Julian.
